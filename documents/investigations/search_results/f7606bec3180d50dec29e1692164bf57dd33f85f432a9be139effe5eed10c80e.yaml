    Get rights and content Abstract Today’s wireless networks are characterized by
    a fixed spectrum assignment policy. However, a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    is used sporadically and geographical variations in the utilization of assigned
    spectrum ranges from 15% to 85% with a high variance in time. The limited available
    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new communication
    paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically. This new
    networking paradigm is referred to as NeXt Generation (xG) Networks as well as
    Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and cognitive radio networks. The term xG networks
    is used throughout the paper. The novel functionalities and current research challenges
    of the xG networks are explained in detail. More specifically, a brief overview
    of the cognitive radio technology is provided and the xG network architecture
    is introduced. Moreover, the xG network functions such as spectrum management,
    spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing are explained in detail. The influence
    of these functions on the performance of the upper layer protocols such as routing
    and transport are investigated and open research issues in these areas are also
    outlined. Finally, the cross-layer design challenges in xG networks are discussed.

    by a fixed spectrum assignment policy, i.e. the spectrum is regulated by governmental
    agencies and is assigned to license holders or services on a long term basis for
    large geographical regions. In addition, a large portion of the assigned spectrum
    is used sporadically as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the signal strength distribution
    over a large portion of the wireless spectrum is shown. The spectrum usage is
    concentrated on certain portions of the spectrum while a significant amount of
    the spectrum remains unutilized. According to Federal Communications Commission
    (FCC) [20], temporal and geographical variations in the utilization of the assigned
    spectrum range from 15% to 85%. Although the fixed spectrum assignment policy
    generally served well in the past, there is a dramatic increase in the access
    to the limited spectrum for mobile services in the recent years. This increase
    is straining the effectiveness of the traditional spectrum policies. Download

    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new communication
    paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically [3]. Dynamic
    spectrum access is proposed to solve these current spectrum inefficiency problems.
    DARPAs approach on Dynamic Spectrum Access network, the so-called NeXt Generation
    (xG) program aims to implement the policy based intelligent radios known as cognitive
    radios [67], [68]. NeXt Generation (xG) communication networks, also known as
    Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DSANs) as well as cognitive radio networks,
    will provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures
    and dynamic spectrum access techniques. The inefficient usage of the existing
    spectrum can be improved through opportunistic access to the licensed bands without
    interfering with the existing users. xG networks, however, impose several research
    challenges due to the broad range of available spectrum as well as diverse Quality-of-Service
    (QoS) requirements of applications. These heterogeneities must be captured and
    handled dynamically as mobile terminals roam between wireless architectures and
    along the available spectrum pool. The key enabling technology of xG networks
    is the cognitive radio. Cognitive radio techniques provide the capability to use
    or share the spectrum in an opportunistic manner. Dynamic spectrum access techniques
    allow the cognitive radio to operate in the best available channel. More specifically,
    the cognitive radio technology will enable the users to (1) determine which portions
    of the spectrum is available and detect the presence of licensed users when a
    user operates in a licensed band (spectrum sensing), (2) select the best available
    channel (spectrum management), (3) coordinate access to this channel with other
    users (spectrum sharing), and (4) vacate the channel when a licensed user is detected
    (spectrum mobility). Once a cognitive radio supports the capability to select
    the best available channel, the next challenge is to make the network protocols
    adaptive to the available spectrum. Hence, new functionalities are required in
    an xG network to support this adaptivity. In summary, the main functions for cognitive
    radios in xG networks can be summarized as follows: • Spectrum sensing: Detecting
    unused spectrum and sharing the spectrum without harmful interference with other
    users. • Spectrum management: Capturing the best available spectrum to meet user
    communication requirements. • Spectrum mobility: Maintaining seamless communication
    requirements during the transition to better spectrum. • Spectrum sharing: Providing
    the fair spectrum scheduling method among coexisting xG users. These functionalities
    of xG networks enable spectrum-aware communication protocols. However, the dynamic
    use of the spectrum causes adverse effects on the performance of conventional
    communication protocols, which were developed considering a fixed frequency band
    for communication. So far, networking in xG networks is an unexplored topic. In
    this paper, we also capture the intrinsic challenges for networking in xG networks
    and lay out guidelines for further research in this area. More specifically, we
    overview the recent proposals for spectrum sharing and routing in xG networks
    as well as the challenges for transport protocols. Moreover, the effect of cross-layer
    design is addressed for communication in xG networks. The xG network communication
    components and their interactions are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is evident from
    the significant number of interactions that the xG network functionalities necessitate
    a cross-layer design approach. More specifically, spectrum sensing and spectrum
    sharing cooperate with each other to enhance spectrum efficiency. In spectrum
    management and spectrum mobility functions, application, transport, routing, medium
    access and physical layer functionalities are carried out in a cooperative way,
    considering the dynamic nature of the underlying spectrum. Download : Download

    a definition, functions and current research challenges of the xG networks. In
    Section 2, we provide a brief overview of the cognitive radio technology. The
    xG network architectures on licensed band and on unlicensed band are presented

    features influence the performance of the upper layer protocols, i.e., routing
    and transport. Finally, we explain how xG functions can be implemented in a cross-layer
    approach in Section 9 and conclude the paper in Section 10. 2. Cognitive radio
    Cognitive radio technology is the key technology that enables an xG network to
    use spectrum in a dynamic manner. The term, cognitive radio, can formally be defined
    as follows [20]: A “Cognitive Radio” is a radio that can change its transmitter
    parameters based on interaction with the environment in which it operates. From
    this definition, two main characteristics of the cognitive radio can be defined
    [27], [58]: • Cognitive capability: Cognitive capability refers to the ability
    of the radio technology to capture or sense the information from its radio environment.
    This capability cannot simply be realized by monitoring the power in some frequency
    band of interest but more sophisticated techniques are required in order to capture
    the temporal and spatial variations in the radio environment and avoid interference
    to other users. Through this capability, the portions of the spectrum that are
    unused at a specific time or location can be identified. Consequently, the best
    spectrum and appropriate operating parameters can be selected. • Reconfigurability:
    The cognitive capability provides spectrum awareness whereas reconfigurability
    enables the radio to be dynamically programmed according to the radio environment.
    More specifically, the cognitive radio can be programmed to transmit and receive
    on a variety of frequencies and to use different transmission access technologies
    supported by its hardware design [34]. The cognitive radio concept was first introduced
    in [45], [46], where the main focus was on the radio knowledge representation
    language (RKRL) and how the cognitive radio can enhance the flexibility of personal
    wireless services. The cognitive radio is regarded as a small part of the physical
    world to use and provide information from environment. The ultimate objective
    of the cognitive radio is to obtain the best available spectrum through cognitive
    capability and reconfigurability as described before. Since most of the spectrum
    is already assigned, the most important challenge is to share the licensed spectrum
    without interfering with the transmission of other licensed users as illustrated
    in Fig. 3. The cognitive radio enables the usage of temporally unused spectrum,
    which is referred to as spectrum hole or white space [27]. If this band is further
    used by a licensed user, the cognitive radio moves to another spectrum hole or
    stays in the same band, altering its transmission power level or modulation scheme
    to avoid interference as shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Spectrum hole concept. In the following subsections, we describe the physical
    architecture, cognitive functions and reconfigurability capabilities of the cognitive
    radio technology. 2.1. Physical architecture of the cognitive radio A generic
    architecture of a cognitive radio transceiver is shown in Fig. 4(a) [34]. The
    main components of a cognitive radio transceiver are the radio front-end and the
    baseband processing unit. Each component can be reconfigured via a control bus
    to adapt to the time-varying RF environment. In the RF front-end, the received
    signal is amplified, mixed and A/D converted. In the baseband processing unit,
    the signal is modulated/demodulated and encoded/decoded. The baseband processing
    unit of a cognitive radio is essentially similar to existing transceivers. However,
    the novelty of the cognitive radio is the RF front-end. Hence, next, we focus
    on the RF front-end of the cognitive radios. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. Physical architecture of the cognitive radio [12], [34]: (a) Cognitive
    radio transceiver and (b) wideband RF/analog front-end architecture. The novel
    characteristic of cognitive radio transceiver is a wideband sensing capability
    of the RF front-end. This function is mainly related to RF hardware technologies
    such as wideband antenna, power amplifier, and adaptive filter. RF hardware for
    the cognitive radio should be capable of tuning to any part of a large range of
    frequency spectrum. Also such spectrum sensing enables real-time measurements
    of spectrum information from radio environment. Generally, a wideband front-end
    architecture for the cognitive radio has the following structure as shown in Fig.
    4(b) [12]. The components of a cognitive radio RF front-end are as follows: •
    RF filter: The RF filter selects the desired band by bandpass filtering the received
    RF signal. • Low noise amplifier (LNA): The LNA amplifies the desired signal while
    simultaneously minimizing noise component. • Mixer: In the mixer, the received
    signal is mixed with locally generated RF frequency and converted to the baseband
    or the intermediate frequency (IF). • Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO): The
    VCO generates a signal at a specific frequency for a given voltage to mix with
    the incoming signal. This procedure converts the incoming signal to baseband or
    an intermediate frequency. • Phase locked loop (PLL): The PLL ensures that a signal
    is locked on a specific frequency and can also be used to generate precise frequencies
    with fine resolution. • Channel selection filter: The channel selection filter
    is used to select the desired channel and to reject the adjacent channels. There
    are two types of channel selection filters [52]. The direct conversion receiver
    uses a low-pass filter for the channel selection. On the other hand, the superheterodyne
    receiver adopts a bandpass filter. • Automatic gain control (AGC): The AGC maintains
    the gain or output power level of an amplifier constant over a wide range of input
    signal levels. In this architecture, a wideband signal is received through the
    RF front-end, sampled by the high speed analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, and
    measurements are performed for the detection of the licensed user signal. However,
    there exist some limitations on developing the cognitive radio front-end. The
    wideband RF antenna receives signals from various transmitters operating at different
    power levels, bandwidths, and locations. As a result, the RF front-end should
    have the capability to detect a weak signal in a large dynamic range. However,
    this capability requires a multi-GHz speed A/D converter with high resolution,
    which might be infeasible [12], [13]. The requirement of a multi-GHz speed A/D
    converter necessitates the dynamic range of the signal to be reduced before A/D
    conversion. This reduction can be achieved by filtering strong signals. Since
    strong signals can be located anywhere in the wide spectrum range, tunable notch
    filters are required for the reduction [12]. Another approach is to use multiple
    antennas such that signal filtering is performed in the spatial domain rather
    than in the frequency domain. Multiple antennas can receive signals selectively
    using beamforming techniques [13]. As explained previously, the key challenge
    of the physical architecture of the cognitive radio is an accurate detection of
    weak signals of licensed users over a wide spectrum range. Hence, the implementation
    of RF wideband front-end and A/D converter are critical issues in xG networks.
    2.2. Cognitive capability The cognitive capability of a cognitive radio enables
    real time interaction with its environment to determine appropriate communication
    parameters and adapt to the dynamic radio environment. The tasks required for
    adaptive operation in open spectrum are shown in Fig. 5 [27], [46], [58], which
    is referred to as the cognitive cycle. In this section, we provide an overview
    of the three main steps of the cognitive cycle: spectrum sensing, spectrum analysis,
    and spectrum decision. The details and the related work of these functions are
    described in Sections 4 Spectrum sensing, 5 Spectrum management. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Cognitive cycle. The steps of the cognitive cycle as shown
    in Fig. 5 are as follows: 1. Spectrum sensing: A cognitive radio monitors the
    available spectrum bands, captures their information, and then detects the spectrum
    holes. 2. Spectrum analysis: The characteristics of the spectrum holes that are
    detected through spectrum sensing are estimated. 3. Spectrum decision: A cognitive
    radio determines the data rate, the transmission mode, and the bandwidth of the
    transmission. Then, the appropriate spectrum band is chosen according to the spectrum
    characteristics and user requirements. Once the operating spectrum band is determined,
    the communication can be performed over this spectrum band. However, since the
    radio environment changes over time and space, the cognitive radio should keep
    track of the changes of the radio environment. If the current spectrum band in
    use becomes unavailable, the spectrum mobility function that will be explained
    in Section 6, is performed to provide a seamless transmission. Any environmental
    change during the transmission such as primary user appearance, user movement,
    or traffic variation can trigger this adjustment. 2.3. Reconfigurability Reconfigurability
    is the capability of adjusting operating parameters for the transmission on the
    fly without any modifications on the hardware components. This capability enables
    the cognitive radio to adapt easily to the dynamic radio environment. There are
    several reconfigurable parameters that can be incorporated into the cognitive
    radio [20] as explained below: • Operating frequency: A cognitive radio is capable
    of changing the operating frequency. Based on the information about the radio
    environment, the most suitable operating frequency can be determined and the communication
    can be dynamically performed on this appropriate operating frequency. • Modulation:
    A cognitive radio should reconfigure the modulation scheme adaptive to the user
    requirements and channel conditions. For example, in the case of delay sensitive
    applications, the data rate is more important than the error rate. Thus, the modulation
    scheme that enables the higher spectral efficiency should be selected. Conversely,
    the loss-sensitive applications focus on the error rate, which necessitate modulation
    schemes with low bit error rate. • Transmission power: Transmission power can
    be reconfigured within the power constraints. Power control enables dynamic transmission
    power configuration within the permissible power limit. If higher power operation
    is not necessary, the cognitive radio reduces the transmitter power to a lower
    level to allow more users to share the spectrum and to decrease the interference.
    • Communication technology: A cognitive radio can also be used to provide interoperability
    among different communication systems. The transmission parameters of a cognitive
    radio can be reconfigured not only at the beginning of a transmission but also
    during the transmission. According to the spectrum characteristics, these parameters
    can be reconfigured such that the cognitive radio is switched to a different spectrum
    band, the transmitter and receiver parameters are reconfigured and the appropriate
    communication protocol parameters and modulation schemes are used. 3. The xG network
    architecture Existing wireless network architectures employ heterogeneity in terms
    of both spectrum policies and communication technologies [3]. Moreover, some portion
    of the wireless spectrum is already licensed to different purposes while some
    bands remain unlicensed. For the development of communication protocols, a clear
    description of the xG network architecture is essential. In this section, the
    xG network architecture is presented such that all possible scenarios are considered.
    The components of the xG network architecture, as shown in Fig. 6, can be classified
    in two groups as the primary network and the xG network. The basic elements of
    the primary and the xG network are defined as follows: • Primary network: An existing
    network infrastructure is generally referred to as the primary network, which
    has an exclusive right to a certain spectrum band. Examples include the common
    cellular and TV broadcast networks. The components of the primary network are
    as follows: – Primary user: Primary user (or licensed user) has a license to operate
    in a certain spectrum band. This access can only be controlled by the primary
    base-station and should not be affected by the operations of any other unlicensed
    users. Primary users do not need any modification or additional functions for
    coexistence with xG base-stations and xG users. – Primary base-station: Primary
    base-station (or licensed base-station) is a fixed infrastructure network component
    which has a spectrum license such as base-station transceiver system (BTS) in
    a cellular system. In principle, the primary base-station does not have any xG
    capability for sharing spectrum with xG users. However, the primary base-station
    may be requested to have both legacy and xG protocols for the primary network
    access of xG users, which is explained below. • xG network: xG network (or cognitive
    radio network, Dynamic Spectrum Access network, secondary network, unlicensed
    network) does not have license to operate in a desired band. Hence, the spectrum
    access is allowed only in an opportunistic manner. xG networks can be deployed
    both as an infrastructure network and an ad hoc network as shown in Fig. 6. The
    components of an xG network are as follows: – xG user: xG user (or unlicensed
    user, cognitive radio user, secondary user) has no spectrum license. Hence, additional
    functionalities are required to share the licensed spectrum band. – xG base-station:
    xG base-station (or unlicensed base-station, secondary base-station) is a fixed
    infrastructure component with xG capabilities. xG base-station provides single
    hop connection to xG users without spectrum access license. Through this connection,
    an xG user can access other networks. – Spectrum broker: Spectrum broker (or scheduling
    server) is a central network entity that plays a role in sharing the spectrum
    resources among different xG networks. Spectrum broker can be connected to each
    network and can serve as a spectrum information manager to enable coexistence
    of multiple xG networks [10], [32], [70]. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. xG network architecture. The reference xG network architecture is shown
    in Fig. 6, which consists of different types of networks: a primary network, an
    infrastructure based xG network, and an ad-hoc xG network. xG networks are operated
    under the mixed spectrum environment that consists of both licensed and unlicensed
    bands. Also, xG users can either communicate with each other in a multihop manner
    or access the base-station. Thus, in xG networks, there are three different access
    types as explained next: • xG network access: xG users can access their own xG
    base-station both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands. • xG ad hoc access:
    xG users can communicate with other xG users through ad hoc connection on both
    licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands. • Primary network access: The xG users
    can also access the primary base-station through the licensed band. According
    to the reference architecture shown in Fig. 6, various functionalities are required
    to support the heterogeneity in xG networks. In Section 3.1, we describe the xG
    network functions to support the heterogeneity of the network environment. Moreover,
    in Sections 3.2 xG network applications, 3.3 Existing architectures, we overview
    xG network applications and existing architectures. 3.1. xG network functions
    As explained before, xG network can operate in both licensed and unlicensed bands.
    Hence, the functionalities required for xG networks vary according to whether
    the spectrum is licensed or unlicensed. Accordingly, in this section, we classify
    the xG network operations as xG network on licensed band and xG network on unlicensed
    band. The xG network functions are explained in the following sections according
    to this classification. 3.1.1. xG network on licensed band As shown in Fig. 1,
    there exist temporally unused spectrum holes in the licensed spectrum band. Hence,
    xG networks can be deployed to exploit these spectrum holes through cognitive
    communication techniques. This architecture is depicted in Fig. 7, where the xG
    network coexists with the primary network at the same location and on the same
    spectrum band. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. xG network on licensed
    band. There are various challenges for xG networks on licensed band due to the
    existence of the primary users. Although the main purpose of the xG network is
    to determine the best available spectrum, xG functions in the licensed band are
    mainly aimed at the detection of the presence of primary users. The channel capacity
    of the spectrum holes depends on the interference at the nearby primary users.
    Thus, the interference avoidance with primary users is the most important issue
    in this architecture. Furthermore, if primary users appear in the spectrum band
    occupied by xG users, xG users should vacate the current spectrum band and move
    to the new available spectrum immediately, called spectrum handoff. 3.1.2. xG
    network on unlicensed band Open spectrum policy that began in the industrial scientific
    and medical (ISM) band has caused an impressive variety of important technologies
    and innovative uses. However, due to the interference among multiple heterogeneous
    networks, the spectrum efficiency of ISM band is decreasing. Ultimately, the capacity
    of open spectrum access, and the quality of service they can offer, depend on
    the degree to which a radio can be designed to allocate spectrum efficiently.
    xG networks can be designed for operation on unlicensed bands such that the efficiency
    is improved in this portion of the spectrum. The xG network on unlicensed band
    architecture is illustrated in Fig. 8. Since there are no license holders, all
    network entities have the same right to access the spectrum bands. Multiple xG
    networks coexist in the same area and communicate using the same portion of the
    spectrum. Intelligent spectrum sharing algorithms can improve the efficiency of
    spectrum usage and support high QoS. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    8. xG network on unlicensed band. In this architecture, xG users focus on detecting
    the transmissions of other xG users. Unlike the licensed band operations, the
    spectrum handoff is not triggered by the appearance of other primary users. However,
    since all xG users have the same right to access the spectrum, xG users should
    compete with each other for the same unlicensed band. Thus, sophisticated spectrum
    sharing methods among xG users are required in this architecture. If multiple
    xG network operators reside in the same unlicensed band, fair spectrum sharing
    among these networks is also required. 3.2. xG network applications xG networks
    can be applied to the following cases: Leased network: The primary network can
    provide a leased network by allowing opportunistic access to its licensed spectrum
    with the agreement with a third party without sacrificing the service quality
    of the primary user [56]. For example, the primary network can lease its spectrum
    access right to a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). Also the primary network
    can provide its spectrum access rights to a regional community for the purpose
    of broadband access. Cognitive mesh network: Wireless mesh networks are emerging
    as a cost-effective technology for providing broadband connectivity [4]. However,
    as the network density increases and the applications require higher throughput,
    mesh networks require higher capacity to meet the requirements of the applications.
    Since the cognitive radio technology enables the access to larger amount of spectrum,
    xG networks can be used for mesh networks that will be deployed in dense urban
    areas with the possibility of significant contention [38]. For example, the coverage
    area of xG networks can be increased when a meshed wireless backbone network of
    infrastructure links is established based on cognitive access points (CAPs) and
    fixed cognitive relay nodes (CRNs) [6]. The capacity of a CAP, connected via a
    wired broadband access to the Internet, is distributed into a large area with
    the help of a fixed CRN. xG networks have the ability to add temporary or permanent
    spectrum to the infrastructure links used for relaying in case of high traffic
    load. Emergency network: Public safety and emergency networks are another area
    in which xG networks can be implemented [41]. In the case of natural disasters,
    which may temporarily disable or destroy existing communication infrastructure,
    emergency personnel working in the disaster areas need to establish emergency
    networks. Since emergency networks deal with the critical information, reliable
    communication should be guaranteed with minimum latency. In addition, emergency
    communication requires a significant amount of radio spectrum for handling huge
    volume of traffic including voice, video and data. xG networks can enable the
    usage of the existing spectrum without the need for an infrastructure and by maintaining
    communication priority and response time. Military network: One of the most interesting
    potential applications of an xG network is in a military radio environment [47].
    xG networks can enable the military radios choose arbitrary, intermediate frequency
    (IF) bandwidth, modulation schemes, and coding schemes, adapting to the variable
    radio environment of battlefield. Also military networks have a strong need for
    security and protection of the communication in hostile environment. xG networks
    could allow military personnel to perform spectrum handoff to find secure spectrum
    band for themselves and their allies. 3.3. Existing architectures The main representative
    examples of the xG network architectures are described in this section. Spectrum
    pooling: In [61], [62], a centralized spectrum pooling architecture is proposed
    based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This architecture
    consists of an xG base-station and mobile xG users. OFDM has the advantage of
    feeding certain sub-carriers with zeros resulting in no emission of radio power
    on the carriers that are occupied by the licensed users. The licensed user detection
    is performed through detection frames that are periodically broadcast by the base-station.
    During the detection frames, the mobile users perform spectrum sensing. The sensing
    information is then gathered at the base-station. Mobile terminals modulate a
    complex symbol at maximum power in the sub-carriers where a licensed user appears.
    Through this operation, the base-station receives an amplified signal on all sub-carriers
    with new licensed users. Physical and MAC layer issues, such as detection of spectral
    access, scheduling, and handoff are ongoing investigations in this architecture.
    CORVUS: In [8], [14], a cognitive radio approach for usage of virtual unlicensed
    spectrum (CORVUS) system is presented to exploit unoccupied licensed bands. In
    CORVUS, based on the local spectrum sensing, the primary user detection and the
    spectrum allocation are performed in a coordinated manner. This cooperative effort
    greatly increases the system’s ability in identifying and avoiding primary users.
    In CORVUS, a group of users form a secondary user group (SUG) to coordinate their
    communication. Each member of this group senses the spectrum pool, which is divided
    into sub-channels. A universal control channel is used by all groups for coordination
    and separate group control channels are used by the members of a group to exchange
    sensing information and establish secondary user links. The performance of the
    physical and link layers are evaluated through the CORVUS testbed [44]. Moreover,
    recently, a reliable link maintenance protocol is proposed within CORVUS to maintain
    the quality of secondary user communication [64]. IEEE 802.22: IEEE 802.22 is
    the first worldwide standard based on the cognitive radio technology [16], [31]
    and is now in the process of standardization. This project, formally called the
    standard for wireless regional area networks (WRAN), focuses on constructing fixed
    point-to-multipoint WRAN that will utilize UHF/VHF TV bands between 54 and 862
    MHz. Specific TV channels as well as guard bands will be used for communication
    in IEEE 802.22. The IEEE 802.22 system specifies a fixed point-to-multipoint wireless
    air interface whereby a base-station manages its own cell and all associated users,
    which are denoted as consumer premise equipments (CPEs). IEEE 802.22 base-station
    manages a unique feature of distributed sensing. This is needed to ensure proper
    incumbent protection and is managed by the base-station, which instructs the various
    CPEs to perform distributed measurement activities. The IEEE 802.22 system specifies
    spectral efficiencies in the range of 0.5–5 bit/s/Hz. A distinctive feature of
    IEEE 802.22 WRAN as compared to the existing IEEE 802 standards is the base-station
    coverage range, which can go up to 100 km if the power is not an issue. Current
    specified coverage range is 33 km at 4 W CPE effective isotropic radiated power
    (EIRP) [66]. Table 1 depicts the capacity and coverage of IEEE 802.22 WRAN system.
    IEEE 802.22 working group was formed in 2004 and has finalized the specification
    of technical requirements. The first draft of IEEE 802.22 standard will be ready
    around mid 2006. Table 1. IEEE 802.22 WRAN system capacity and coverage [65] RF

    TV channel can provide service to up to 600 subscribers. The area that the Wireless
    Regional Area network (WRAN) operator needs to cover should include enough subscribers
    to make it economically viable early in the process when the take-up rate is low.
    This will define the potential subscriber base and the population density for
    a sustainable business case. DIMSUMnet: The dynamic intelligent management of
    spectrum for ubiquitous mobile network (DIMSUMnet) [10] implements statistically
    multiplexed access (SMA) to spectrum in the coordinated access band (CAB). While
    the CAB improves the spectrum access efficiency and fairness, the SMA is focused
    on improving the spectrum utilization. CAB is a contiguous chunk of spectrum reserved
    by regulating authorities. A spectrum broker permanently owns the CAB and leases
    it according to requests. DIMSUMnet uses a centralized, regional network level
    brokering mechanism that aims to significantly improve spectrum utilization while
    reducing the complexity and the agility requirements of the deployed system. The
    base-station registers with its designated radio access network manager (RANMAN),
    which negotiates a lease with a spectrum information and management (SPIM) broker
    for an appropriate portion of the spectrum. If the lease is successfully obtained,
    the RANMAN configures the leased spectrum in the base-station. The base-station
    sends the spectrum information received from the RANMAN to its users for the configuration
    of client. The spectrum utilization of DIMSUMnet is currently measured in existing
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile communication
    (GSM) cellular networks, aimed at characterizing feasibility of CAB and SMA [35].
    Recent work focuses on the spectrum pricing and allocation functions for spectrum
    brokers [11]. DRiVE/OverDRiVE project: The European Dynamic Radio for IP Services
    in Vehicular Environments (DRiVE) project focuses on dynamic spectrum allocation
    in heterogeneous networks by assuming a common coordinated channel [75]. The follow-up
    project, Spectrum Efficient Uni- and Multicast Over Dynamic Radio Networks in
    Vehicular Environments (OverDRiVE) aims at UMTS enhancements and coordination
    of existing radio networks into a hybrid network to ensure spectrum efficient
    provision of mobile multimedia services [26]. Two aspects of dynamic spectrum
    allocation were investigated in DRiVE/OverDRiVE, i.e., temporal dynamic spectrum
    allocation (DSA), and spatial DSA [39]. In the case of the temporal DSA, a radio
    access network (RAN) can use the spectrum that is not currently being used by
    other RANs, at that time. On the other hand, spatial DSA allows spectrum allocations
    to adapt to regional fluctuations in traffic demands. The efficiency of these
    DSA schemes depends on the ability to predict the traffic load. Although these
    projects have shown significant potential for increasing spectral efficiency,
    the reconfigurable system implementation for temporal and spatial DSA is still
    a major challenge. Nautilus: Nautilus project is designed to emphasize distributed
    coordination enabled spectrum sharing, without relying on centralized control
    [48]. In the Nautilus project, a distributed, scalable and efficient coordination
    framework for open spectrum ad hoc networks is proposed, which accounts for spectrum
    heterogeneity while not relying on the existence of a pre-defined common channel
    for control traffic [73], [74]. Based on this framework, three different collaborative
    spectrum access schemes are presented. In [73], a graph coloring based collaborative
    spectrum access scheme is proposed, where a topology-optimized allocation algorithm
    is used for the fixed topology. In mobile networks, however, the network topology
    changes due to the node mobility. Using this global optimization approach, the
    network needs to completely recompute spectrum assignments for all users after
    each change, resulting in high computational and communication overhead. Thus,
    distributed spectrum allocation based on local bargaining is proposed in [15],
    where mobile users negotiate spectrum assignment within local self-organized groups.
    For the resource constrained networks such as sensor and ad hoc network, rule-based
    device centric spectrum management is proposed, where unlicensed users access
    the spectrum independently according to both local observation and predetermined
    rules. Currently, this project focuses on selecting the best channel for data
    transmission using proposed distributed coordination framework. OCRA network:
    In [5], an OFDM-based cognitive radio (OCRA) network is proposed. OCRA network
    considers all possible deployment scenarios over the heterogeneous xG network
    environment and develops cross-layer operations for the OFDM based dynamic spectrum
    access. OCRA network architecture and its components are shown in Fig. 6. For
    the spectrum decision and the spectrum handoff, OCRA network provides a novel
    concept of an OFDM-based spectrum management over the heterogeneous spectrum environment.
    Based on this physical layer (PHY) structure, a dual-mode spectrum sharing framework
    is proposed, which enables access to existing networks as well as coordination
    between xG users. Furthermore, a new routing paradigm that considers joint re-routing
    and spectrum handoff is proposed. Moreover, OCRA network introduces multi-spectrum
    transport techniques to exploit the available but non-contiguous wireless spectrum
    for high quality communication. In [5], the testbed design for evaluation and
    integration of the OCRA network is proposed. The OCRA testbed is based on IEEE
    802.11a/g technology, which exploits the OFDM technology. Moreover, a standalone
    cognitive sensing unit is developed to emulate the spectrum sensing capabilities
    of the cognitive radio. 4. Spectrum sensing An important requirement of the xG
    network is to sense the spectrum holes. As explained in Section 2, a cognitive
    radio is designed to be aware of and sensitive to the changes in its surrounding.
    The spectrum sensing function enables the cognitive radio to adapt to its environment
    by detecting spectrum holes. The most efficient way to detect spectrum holes is
    to detect the primary users that are receiving data within the communication range
    of an xG user. In reality, however, it is difficult for a cognitive radio to have
    a direct measurement of a channel between a primary receiver and a transmitter.
    Thus, the most recent work focuses on primary transmitter detection based on local
    observations of xG users. Generally, the spectrum sensing techniques can be classified
    as transmitter detection, cooperative detection, and interference-based detection,
    as shown in Fig. 9. In the following sections, we describe these spectrum sensing
    methods for xG networks and discuss the open research topics in this area. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Classification of spectrum sensing techniques.
    4.1. Transmitter detection (non-cooperative detection) The cognitive radio should
    distinguish between used and unused spectrum bands. Thus, the cognitive radio
    should have capability to determine if a signal from primary transmitter is locally
    present in a certain spectrum. Transmitter detection approach is based on the
    detection of the weak signal from a primary transmitter through the local observations
    of xG users. Basic hypothesis model for transmitter detection can be defined as
    follows [25]: (1) where x(t) is the signal received by the xG user, s(t) is the
    transmitted signal of the primary user, n(t) is the AWGN and h is the amplitude
    gain of the channel. H0 is a null hypothesis, which states that there is no licensed
    user signal in a certain spectrum band. On the other hand, H1 is an alternative
    hypothesis, which indicates that there exist some licensed user signal. Three
    schemes are generally used for the transmitter detection according to the hypothesis
    model [53]. In the following subsections, we investigate matched filter detection,
    energy detection and cyclostationary feature detection techniques proposed for
    transmitter detection in xG networks. 4.1.1. Matched filter detection When the
    information of the primary user signal is known to the xG user, the optimal detector
    in stationary Gaussian noise is the matched filter since it maximizes the received
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [53]. While the main advantage of the matched filter
    is that it requires less time to achieve high processing gain due to coherency,
    it requires a priori knowledge of the primary user signal such as the modulation
    type and order, the pulse shape, and the packet format. Hence, if this information
    is not accurate, then the matched filter performs poorly. However, since most
    wireless network systems have pilot, preambles, synchronization word or spreading
    codes, these can be used for the coherent detection. 4.1.2. Energy detection If
    the receiver cannot gather sufficient information about the primary user signal,
    for example, if the power of the random Gaussian noise is only known to the receiver,
    the optimal detector is an energy detector [53]. In order to measure the energy
    of the received signal, the output signal of bandpass filter with bandwidth W
    is squared and integrated over the observation interval T. Finally, the output
    of the integrator, Y, is compared with a threshold, λ, to decide whether a licensed
    user is present or not [17]. If the energy detection can be applied in a non-fading
    environment where h is the amplitude gain of the channel as shown in (1), the
    probability of detection Pd and false alarm Pf are given as follows [17]: (2)
    (3) where γ is the SNR, u = TW is the time bandwidth product, Γ(·) and Γ(·, ·)
    are complete and incomplete gamma functions and Qm( ) is the generalized Marcum
    Q-function. From the above functions, while a low Pd would result in missing the
    presence of the primary user with high probability which in turn increases the
    interference to the primary user, a high Pf would result in low spectrum utilization
    since false alarms increase the number of missed opportunities. Since it is easy
    to implement, the recent work on detection of the primary user has generally adopted
    the energy detector [23], [53]. In [25], the shadowing and the multi-path fading
    factors are considered for the energy detector. In this case, while Pf is independent
    of Γ, when the amplitude gain of the channel, h, varies due to the shadowing/fading,
    Pd gives the probability of the detection conditioned on instantaneous SNR as
    follows: (4) where fγ(x) is the probability distribution function of SNR under
    fading. However, the performance of energy detector is susceptible to uncertainty
    in noise power. In order to solve this problem, a pilot tone from the primary
    transmitter is used to help improve the accuracy of the energy detector in [53].
    Another shortcoming is that the energy detector cannot differentiate signal types
    but can only determine the presence of the signal. Thus, the energy detector is
    prone to the false detection triggered by the unintended signals. 4.1.3. Cyclostationary
    feature detection An alternative detection method is the cyclostationary feature
    detection [12], [22], [57]. Modulated signals are in general coupled with sine
    wave carriers, pulse trains, repeating spreading, hopping sequences, or cyclic
    prefixes, which result in built-in periodicity. These modulated signals are characterized
    as cyclostationarity since their mean and autocorrelation exhibit periodicity.
    These features are detected by analyzing a spectral correlation function. The
    main advantage of the spectral correlation function is that it differentiates
    the noise energy from modulated signal energy, which is a result of the fact that
    the noise is a wide-sense stationary signal with no correlation, while modulated
    signals are cyclostationary with spectral correlation due to the embedded redundancy
    of signal periodicity. Therefore, a cyclostationary feature detector can perform
    better than the energy detector in discriminating against noise due to its robustness
    to the uncertainty in noise power [57]. However, it is computationally complex
    and requires significantly long observation time. For more efficient and reliable
    performance, the enhanced feature detection scheme combining cyclic spectral analysis
    with pattern recognition based on neural networks is proposed in [22]. Distinct
    features of the received signal are extracted using cyclic spectral analysis and
    represented by both spectral coherent function and spectral correlation density
    function. The neural network, then, classifies signals into different modulation
    types. 4.2. Cooperative detection The assumption of the primary transmitter detection
    is that the locations of the primary receivers are unknown due to the absence
    of signalling between primary users and the xG users. Therefore, the cognitive
    radio should rely on only weak primary transmitter signals based on the local
    observation of the xG user [72], [73]. However, in most cases, an xG network is
    physically separated from the primary network so there is no interaction between
    them. Thus, with the transmitter detection, the xG user cannot avoid the interference
    due to the lack of the primary receiver’s information as depicted in Fig. 10(a).
    Moreover, the transmitter detection model cannot prevent the hidden terminal problem.
    An xG transmitter can have a good line-of-sight to a receiver, but may not be
    able to detect the transmitter due to the shadowing as shown in Fig. 10(b). Consequently,
    the sensing information from other users is required for more accurate detection.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Transmitter detection problem: (a)
    Receiver uncertainty and (b) shadowing uncertainty. In the case of non-cooperative
    detection explained in Section 4.1, the xG users detect the primary transmitter
    signal independently through their local observations. Cooperative detection refers
    to spectrum sensing methods where information from multiple xG users are incorporated
    for primary user detection. Cooperative detection can be implemented either in
    a centralized or in a distributed manner [23], [71]. In the centralized method,
    the xG base-station plays a role to gather all sensing information from the xG
    users and detect the spectrum holes. On the other hand, distributed solutions
    require exchange of observations among xG users. Cooperative detection among unlicensed
    users is theoretically more accurate since the uncertainty in a single user’s
    detection can be minimized [25]. Moreover, the multi-path fading and shadowing
    effect are the main factors that degrade the performance of primary user detection
    methods [44]. However, cooperative detection schemes allow to mitigate the multi-path
    fading and shadowing effects, which improves the detection probability in a heavily
    shadowed environment [25]. In [55], the limitation of non-cooperative spectrum
    sensing approaches is investigated. Generally, the data transmission and sensing
    function are co-located in a single xG user device. However, this architecture
    can result in suboptimal spectrum decision due to possible conflicts between data
    transmission and sensing. In order to solve this problem, in [55], two distinct
    networks are deployed separately, i.e., the sensor network for cooperative spectrum
    sensing and the operational network for data transmission. The sensor network
    is deployed in the desired target area and senses the spectrum. A central controller
    processes the spectrum information collected from sensors and makes the spectrum
    occupancy map for the operational network. The operational network uses this information
    to determine the available spectrum. While cooperative approaches provide more
    accurate sensing performance, they cause adverse effects on resource-constrained
    networks due to the additional operations and overhead traffic. Furthermore, the
    primary receiver uncertainty problem caused by the lack of the primary receiver
    location knowledge is still unsolved in the cooperative sensing. In the following
    section, we explain interference-based detection methods, which aim to address
    these problems. 4.3. Interference-based detection Interference is typically regulated
    in a transmitter-centric way, which means interference can be controlled at the
    transmitter through the radiated power, the out-of-band emissions and location
    of individual transmitters. However, interference actually takes place at the
    receivers, as shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). Therefore recently, a new model for
    measuring interference, referred to as interference temperature shown in Fig.
    11 has been introduced by the FCC [21]. The model shows the signal of a radio
    station designed to operate in a range at which the received power approaches
    the level of the noise floor. As additional interfering signals appear, the noise
    floor increases at various points within the service area, as indicated by the
    peaks above the original noise floor. Unlike the traditional transmitter-centric
    approach, the interference temperature model manages interference at the receiver
    through the interference temperature limit, which is represented by the amount
    of new interference that the receiver could tolerate. In other words, the interference
    temperature model accounts for the cumulative RF energy from multiple transmissions
    and sets a maximum cap on their aggregate level. As long as xG users do not exceed
    this limit by their transmissions, they can use this spectrum band. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 11. Interference temperature model [21]. However,
    there exist some limitations in measuring the interference temperature. In [9],
    the interference is defined as the expected fraction of primary users with service
    disrupted by the xG operations. This method considers factors such as the type
    of unlicensed signal modulation, antennas, ability to detect active licensed channels,
    power control, and activity levels of the licensed and unlicensed users. However,
    this model describes the interference disrupted by a single xG user and does not
    consider the effect of multiple xG users. In addition, if xG users are unaware
    of the location of the nearby primary users, the actual interference cannot be
    measured using this method. In [63], a direct receiver detection method is presented,
    where the local oscillator (LO) leakage power emitted by the RF front-end of the
    primary receiver is exploited for the detection of primary receivers. In order
    to detect the LO leakage power, low-cost sensor nodes can be mounted close to
    the primary receivers. The sensor nodes detect the leakage LO power to determine
    the channel used by the primary receiver and this information is used by the unlicensed
    users to determine the operation spectrum. 4.4. Spectrum sensing challenges There
    exist several open research challenges that need to be investigated for the development
    of the spectrum sensing function. • Interference temperature measurement: The
    difficulty of this receiver detection model lies in effectively measuring the
    interference temperature. An xG user is naturally aware of its transmit power
    level and its precise location with the help of a positioning system. With this
    ability, however, its transmission could cause significant interference at a neighboring
    receiver on the same frequency. However, currently, there exists no practical
    way for a cognitive radio to measure or estimate the interference temperature
    at nearby primary receivers. Since primary receivers are usually passive devices,
    an xG user cannot be aware of the precise locations of primary receivers. Furthermore,
    if xG users cannot measure the effect of their transmission on all possible receivers,
    a useful interference temperature measurement may not be feasible. • Spectrum
    sensing in multi-user networks: Usually, xG networks reside in a multi-user environment
    which consists of multiple xG users and primary users. Furthermore, the xG networks
    can also be co-located with other xG networks competing for the same spectrum
    band. However, current interference models [9], [21] do not consider the effect
    of multiple xG users. Multi-user environment makes it more difficult to sense
    the primary users and to estimate the actual interference. Hence, spectrum sensing
    functions should be developed considering the possibility of multi-user/network
    environment. In order to solve the multi-user problem, the cooperative detection
    schemes can be considered, which exploit the spatial diversity inherent in a multi-user
    network. • Detection capability: One of the main requirements of xG networks is
    the detection of the primary users in a very short time [24], [53]. OFDM-based
    xG networks are known to be excellent fit for the physical architecture of xG
    networks [5], [57], [62]. Since multi-carrier sensing can be exploited in OFDM-based
    xG networks, the overall sensing time can be reduced. Once a primary user is detected
    in a single carrier, sensing in other carriers is not necessary. In [57], a power-based
    sensing algorithm in OFDM networks is proposed for detecting the presence of a
    primary user. It is shown that the overall detection time is reduced by collecting
    information from each carrier. However, this necessitates the use of a large number
    of carriers, which increases the design complexity. Hence, novel spectrum sensing
    algorithms need to be developed such that the number of samples needed to detect
    the primary user is minimized within a given detection error probability. 5. Spectrum
    management In xG networks, the unused spectrum bands will be spread over wide
    frequency range including both unlicensed and licensed bands. These unused spectrum
    bands detected through spectrum sensing show different characteristics according
    to not only the time varying radio environment but also the spectrum band information
    such as the operating frequency and the bandwidth. Since xG networks should decide
    on the best spectrum band to meet the QoS requirements over all available spectrum
    bands, new spectrum management functions are required for xG networks, considering
    the dynamic spectrum characteristics. We classify these functions as spectrum
    sensing, spectrum analysis, and spectrum decision. While spectrum sensing, which
    is discussed in Section 4, is primarily a PHY layer issue, spectrum analysis and
    spectrum decision are closely related to the upper layers. In this section, spectrum
    analysis and spectrum decision are investigated. 5.1. Spectrum analysis In xG
    networks, the available spectrum holes show different characteristics which vary
    over time. Since the xG users are equipped with the cognitive radio based physical
    layer, it is important to understand the characteristics of different spectrum
    bands. Spectrum analysis enables the characterization of different spectrum bands,
    which can be exploited to get the spectrum band appropriate to the user requirements.
    In order to describe the dynamic nature of xG networks, each spectrum hole should
    be characterized considering not only the time-varying radio environment and but
    also the primary user activity and the spectrum band information such as operating
    frequency and bandwidth. Hence, it is essential to define parameters such as interference
    level, channel error rate, path-loss, link layer delay, and holding time that
    can represent the quality of a particular spectrum band as follows: • Interference:
    Some spectrum bands are more crowded compared to others. Hence, the spectrum band
    in use determines the interference characteristics of the channel. From the amount
    of the interference at the primary receiver, the permissible power of an xG user
    can be derived, which is used for the estimation of the channel capacity. • Path
    loss: The path loss increases as the operating frequency increases. Therefore,
    if the transmission power of an xG user remains the same, then its transmission
    range decreases at higher frequencies. Similarly, if transmission power is increased
    to compensate for the increased path loss, then this results in higher interference
    for other users. • Wireless link errors: Depending on the modulation scheme and
    the interference level of the spectrum band, the error rate of the channel changes.
    • Link layer delay: To address different path loss, wireless link error, and interference,
    different types of link layer protocols are required at different spectrum bands.
    This results in different link layer packet transmission delay. • Holding time:
    The activities of primary users can affect the channel quality in xG networks.
    Holding time refers to the expected time duration that the xG user can occupy
    a licensed band before getting interrupted. Obviously, the longer the holding
    time, the better the quality would be. Since frequent spectrum handoff can decrease
    the holding time, previous statistical patterns of handoff should be considered
    while designing xG networks with large expected holding time. Channel capacity,
    which can be derived from the parameters explained above, is the most important
    factor for spectrum characterization. Usually SNR at the receiver has been used
    for the capacity estimation. However, since SNR considers only local observations
    of xG users, it is not enough to avoid interference at the primary users. Thus,
    spectrum characterization is focused on the capacity estimation based on the interference
    at the licensed receivers. The interference temperature model [21] given in Section
    4.3 can be exploited for this approach. The interference temperature limit indicates
    an upper bound or cap on the potential RF energy that could be introduced into
    the band. Consequently, using the amount of permissible interference, the maximum
    permissible transmission power of an xG user can be determined. In [63], a spectrum
    capacity estimation method has been proposed that considers the bandwidth and
    the permissible transmission power. Accordingly, the spectrum capacity, C, can
    be estimated as follows: (5) where B is the bandwidth, S is the received signal
    power from the xG user, N is the xG receiver noise power, and I is the interference
    power received at the xG receiver due to the primary transmitter. Estimating spectrum
    capacity has also been investigated in the context of OFDM-based cognitive radio
    systems in [57]. Accordingly, the spectrum capacity of the OFDM-based xG networks
    is defined as follows [57]: (6) where Ω is the collection of unused spectrum segments,
    G(f) is the channel power gain at frequency f, S0 and N0 are the signal and noise
    power per unit frequency, respectively. The recent work on spectrum analysis,
    as discussed above, only focuses on spectrum capacity estimation. However, besides
    the capacity, other factors such as delay, link error rate, and holding time also
    have significant influence on the quality of services. Moreover, the capacity
    is closely related to both interference level and path loss. However, a complete
    analysis and modeling of spectrum in xG networks is yet to be developed. In order
    to decide on the appropriate spectrum for different types of applications, it
    is desirable and an open research issue to identify the spectrum bands combining
    all characterization parameters described above. 5.2. Spectrum decision Once all
    available spectrum bands are characterized, appropriate operating spectrum band
    should be selected for the current transmission considering the QoS requirements
    and the spectrum characteristics. Thus, the spectrum management function must
    be aware of user QoS requirements. Based on the user requirements, the data rate,
    acceptable error rate, delay bound, the transmission mode, and the bandwidth of
    the transmission can be determined. Then, according to the decision rule, the
    set of appropriate spectrum bands can be chosen. In [73], five spectrum decision
    rules are presented, which are focused on fairness and communication cost. However,
    this method assumes that all channels have similar throughput capacity. In [36],
    an opportunistic frequency channel skipping protocol is proposed for the search
    of better quality channel, where this channel decision is based on SNR. In order
    to consider the primary user activity, the number of spectrum handoff, which happens
    in a certain spectrum band, is used for spectrum decision [37]. Spectrum decision
    constitutes rather important but yet unexplored issues in xG networks, which are
    presented in the following subsection. 5.3. Spectrum management challenges There
    exist several open research issues that need to be investigated for the development
    of spectrum decision function. • Decision model: Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is
    not sufficient to characterize the spectrum band in xG networks. Besides the SNR,
    many spectrum characterization parameters would affect the quality, as investigated
    in Section 5.1. Thus, how to combine these spectrum characterization parameters
    for the spectrum decision model is still an open issue. Moreover, in OFDM based
    xG networks, multiple spectrum bands can be simultaneously used for the transmission.
    For these reasons, a decision framework for the multiple spectrum bands should
    be provided. • Multiple spectrum band decision: In xG networks, multiple spectrum
    bands can be simultaneously used for the transmission. Moreover, the xG networks
    do not require the selected multiple bands to be contiguous. Thus, an xG user
    can send packets over non-contiguous spectrum bands. This multi-spectrum transmission
    shows less quality degradation during the spectrum handoff compared to the conventional
    transmission on single spectrum band [5]. For example, if a primary user appears
    in a particular spectrum band, the xG user has to vacate this band. However, since
    the rest of spectrum bands will maintain the communication, abrupt service quality
    degradation can be mitigated. In addition, transmission in multiple spectrum bands
    allows lower power to be used in each spectrum band. As a result, less interference
    with primary users is achieved, compared to the transmission on single spectrum
    band [5]. For these reasons, a spectrum management framework should support multiple
    spectrum decision capabilities. For example, how to determine the number of spectrum
    bands and how to select the set of appropriate bands are still open research issues
    in xG networks. • Cooperation with reconfiguration: The cognitive radio technology
    enables the transmission parameters of a radio to be reconfigured for optimal
    operation in a certain spectrum band. For example, if SNR is fixed, the bit error
    rate (BER) can be adjusted to maintain the channel capacity by exploiting adaptive
    modulation techniques, e.g., cdma2000 1x EVDO [1], [18]. Hence, a cooperative
    framework that considers both spectrum decision and reconfiguration is required.
    • Spectrum decision over heterogenous spectrum bands: Currently, certain spectrum
    bands are already assigned to different purposes while some bands remain unlicensed.
    Thus, the spectrum used by xG networks will most likely be a combination of exclusively
    accessed spectrum and unlicensed spectrum. In case of licensed bands, the xG users
    need to consider the activities of primary users in spectrum analysis and decision
    in order not to influence the primary user transmission. Conversely, in unlicensed
    bands, since all the xG users have the same spectrum access rights, sophisticated
    spectrum sharing techniques are necessary. In order to decide the best spectrum
    band over this heterogeneous environment, xG network should support spectrum decision
    operations on both the licensed and the unlicensed bands considering these different
    characteristics. 6. Spectrum mobility xG networks target to use the spectrum in
    a dynamic manner by allowing the radio terminals, known as the cognitive radio,
    to operate in the best available frequency band. This enables “Get the Best Available
    Channel” concept for communication purposes. To realize the “Get the Best Available
    Channel” concept, an xG radio has to capture the best available spectrum. Spectrum
    mobility is defined as the process when an xG user changes its frequency of operation.
    In the following sections, we describe the spectrum handoff concept in xG networks
    and discuss open research issues in this new area. 6.1. Spectrum handoff In xG
    networks, spectrum mobility arises when current channel conditions become worse
    or a primary user appears. Spectrum mobility gives rise to a new type of handoff
    in xG networks that we refer to as spectrum handoff. The protocols for different
    layers of the network stack must adapt to the channel parameters of the operating
    frequency. Moreover, they should be transparent to the spectrum handoff and the
    associated latency. As pointed out in earlier sections, a cognitive radio can
    adapt to the frequency of operation. Therefore, each time an xG user changes its
    frequency of operation, the network protocols are going to shift from one mode
    of operation to another. The purpose of spectrum mobility management in xG networks
    is to make sure that such transitions are made smoothly and as soon as possible
    such that the applications running on an xG user perceive minimum performance
    degradation during a spectrum handoff. It is essential for the mobility management
    protocols to learn in advance about the duration of a spectrum handoff. This information
    should be provided by the sensing algorithm. Once the mobility management protocols
    learn about this latency, their job is to make sure that the ongoing communications
    of an xG user undergo only minimum performance degradation. Consequently, multi-layer
    mobility management protocols are required to accomplish the spectrum mobility
    functionalities. These protocols support mobility management adaptive to different
    types of applications. For example, a TCP connection can be put to a wait state
    until the spectrum handoff is over. Moreover, since the TCP parameters will change
    after a spectrum handoff, it is essential to learn the new parameters and ensure
    that the transition from the old parameters to new parameters are carried out
    rapidly. For a data communication e.g., FTP, the mobility management protocols
    should implement mechanisms to store the packets that are transmitted during a
    spectrum handoff, whereas for a real-time application there is no need to store
    the packets as the stored packets, if delivered later, will be stale packets and
    can not be used by the corresponding application. 6.2. Spectrum mobility challenges
    in xG networks The followings are the open research issues for efficient spectrum
    mobility in xG networks. • At a particular time, several frequency bands may be
    available for an xG user. Algorithms are required to decide the best available
    spectrum based on the channel characteristics of the available spectrum and the
    requirements of the applications that are being used by an xG user. • Once, the
    best available spectrum is selected, the next challenge is to design new mobility
    and connection management approaches to reduce delay and loss during spectrum
    handoff. • When the current operational frequency becomes busy (this may happen
    if a licensed user starts to use this frequency) in the middle of a communication
    by an xG user, then applications running on this node have to be transferred to
    another available frequency band. However, the selection of new operational frequency
    may take time. Novel algorithms are required to ensure that applications do not
    suffer from severe performance degradation during such transitions. • Spectrum
    handoff may occur due to reasons other than the detection of the primary user.
    Thus, there exist various other spectrum handoff schemes in xG networks. If an
    xG user moves from one place to another, spectrum handoff may occur just because
    the available spectrum bands change. Thus the desired spectrum handoff scheme
    should integrate inter-cell handoff. Apart from this, spectrum handoff between
    different networks, referred to as vertical handoff is also likely to occur in
    xG networks. Under such a diverse environment, it is essential that spectrum handoff
    scheme takes all the above mentioned possibilities into consideration. • Spectrum
    mobility in time domain: xG networks adapt to the wireless spectrum based on available
    bands on the spectrum. Since these available channels change over time, enabling
    QoS in this environment is challenging. The physical radio should “move” through
    the spectrum to meet the QoS requirements. • Spectrum mobility in space: The available
    bands also change as a user moves from one place to another. Hence, continuous
    allocation of spectrum is a major challenge. in xG networks. 7. Spectrum sharing
    In xG networks, one of the main challenges in open spectrum usage is the spectrum
    sharing. Spectrum sharing can be regarded to be similar to generic medium access
    control (MAC) problems in existing systems. However, as we will investigate in
    this section, substantially different challenges exist for spectrum sharing in
    xG networks. The coexistence with licensed users and the wide range of available
    spectrum are two of the main reasons for these unique challenges. In this section,
    we delve into the specific challenges for spectrum sharing in xG networks, overview
    the existing solutions and discuss open research areas. In order to provide a
    directory for different challenges during spectrum sharing, we first enumerate
    the steps in spectrum sharing in xG networks. The challenges and the solutions
    proposed for these steps will then be explained in detail. The spectrum sharing
    process consists of five major steps. 1. Spectrum sensing: An xG user can only
    allocate a portion of the spectrum if that portion is not used by an unlicensed
    user. In Section 4, the solutions and the challenges for this problem, i.e., spectrum
    sensing, are described. Accordingly, when an xG node aims to transmit packets,
    it first needs to be aware of the spectrum usage around its vicinity. 2. Spectrum
    allocation: Based on the spectrum availability, the node can then allocate a channel.
    This allocation not only depends on spectrum availability, but it is also determined
    based on internal (and possibly external) policies. Hence, the design of a spectrum
    allocation policy to improve the performance of a node is an important research
    topic. 3. Spectrum access: In this step, another major problem of spectrum sharing
    comes into picture. Since there may be multiple xG nodes trying to access the
    spectrum, this access should also be coordinated in order to prevent multiple
    users colliding in overlapping portions of the spectrum. 4. Transmitter-receiver
    handshake: Once a portion of the spectrum is determined for communication, the
    receiver of this communication should also be indicated about the selected spectrum.
    Hence, a transmitter-receiver handshake protocol is essential for efficient communication
    in xG networks. Note that the term handshake by no means restricts this protocol
    between the transmitter and the receiver. A third party such as a centralized
    station can also be involved. 5. Spectrum mobility: xG nodes are regarded as “visitors”
    to the spectrum they allocate. Hence, if the specific portion of the spectrum
    in use is required by a licensed user, the communication needs to be continued
    in another vacant portion. As a result, spectrum mobility is also important for
    successful communication between xG nodes. The existing work in spectrum sharing
    in xG networks aims to provide solutions for each step explained above. The existing
    solutions constitute a rich literature for spectrum sharing in xG networks. In
    Section 7.1, we classify the spectrum sharing techniques and describe the fundamental
    results about these techniques in xG networks. These work provide insight about
    how a spectrum sharing protocol can be designed. Accordingly, in Sections 7.2
    Inter-network spectrum sharing, 7.3 Intra-network spectrum sharing, we overview
    the solutions for spectrum sharing among multiple coexisting xG networks (inter-network
    spectrum sharing), and inside an xG network (intra-network spectrum sharing),
    respectively. Finally, in Section 7.4, the open research issues for spectrum sharing
    in xG networks are discussed. 7.1. Overview of spectrum sharing techniques The
    existing solutions for spectrum sharing in xG networks can be mainly classified
    in three aspects: i.e., according to their architecture assumption, spectrum allocation
    behavior, and spectrum access technique as shown in Fig. 12. In this section,
    we describe these three classifications and present the fundamental results that
    analyze these classifications. The analysis of xG spectrum sharing techniques
    has been investigated through two major theoretical approaches. While some work
    uses optimization techniques to find the optimal strategies for spectrum sharing,
    game theoretical analysis has also been used in this area. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. Classification of spectrum sharing in xG networks based
    on architecture, spectrum allocation behavior, and spectrum access technique.
    The first classification for spectrum sharing techniques in xG networks is based
    on the architecture, which can be described as follows: • Centralized spectrum
    sharing: In these solutions, a centralized entity controls the spectrum allocation
    and access procedures [7], [51], [70]. With aid to these procedures, generally,
    a distributed sensing procedure is proposed such that each entity in the xG network
    forward their measurements about the spectrum allocation to the central entity
    and this entity constructs a spectrum allocation map. • Distributed spectrum sharing:
    Distributed solutions are mainly proposed for cases where the construction of
    an infrastructure is not preferable [15], [29], [40], [54], [71], [72], [73].
    Accordingly, each node is responsible for the spectrum allocation and access is
    based on local (or possibly global) policies. The second classification for spectrum
    sharing techniques in xG networks is based on the access behavior. More specifically,
    the spectrum access can be cooperative or non-cooperative as explained below:
    • Cooperative spectrum sharing: Cooperative (or collaborative) solutions consider
    the effect of the node’s communication on other nodes [7], [15], [29], [40], [71].
    In other words, the interference measurements of each node are shared among other
    nodes. Furthermore, the spectrum allocation algorithms also consider this information.
    While all the centralized solutions can be regarded as cooperative, there also
    exist distributed cooperative solutions. • Non-cooperative spectrum sharing: Contrary
    to the cooperative solutions, non-cooperative (or non-collaborative, selfish)
    solutions consider only the node at hand [54], [72], [73]. These solutions are
    also referred to as selfish. While non-cooperative solutions may result in reduced
    spectrum utilization, the minimal communication requirements among other nodes
    introduce a tradeoff for practical solutions. These two solutions have generally
    been compared through their spectrum utilization, fairness, and throughput. The
    utilization and fairness in spectrum access has been investigated in [50], where
    the spectrum allocation problem is modeled as a graph coloring problem and both
    centralized and distributed approaches are investigated. Using this model, an
    optimization framework is developed. In this framework, secondary users allocate
    channels according to the interference that will be caused by the transmission.
    Both cooperative and non-cooperative approaches are considered such that cooperative
    approaches also consider the effect of the channel allocation on the potential
    neighbors. The simulation results show that cooperative approaches outperform
    non-cooperative approaches as well as closely approximating the global optimum.
    Moreover, the comparison of centralized and distributed solutions reveals that
    distributed solution closely follows the centralized solution. A similar analysis
    has also been provided in [74], where the effects of collaboration in spectrum
    access is investigated. An important assumption in these work is that secondary
    users know the location and transmit power of primary users so that the interference
    calculations can be performed easily. However, such an assumption may not always
    be valid in xG networks. Game theory has also been exploited for performance evaluation
    of xG spectrum access schemes. Especially, the comparison between cooperative
    and non-cooperative approaches has been presented in [49] through game theoretical
    analysis. In [49], game theory is exploited to analyze the behavior of the cognitive
    radio for distributed adaptive channel allocation. It is assumed that users deploy
    CDMA and determine the operating channel and the coding rate by keeping transmission
    power constant. It is shown that the cooperative case can be modeled as an exact
    potential game, which converges to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium solution.
    However, this framework has been shown not to be applicable for non-cooperative
    spectrum sharing and a learning algorithm has been proposed. The evaluations reveal
    that Nash equilibrium point for cooperative users is reached quickly and results
    in a certain degree of fairness as well as improved throughput. On the other hand,
    the learning algorithm for non-cooperative users converge to a mixed strategy
    allocation. Moreover, the fairness is degraded when non-cooperative approach is
    used. While this approach results in slightly worse performance, the information
    exchange required by selfish users is significantly low. Finally, the third classification
    for spectrum sharing in xG networks is based on the access technology as explained
    below: • Overlay spectrum sharing: Overlay spectrum sharing refers to the spectrum
    access technique used. More specifically, a node accesses the network using a
    portion of the spectrum that has not been used by licensed users [7], [15], [40],
    [54], [71], [72], [73]. As a result, interference to the primary system is minimized.
    • Underlay spectrum sharing: Underlay spectrum sharing exploits the spread spectrum
    techniques developed for cellular networks [29]. Once a spectrum allocation map
    has been acquired, an xG node begins transmission such that its transmit power
    at a certain portion of the spectrum is regarded as noise by the licensed users.
    This technique requires sophisticated spread spectrum techniques and can utilize
    increased bandwidth compared to overlay techniques. The effects of underlay and
    overlay approaches in a cooperative setting are investigated in [19], where non-cooperative
    users are analyzed using a game theoretical framework. Using this framework, it
    is shown that frequency division multiplexing is optimal when interference among
    users is high. As a result, the overlay approach becomes more efficient than underlay
    when interference among users is high. The lack of cooperation among users, however,
    necessitates an overlay approach. The comparative evaluations show that the performance
    loss due to the lack of cooperation is small, and vanishes with increasing SNR.
    However, in this framework, the cost and inaccuracies of information exchange
    between users are not considered. Another comparison of underlay and overlay approaches
    is provided in [42]. The comparison is based on the influence of the secondary
    system on the primary system in terms of outage probability and three spectrum
    sharing techniques have been considered. The first technique (spreading based
    underlay) requires secondary users to spread their transmit power over the full
    spectrum such as CDMA or Ultra Wide Band (UWB). The second technique (interference
    avoidance overlay) requires nodes to choose a frequency band to transmit such
    that the interference at a primary user is minimized. Also an hybrid technique
    (spreading based underlay with interference avoidance) is investigated where a
    node spreads its transmission over the entire spectrum and also null or notch
    frequencies where a primary user is transmitting. Consequently, first, the interference
    statistics for each technique are determined for outage probability analysis.
    Then, the outage probability for each technique is derived assuming no system
    knowledge, perfect system knowledge, and limited system knowledge. Similar to
    other existing work, when perfect system knowledge is assumed, the overlay scheme
    outperforms the underlay scheme in terms of outage probability. However, when
    interference avoidance is incorporated into spectrum sharing, the underlay scheme
    with interference avoidance guarantees smaller outage probability than the pure
    interference avoidance. In a more realistic case, when limited system knowledge
    is considered, the importance of the hybrid technique is exacerbated. The overlay
    schemes result in poor performance due imperfections at spectrum sensing. More
    specifically, a node can transmit at a channel where a primary user is transmitting.
    However, when underlay with interference avoidance is used, the interference caused
    to the primary user is minimized. Another important result is that a higher number
    of secondary users can be accommodated by the hybrid scheme than the pure interference
    avoidance scheme. The theoretical work on spectrum access in xG networks reveals
    important tradeoffs for the design of spectrum access protocols. As expected,
    it has been shown that cooperative settings result in higher utilization of the
    spectrum as well as fairness. However, this advantage may not be so high considering
    the cost of cooperation due to frequent information exchange among users. On the
    other hand, the spectrum access technique, i.e., whether it is overlay or underlay,
    affects the performance in each setting. While an overlay technique focuses on
    the holes in the spectrum, dynamic spreading techniques are required for underlay
    techniques for interference-free operation between primary and secondary systems.
    Considering the tradeoff between system complexity and performance, hybrid techniques
    may be considered for the spectrum technique. In the following two sections, we
    explain the existing spectrum sharing techniques that are combinations of the
    three classifications we have discussed in this section. 7.2. Inter-network spectrum
    sharing xG networks are envisioned to provide opportunistic access to the licensed
    spectrum using unlicensed users. This setting enables multiple systems being deployed
    in overlapping locations and spectrum as shown in Fig. 13. Hence, spectrum sharing
    among these systems is an important research topic in xG networks. Up to date,
    inter-network spectrum sharing has been regulated via static frequency assignment
    among different systems or centralized allocations between different access points
    of a system in cellular networks. In ad-hoc networks, only the interference issues
    in the ISM band has been investigated focusing mostly on the coexistence of WLAN
    and Bluetooth networks. Consequently, intra-network spectrum sharing in xG networks
    poses unique challenges that have not been considered before in wireless communication
    systems. In this section, we overview the recent work in this research area. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Inter-network and intra-network spectrum sharing
    in xG networks. 7.2.1. Centralized inter-network spectrum sharing As a first step
    for the coexistence of open spectrum systems, in [33], the common spectrum coordination
    channel (CSCC) etiquette protocol is proposed for coexistence of IEEE 802.11b
    and 802.16a networks. The reason we do not consider this work as a complete solution
    for xG networks is that it necessitates modifications in users using both of the
    networks. More specifically, each node is assumed to be equipped with a cognitive
    radio and a low bit-rate, narrow-band control radio. The coexistence is maintained
    through the coordination of these nodes with each other by broadcasting CSCC messages.
    Each user determines the channel it can use for data transmission such that interference
    is avoided. In case channel selection is not sufficient to avoid interference,
    power adaptation is also deployed. The evaluations reveal that when there is vacant
    spectrum to use frequency adaptation, CSCC etiquette protocol improves throughput
    by 35–160% via both frequency and power adaptation. Another interesting result
    is that when nodes are clustered around IEEE 802.11b access points, which is a
    realistic assumption, the throughput improvement of CSCC protocol increases. In
    addition to the competition for the spectrum, competition for the users is also
    considered in [32]. In this work, a central spectrum policy server (SPS) is proposed
    to coordinate spectrum demands of multiple xG operators. In this scheme, each
    operator bids for the spectrum indicating the cost it will pay for the duration
    of the usage. The SPS then allocates the spectrum by maximizing its profit from
    these bids. The operators also determine an offer for the users and users select
    which operator to use for a given type of traffic. When compared to a case where
    each operator is assigned an equal share of the spectrum, the operator bidding
    scheme achieves higher throughput leading to higher revenue for the SPS, as well
    as a lower price for the users according to their requirements. This work opens
    a new perspective by incorporating competition for users as well as the spectrum
    in xG networks. 7.2.2. Distributed inter-network spectrum sharing A distributed
    spectrum sharing scheme for wireless Internet service provides (WISPs) that share
    the same spectrum is proposed in [43], where a distributed QoS based dynamic channel
    reservation (D-QDCR) scheme is used. The basic concept behind D-QDCR is that a
    base station (BSs) of a WISP competes with its interferer BSs according to the
    QoS requirements of its users to allocate a portion of the spectrum. Similar to
    the CSCC protocol [33], the control and data channels are separated. The basic
    unit for channel allocation in D-QDCR is called Q-frames. When a BS allocates
    a Q-frame, it uses the control and data channels allocated to it for coordination
    and data communication between the users. The competition between BSs are performed
    according to the priority of each BS depending on a BSs data volume and QoS requirement.
    Moreover, various competition policies are proposed based on the type of traffic
    a user demands. Although thorough evaluations are not provided in [43], the D-QDCR
    scheme serves an important contribution for inter-network spectrum sharing. The
    inter-network spectrum sharing solutions so far provide a broader view of the
    spectrum sharing solution including certain operator policies for the determination
    of the spectrum allocation. A major problem for the existing solutions in the
    xG network architecture is the requirement for a common control channel. We detail
    the potential problems and open research issues in this aspect in Section 7.4.
    7.3. Intra-network spectrum sharing A significant amount of work on spectrum sharing
    focuses on intra-network spectrum sharing, where the users of an xG network try
    to access the available spectrum without causing interference to the primary users.
    In this section, we overview the existing work and the proposed solutions in this
    area while providing a classification of existing protocols in terms of the classification
    provided in Section 7.1. 7.3.1. Cooperative intra-network spectrum sharing A cooperative
    local bargaining (LB) scheme is proposed in [15] to provide both spectrum utilization
    and fairness. The local bargaining framework is formulated based on the framework
    in [50], [74]. Local bargaining is performed by constructing local groups according
    to a poverty line that ensures a minimum spectrum allocation to each user and
    hence focuses on fairness of users. The evaluations reveal that local bargaining
    can closely approximate centralized graph coloring approach at a reduced complexity.
    Moreover, localized operation via grouping provides an efficient operation between
    a fully distributed and a centralized scheme. Another approach that considers
    local groups for spectrum sharing is provided in [71], where a heterogeneous distributed
    MAC (HD-MAC) protocol is proposed. A potential problem in the solution provided
    in LB [15] is that a common control channel may not exist in xG networks or can
    be occupied by a primary user. In [71], it is shown that for a given topology,
    very limited number of common channels exist for each of the users in a network.
    However, when local neighbors are considered, a node shares many channels with
    its neighbors. Based on this observation, a clustering algorithm is proposed such
    that each group selects a common channel for communication, and distributed sensing
    and spectrum sharing is provided through this channel. Moreover, if this channel
    is occupied by a primary user at a specific time, the nodes reorganize themselves
    to use another control channel. The performance evaluations show that the distributed
    grouping approach outperforms common control channel approaches especially when
    the traffic load is high. The notion of busy tones, which are mainly used in some
    ad-hoc network protocols, is extended to the xG networks in [40] with the dynamic
    open spectrum sharing MAC (DOSS-MAC) protocol. As a result, when a node is using
    a specific data channel for communication, both the transmitter and the receiver
    send a busy tone signal through the associated busy tone channel. In order to
    further eliminate control channel communication, FFT-based radio and the noncoherent
    modulation/demodulation-based radio designs are proposed which theoretically enable
    receivers to detect the carrier frequency and the bandwidth of a signal without
    any control information. In addition to spectrum allocation, transmit power determination
    is also included in the spectrum sharing protocol in [29]. In this work both single
    channel and multi-channel asynchronous distributed pricing (SC/MC-ADP) schemes
    are proposed, where each node announces its interference price to other nodes.
    Using this information from its neighbors, a node can first allocate a channel
    and in case there exist users in that channel, then, determine its transmit power.
    As a result, this scheme can be classified as a hybrid of underlay and overlay
    techniques. While there exist users using distinct channels, multiple users can
    share the same channel by adjusting their transmit power. Furthermore, the SC-ADP
    algorithm provides higher rates to users when compared to selfish algorithms where
    users select the best channel without any knowledge about their neighbors’ interference
    levels. Finally, it is shown that under high interference, the proposed algorithm
    outperforms underlay techniques. So far, we have presented distributed solutions
    where a fixed infrastructure is not assumed. In [7], dynamic spectrum access protocol
    (DSAP), which is a centralized solution for spectrum sharing in xG networks, is
    presented. This solution is similar to the SPS approach [32] described in Section
    7.2 with a focus on intra-network spectrum sharing. The dynamic spectrum access
    protocol (DSAP) proposed in this work enables a central entity to lease spectrum
    to users in a limited geographical region. DSAP consists of clients, DSAP server,
    and relays that relay information between server and clients that are not in the
    direct range of the server. Moreover, clients inform the server their channel
    conditions so that a global view of the network can be constructed at the server.
    By exploiting cooperative and distributed sensing, DSAP servers construct a RadioMap.
    This map is used for channel assignments which are leased to clients for a limited
    amount of time. 7.3.2. Non-cooperative intra-network spectrum sharing An opportunistic
    spectrum management scheme is proposed in [73], where users allocate channels
    based on their observations of interference patterns and neighbors. In the device
    centric spectrum management scheme (DCSM), the communication overhead is minimized
    by providing five different system rules for spectrum allocation. As a result,
    users allocate channels according to these rules based on their observations instead
    of collaborating with other users. In case more than one node chooses the same
    channel in close proximity, random access techniques are used to resolve the contention.
    The comparative analysis of this scheme with the cooperative schemes show that
    rule-based spectrum access results in slightly worse performance. However, the
    communication overhead is reduced significantly. A spectrum sharing protocol for
    ad-hoc xG networks, (AS-MAC), is proposed in [54]. AS-MAC exploits the RTS-CTS
    exchange and Network Allocation Vector (NAV) concepts of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol
    [30] in an open spectrum setting. Moreover, a common control channel is used such
    that transmitter receiver handshake is initiated through this channel. In this
    work, the xG network is assumed to coexist with a GSM network. Each node first
    listens to the broadcast channel of the GSM network as well as the control channel
    of the xG network, and each node then constructs its NAV and selects channels
    accordingly. In addition to the spectrum allocation methods, a transmitter receiver
    handshake method is proposed in [72] as a part of a cross-layer decentralized
    cognitive MAC (DC-MAC) protocol. The details of this work is explained in Section
    9. In the transmitter-receiver handshake method, each user is assigned a set of
    channels is continuously monitored by the user. A transmitter selects one of those
    channels and initiates communication. The actual data channel selection is then
    performed through this initial handshake channel. 7.4. Spectrum sharing challenges
    In the previous sections, the theoretical findings and solutions for spectrum
    sharing in xG networks are investigated. Although there already exists a vast
    amount of research in spectrum sharing, there are still many open research issues
    for the realization of efficient and seamless open spectrum operation. In the
    following, we detail the challenges for spectrum sharing in xG networks along
    with some possible solutions. 7.4.1. Common control channel (CCC) Many spectrum
    sharing solutions, either centralized or distributed, assume a CCC for spectrum
    sharing [7], [40], [54]. It is clear that a CCC facilitates many spectrum sharing
    functionalities such as transmitter receiver handshake [40], communication with
    a central entity [7], or sensing information exchange. However, due to the fact
    that xG network users are regarded as visitors to the spectrum they allocate,
    when a primary user chooses a channel, this channel has to be vacated without
    interfering. This is also true for the CCC. As a result, implementation of a fixed
    CCC is infeasible in xG networks. Moreover, in a network with primary users, a
    channel common for all users is shown to be highly dependent on the topology,
    hence, varies over time [71]. Consequently, for protocols requiring a CCC, either
    a CCC mitigation technique needs to be devised or local CCCs need to be exploited
    for clusters of nodes [71]. On the other hand when CCC is not used, the transmitter
    receiver handshake becomes a challenge. For this challenge, receiver driven techniques
    proposed in [72] may be exploited. 7.4.2. Dynamic radio range Radio range changes
    with operating frequency due to attenuation variation. In many solutions, a fixed
    range is assumed to be independent of the operating spectrum [15], [71]. However,
    in xG networks, where a large portion of the wireless spectrum is considered,
    the neighbors of a node may change as the operating frequency changes. This effects
    the interference profile as well as routing decisions. Moreover, due to this property,
    the choice of a control channel needs to be carefully decided. It would be much
    efficient to select control channels in the lower portions of the spectrum where
    the transmission range will be higher and to select data channels in the higher
    portions of the spectrum where a localized operation can be utilized with minimized
    interference. So far, there exists no work addressing this important challenge
    in xG networks and we advocate operation frequency aware spectrum sharing techniques
    due the direct interdependency between interference and radio range. 7.4.3. Spectrum
    unit Almost all spectrum sharing techniques discussed in the previous sections
    consider a channel as the basic spectrum unit for operation. Many algorithms and
    methods have been proposed to select the suitable channel for efficient operation
    in xG networks. However, in some work, the channel is vaguely defined as “orthogonal
    non-interfering” [73], “TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, or a combination of them” [50], or “a
    physical channel as in IEEE 802.11, or a logical channel associated with a spectrum
    region or a radio technology” [71]. In other work, the channel is simply defined
    in the frequency dimension as frequency bands [33], [40], [43], [49], [54]. It
    is clear that the definition of a channel as a spectrum unit for spectrum sharing
    is crucial in further developing algorithms. Since a huge portion of the spectrum
    is of interest, it is clear that properties of a channel may not be constant due
    to the effects of operating frequency. On the contrary, a channel is usually assumed
    to provide the same bandwidth as other channels [15], [29], [42], [50], [73].
    Furthermore, the existence of primary users and the heterogeneity of the networks
    that are available introduce additional challenges to the choice of a spectrum
    unit/channel. Hence, different resource allocation units such as CSMA random access,
    TDMA time slots, CDMA codes, as well as hybrid types can be allocated to the primary
    users. In order to provide seamless operation, these properties need to be considered
    in the choice of a spectrum unit. In [28], the necessity of a spectrum space for
    a spectrum unit is also advocated. The possible dimensions of the spectrum space
    are classified as power, frequency, time, space, and signal. Although not orthogonal,
    these dimensions can be used to distinguish signals [28]. For this purpose, we
    describe a three dimensional space model for modeling network resources that has
    been proposed in [59]. Although this work focuses on heterogeneity in next generation/fourth
    generation (NG/4G) networks, as discussed in [59], it can be easily incorporated
    into xG networks. Based on this three dimensional resource-space, a novel Virtual
    Cube concept has been proposed in order to evaluate the performance of each network.
    The Virtual Cube concept defines a unit structure based on the resource allocation
    techniques used in existing networks. The resource is modeled in a three dimensional
    resource-space with time, rate, and power/code dimensions as shown in Fig. 14.
    The time dimension models the time required to transfer information. The rate
    dimension models the data rate of the network. Thus, the capacity of different
    networks with the same connection durations but different data rates are captured
    in the rate dimension. Furthermore, in the case of CDMA networks, the bandwidth
    increase due to the multi-code transmissions is also captured in this dimension.
    The power/code dimension models the energy consumed for transmitting information
    through the network. Note that, the resource in terms of available bandwidth can
    be modeled using the time and rate dimensions. However, the cost of accessing
    different networks vary in terms of the power consumed by the wireless terminal.
    Hence, a third dimension is required. Each network type requires different power
    levels for transmission of the MAC frames because of various modulation schemes,
    error coding and channel coding techniques. As a result, the resource differences
    in these aspects are captured in the power dimension. Download : Download full-size

    in existing networks as well as xG network spectrum can be modeled based on a
    generic spectrum unit. We advocate that determining a common spectrum unit is
    crucial for efficient utilization of the wireless spectrum and seamless operability
    with existing primary networks. 8. Upper layer issues In addition to the unique
    challenges of xG networks in terms of spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum
    mobility, and spectrum sharing, upper layer issues such as routing, flow control
    and congestion control are also important for the realization of dynamic spectrum
    networks. In this section, we overview the challenges related to these areas.
    8.1. Routing challenges Routing constitutes a rather important but yet unexplored
    problem in xG networks. Especially in xG networks with multi-hop communication
    requirements, the unique characteristics of the open spectrum phenomenon necessitates
    novel routing algorithms to be developed. So far, the research on xG networks
    is primarily on spectrum sensing techniques and spectrum sharing solutions. However,
    we emphasize that the need for routing algorithms in open spectrum environment
    constitutes an important topic in xG network research. In this section, we overview
    two existing solutions for routing and discuss open research topics in this area.
    A major design choice for routing in xG networks is the collaboration between
    routing and spectrum management. The dynamic spectrum that is intermittent in
    terms of both time and space necessitates such an approach [60], [69]. Simulation-based
    comparisons are performed in [60], [69] for cross-layer and decoupled approaches
    for routing and spectrum management. The results in both of these work reveal
    that a cross-layer solution that constructs routes and determines the operating
    spectrum jointly for each hop outperforms a sequential approach where routes are
    selected independent of the spectrum allocation [60], [69]. In [60], the inter-dependence
    between route selection and spectrum management is investigated. First, a decoupled
    route selection and spectrum management methodology is proposed. In this scheme,
    the route selection is performed independent of the spectrum management using
    the shortest-path algorithm. The spectrum sharing is performed using the scheme
    in [71]. In this scheme, routing layer invokes path discovery to select routes.
    The spectrum management is then performed on each hop. A cross-layer solution
    that considers joint route selection and spectrum management is also proposed.
    In this approach, each source node uses DSR to find candidate paths and schedules
    a time and channel for each hop. This source-based routing technique is performed
    centrally using a global view of the network to show the upper bound in achievable
    performance. A similar comparison of layered and cross-layer approach is presented
    in [69] using a novel graph modeling technique, which will be discussed in the
    following. The simulations in both [60], [69] reveal that cross-layer approach
    is advantageous for routing in xG networks since the availability of spectrum
    directly affects the end-to-end performance. These two solutions for routing in
    xG networks clearly show that cross-layer approaches that jointly consider route
    and spectrum selection is necessary for xG networks. Another unique challenge
    for routing in xG networks is the development tools for analytical evaluation
    of routing protocols. Traditionally, routing protocols for ad hoc networks are
    analyzed using graph models. However, in these networks, the communication spectrum
    is fixed and continuous contrary to the dynamic nature of xG networks. Hence,
    a node can use the same set of static channel(s) for communication with all neighbors
    [69]. On the contrary, modeling network topology and connectivity of an xG network
    is challenging. In [69], a layered graph model is proposed for this challenge.
    In this model, each layer corresponds to a channel in the network. In each layer,
    each node is represented by subnodes forming the vertex in each layer. This model
    is exploited in [69] to construct routes. Using different cost functions for each
    edge, required constraints for routes such as interference avoidance can be achieved.
    This model provides an interesting solution for xG network modeling for relatively
    static link properties. However, as will be discussed in the following, time-varying
    nature of available links necessitates time dependent models for a complete analysis
    of xG networks. Although these solutions provide interesting results for routing
    in xG networks, there are still major challenges and open research topics that
    has not been addressed before. Below, we summarize the open research issues for
    routing in xG networks: • Common control channel: It has also been emphasized
    in Section 7.4 that the lack of a common control channel (CCC) in xG networks
    constitutes a major problem. Traditional routing protocols require either local
    or global broadcast messages for specific functionalities such as neighbor discovery,
    route discovery and route establishment. However, even broadcasting in xG networks
    is a major problem due to the lack of a CCC. Hence, solutions considering this
    fact is required in xG networks. • Intermittent connectivity: In xG networks,
    the reachable neighbors of a node may change rapidly. This is due to two reasons.
    First, the available spectrum may change or vanish as licensed users exploit the
    network. Moreover, once a node selects a channel for communication it is no longer
    reachable through other channels. As a result, the connectivity concept used for
    wireless networks is different in xG networks and depends on the spectrum. For
    this purpose channel-based models such as the one in [69] is required as well
    as time-based solutions. • Re-routing: In xG networks, due to the intermittent
    connectivity, a route established for a flow can change due to the available spectrum
    in addition to mobility. Hence, the re-routing algorithms considering the dynamic
    spectrum is necessary for routing in xG networks. A spectrum-aware routing adapts
    route selection to spectrum fluctuations [73]. • Queue management: The queue management
    in xG networks is another challenge which has not been addressed to date. An xG
    terminal may have multiple interfaces for communication with different nodes.
    Since the available spectrum varies over time, these interfaces may become unavailable
    requiring the packets served through that interface moved to other interfaces.
    In addition, the quality of service requirements may deploy various priorities
    on different traffic types. Hence, the implementation of a single queue or multiple
    queues for each traffic type of each interface needs to be investigated. 8.2.
    Transport layer challenges Transport protocols constitute an unexplored area for
    xG networks since there exist no work on this area yet. Several solutions have
    been proposed to improve the performance of TCP and UDP in conventional wireless
    networks in recent years [2]. These studies focus on mechanisms to limit the performance
    degradation of TCP and UDP that arise because of wireless link errors and access
    delays. However, the xG networks impose unique challenges for transport protocols
    as explained below: The performance of TCP depends on the packet loss probability
    and the round trip time (RTT). Wireless link errors and, hence, the packet loss
    probability not only depends on the access technology, but also on the frequency
    in use, interference level, and the available bandwidth. Therefore, the wireless
    TCP and UDP protocols that are designed for existing wireless access technologies
    cannot be used in dynamic spectrum assignment based xG networks. On the other
    hand, RTT of a TCP connection depends indirectly on the frequency of operation.
    For example, if the packet error rate (or equivalently, the frame error rate)
    is higher at a particular frequency band, a higher number of link layer retransmissions
    are required to successfully transport a packet across the wireless channel. Moreover,
    the wireless channel access delay in xG networks depends on the operation frequency,
    the interference level, and the medium access control protocol. These factors
    influence the RTT of a TCP connection. Therefore, based on the frequency of operation,
    RTT and packet loss probability observed by a TCP protocol will vary. Hence, transport
    protocols need to be designed to adapt to these variations. The operation frequency
    of a cognitive radio in xG networks may vary from time to time due to spectrum
    handoff as explained in Section 6. When an xG terminal changes its operating frequency,
    this results in a finite amount of delay before the new frequency can be operational.
    This is referred to as the spectrum handoff latency. The spectrum handoff latency
    can increase the RTT, which leads to retransmission timeout (RTO). Conventional
    transport protocols can perceive this RTO as packet loss and invoke its congestion
    avoidance mechanism resulting in reduced throughput. To eliminate the adverse
    effects of spectrum mobility, transport protocols need to be designed such that
    they are transparent to spectrum handoff. 9. Cross-layer design The communication
    challenges outlined above necessitate new communication protocols to be designed
    for spectrum-aware communication in xG networks. As explained before, the performance
    of xG networking functionalities directly depend on the properties of the spectrum
    band in use. This direct relationship necessitates a cross-layer design in the
    entire xG networking protocol stack. In particular, the effects of the selected
    spectrum band and the changes due to spectrum mobility need to be carefully considered
    in the design of communication protocols. Moreover, the spectrum management functionalities
    such as spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff should work in collaboration with
    the communication protocols. Based on this motivation, in the following sections,
    we overview the challenges for the cross-layer design in xG networks. 9.1. Cross-layer
    challenges in spectrum management The dynamic nature of the underlying spectrum
    in xG networks necessitates communication protocols to adapt to the wireless channel
    parameters. Moreover, the behavior of each protocol affects the performance of
    other protocols. For example, different medium access techniques used in xG networks,
    directly affect the round trip time (RTT) for the transport protocols. Similarly,
    when re-routing is done because of link failures arising from spectrum mobility,
    the RTT and error probability in the communication path change accordingly. The
    change in error probability also affects the performance of the medium access
    protocols. Consequently, all these changes affect the overall quality of the user
    applications. The spectrum management function cooperates with the communication
    layers, as shown in Fig. 2. In order to decide the appropriate spectrum band,
    the spectrum management requires the information regarding QoS requirement, transport,
    routing, scheduling, and sensing. Hence, these interdependencies among functionalities
    of the communication stack, and their close coupling with the physical layer necessitate
    a cross layer spectrum management function which considers medium access, routing,
    and transport, and application requirements as well as available spectrum in the
    selection of the operating spectrum. 9.2. Cross-layer challenges in spectrum handoff
    Spectrum handoff results in latency, which affects the performance of the communication
    protocols. Thus, the main challenge in spectrum handoff is to reduce the latency
    for spectrum sensing. The spectrum handoff latency has adverse effects on the
    performance of transport protocols. Moreover, during spectrum handoff, the channel
    parameters such as path loss, interference, wireless link error, and link layer
    delay are influenced by the dynamic use of the spectrum. On the other hand, the
    changes in the PHY and MAC channel parameters can initiate spectrum handoff. Moreover,
    the user application may request spectrum handoff to find a better quality spectrum
    band. As shown in Fig. 2, the spectrum mobility function cooperates with spectrum
    management function and spectrum sensing to decide on an available spectrum band.
    In order to estimate the effect of the spectrum handoff latency, information about
    the link layer and sensing delays are required. Transport and application layer
    should also be aware of the latency to reduce the abrupt quality degradation.
    In addition, the routing information is also important for the route recovery
    using spectrum handoff. For these reasons, the spectrum handoff is closely related
    to the operations in all communication layers. 9.3. Cross-layer challenges in
    spectrum sharing The performance of spectrum sharing directly depends on the spectrum
    sensing capabilities of the xG users. Spectrum sensing is primarily a PHY layer
    function. However, in the case of cooperative detection, xG users should use ad
    hoc connection for exchanging sensing information, which necessitates a cross-layer
    design between spectrum sharing and spectrum sensing. It is clear that the performance
    of communication protocols depends on spectrum sensing, i.e., getting information
    about the spectrum utilization. Two major challenges exist in this aspect. The
    first challenge is the interference mitigation. While interference occurs at a
    receiver, spectrum scanning alone only provides information about transmitters
    [33]. Hence, cooperative techniques that necessitate transmitters to consider
    both their interference to other users and the interference at their receivers
    are required. The superiority of cooperative techniques in terms of system performance
    has already been demonstrated in many studies [15], [29], [40], [71]. On the other
    hand, such a collaboration increases the communication overhead and may lead to
    overall system performance degradation when channel capacity or energy consumption
    is considered. Consequently, effective spectrum sharing techniques that enable
    efficient collaboration between different xG nodes in terms of spectrum sensing
    information sharing are required. The second challenge about spectrum sensing
    is that the whole spectrum cannot be sensed all the time. More specifically, due
    to the huge range of spectrum foreseen for xG networks, a significant amount of
    time is required to sense the whole spectrum. Since sensing consumes energy this
    process has to be carefully scheduled. As a result, it may not be practical to
    assume that a node has an accurate knowledge about the spectrum at all times.
    Moreover, current radio technologies prevent continuous spectrum sensing if only
    a single radio is deployed on a device. During communication, spectrum sensing
    has to be stopped to switch to the required channel and perform communication.
    Hence, this operation requires cross-layer interaction between the physical layer
    and the upper layers. More specifically, communication attempts need to be coordinated
    with spectrum sensing events. As an alternative, the effect of using multiple
    radios has been investigated in [54], where a two transceiver operation is considered
    such that a transceiver always listens to the control channel for sensing. This
    operation improves the system performance, however, the complexity and device
    costs are high. The spectrum sharing techniques discussed in Section 7 decouples
    spectrum allocation and spectrum sensing. In decentralized cognitive MAC (DC-MAC)
    scheme proposed in [72], a cross-layer approach for spectrum allocation and spectrum
    sensing is considered. Contrary to many work, in [72], limited spectrum sensing
    is addressed, where only a portion of the whole spectrum can be sensed. Moreover,
    spectrum sensing is jointly performed with spectrum allocation and application
    layer such that the node senses a portion of the spectrum only if it will allocate
    a channel due to a request from the application layer. First, an optimal approach
    for channel allocation is provided followed by a greedy suboptimal approach. A
    node is assumed to be able to sense one channel among N possible channels. Through
    performance evaluation, it is shown that the greedy approach closely approximates
    the optimal solution. Moreover, this solution is also robust to inaccuracies in
    spectrum sensing and limited knowledge. 9.4. Cross-layer challenges in upper layers
    Since available spectrum bands in xG networks with multi-hop communication are
    different for each hop, spectrum sensing information is required for topology
    configuration in xG networks. Moreover, a major design choice for routing in xG
    networks is the collaboration between routing and spectrum decision. If the optimal
    route from an xG user to another results in interference to the primary users,
    end-to-end latency or packet losses can be affected along the route due to this
    interaction. To mitigate the degradation, multiple spectrum interfaces at intermediate
    nodes may be selected. Therefore, end-to-end route may consist of multiple hops
    traversing different spectrum bands. Finally, re-routing needs to be performed
    in a cross-layer fashion. If a link failure occurs due to spectrum mobility, the
    routing algorithm needs to differentiate this failure from a node failure. Furthermore,
    intermediate xG users can perform re-routing by exploiting the spectrum information
    available from spectrum sensing functionality select better routes method. Due
    to the dynamic frequency of operation, the RTT and packet loss rates vary in xG
    networks, which leads to variations in packet transmission delay. Moreover, medium
    access schemes introduce access delay. All these factors influence the round trip
    time of a connection, which in turn affect the performance of transport protocols.
    Moreover, the latency associated with a spectrum handoff increases the instantaneous
    RTT of the packet transmission. Consequently, transport protocols for xG networks
    should be designed in a spectrum aware approach that introduces cooperative operation
    with the other communication layers. 10. Conclusions xG networks are being developed
    to solve current wireless network problems resulting from the limited available
    spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage by exploiting the existing
    wireless spectrum opportunistically. xG networks, equipped with the intrinsic
    capabilities of the cognitive radio, will provide an ultimate spectrum-aware communication
    paradigm in wireless communications. In this survey, intrinsic properties and
    current research challenges of the xG networks are presented. We investigate the
    unique challenges in xG networks by a bottom-up approach, starting from the capabilities
    of cognitive radio techniques to the communication protocols that need to be developed
    for efficient communication. Moreover, novel spectrum management functionalities
    such as spectrum sensing, spectrum analysis, and spectrum decision as well as
    spectrum mobility are introduced. The discussions provided in this survey strongly
    advocate spectrum-aware communication protocols that consider the spectrum management
    functionalities. This cross-layer design requirement necessitates a rethinking
    of the existing solutions developed for wireless networks. Many researchers are
    currently engaged in developing the communication technologies and protocols required
    for xG networks. However, to ensure efficient spectrum-aware communication, more
    research is needed along the lines introduced in this survey. References [1] 3GPP2,

    provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures
    and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, CR networks impose challenges
    due to the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, as well as the diverse
    QoS requirements of various applications. Spectrum management functions can address
    these challenges for the realization of this new network paradigm. To provide
    a better understanding of CR networks, this article presents recent developments
    and open research issues in spectrum management in CR networks. More specifically,
    the discussion is focused on the development of CR networks that require no modification
    of existing networks. First, a brief overview of cognitive radio and the CR network
    architecture is provided. Then four main challenges of spectrum management are
    discussed: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
    mobility. Published in: IEEE Communications Magazine ( Volume: 46, Issue: 4, April

    10.1109/MCOM.2008.4481339 Publisher: IEEE Introduction Current wireless networks
    are characterized by a static spectrum allocation policy, where governmental agencies
    assign wireless spectrum to license holders on a long-term basis for large geographical
    regions. Recently, because of the increase in spectrum demand, this policy faces
    spectrum scarcity in particular spectrum bands. In contrast, a large portion of
    the assigned spectrum is used sporadically, leading to underutilization of a significant
    amount of spectrum [1]. Hence, dynamic spectrum access techniques were recently
    proposed to solve these spectrum inefficiency problems. Sign in to Continue Reading

    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Spectrum sharing mechanisms have evolved to meet different
    needs related to increasing spectrum use efficiency. At first, decentralized and
    opportunistic cognitive radios (and cognitive radio networks) were the primary
    focus of research for these mechanisms. This gradually transitioned toward the
    development of cooperative sharing methods based on databases, typified by TV
    white spaces databases. Spectrum sharing is now the basis for the dynamic and
    fine-grained spectrum rights regime for the citizen''s band radio service (CBRS)
    as well as for license shared access (LSA). The emergence of the cryptocurrency
    Bitcoin has stimulated interest in applying its underlying technology, blockchain,
    to other applications as well, such as securities trading and supply chain management.
    This paper explores the application of blockchain to radio spectrum management.
    While blockchains could underlie radio spectrum management more broadly, we will
    focus on dynamic spectrum sharing applications. Like the cooperative approaches
    currently in use, blockchain is a database technology. However, a blockchain is
    a decentralized database in which the owner of the data maintains control. We
    consider the benefits and limitations of blockchain solutions in general, and
    then examine their potential application to four major categories of spectrum
    sharing. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking

    Agency: I. Introduction Blockchain has been heralded as a technology that could
    be as important as the Internet [2]. Secure distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies
    based on blockchain technologies could have many applications and be broadly disruptive.
    This paper examines one potential use case, exploring the ways this technology
    might be applied to spectrum sharing.1 While in this paper we focus on blockchain
    as it applies to spectrum sharing, there may be situations where blockchain could
    be applied to non-sharing-based approaches, such as its use in spectrum license
    databases or possibly as part of a spectrum usage application. Sign in to Continue

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: In this paper,
    new enhanced cognitive radio networks (E-CRNs) based on spectrum sharing (SS)
    and spectrum aggregation (SA) are proposed for fifth generation (5G) wireless
    networks. The E-CRNs jointly exploit the licensed spectrum shared with the primary
    user (PU) networks and the unlicensed spectrum aggregated from the industrial,
    scientific, and medical bands. The PU networks include TV systems in TV white
    space and different incumbent systems in the long term evolution time division
    duplexing bands. The harmful interference from the E-CRNs to the PU networks are
    delicately controlled. Furthermore, the coexistence between the E-CRNs and other
    unlicensed systems, such as WiFi, is studied. The E-CRNs framework including dynamic
    spectrum management (DSM) is designed for the key parameters of licensed SS and
    unlicensed SA. The essential tradeoff between sharing efficiency and aggregation
    efficiency for the E-CRNs is discussed. Based on this tradeoff, a spectrum lean-management
    scheme is proposed to fulfill the DSM. Moreover, a water-filling algorithm is
    designed to dynamically access the available spectrum. Numerical results demonstrate
    that the proposed E-CRNs can significantly improve the system performance in terms
    of data rate, outage probability, and spectrum efficiency. In particular, the
    E-CRNs framework provides a spectrum usage prototype for 5G wireless communication
    networks. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Communications ( Volume: 66, Issue:

    Introduction Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been proposed as one of the
    most promising communication technologies to deal with the “spectrum scarcity”
    issues with the rapid development of wireless applications, especially for the
    coming the fifth generation (5G) communication systems and beyond [1]–[7]. In

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: This article
    outlines the fundamental modeling issues of opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive
    radio networks. In particular, we identify the effects of connection-based channel
    usage on the QoS performance of spectrum management techniques. During the transmission
    period of a secondary user''s connection, the phenomenon of multiple spectrum
    handoffs due to interruptions of primary users arises quite often. In addition
    to multiple interruptions, the connection-based channel usage behaviors are also
    affected by spectrum sensing time, switching between different channels, generally
    distributed service time, and channel contention between multiple secondary users.
    An analytical framework based on the preemptive resumption priority M/G/1 queueing
    theory is introduced to characterize the effects of the above factors simultaneously.
    The proposed generalized analytical framework can incorporate various system parameters
    into the design of very broad spectrum management techniques, including spectrum
    sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. The applications
    of this analytical framework on spectrum decision as well as spectrum mobility
    are discussed, and some open issues using this framework are suggested in this
    article. Published in: IEEE Wireless Communications ( Volume: 18, Issue: 6, December

    allows low-priority secondary users to temporarily utilize the unused licensed
    channel of high-priority primary users, thereby significantly improving overall
    spectrum efficiency [1]. However, the secondary users need to vacate the occupied
    channel when the primary users appear. In order to return the occupied channel
    to the primary user and discover a suitable target channel to resume the unfinished
    transmission, spectrum handoff procedures are initiated for the secondary users.1
    Spectrum handoff in CR networks is different from the conventional handoff mechanisms
    in cellular mobile networks. Spectrum handoff considers two types of users with
    different priorities, where the high-priority primary users have the right to
    interrupt the transmission of the low-priority secondary users. When the interruption
    event occurs, the secondary user must stop using the current channel even though
    the received signal strength is still acceptable. In contrast, all users in the
    conventional handoff mechanisms have the same priority to access channels, and
    they change their operating channels mainly due to deterioration of signal quality
    [2]. Basically, according to the principle of selecting the target channel for
    spectrum handoff, the operating modes of the secondary networks can be categorized
    as nonhopping and hopping. In the non-hopping mode, the secondary user always
    stays on its current operating channel when it is interrupted, which is the basic
    mode of IEEE 802.22 systems [3]. In the hopping mode, the interrupted secondary
    user can stay on its current operating channel or change to another channel according
    to traffic statistics. An example of the hopping mode is the phase-shifting hopping
    method used in IEEE 802.22 systems [3]. Secondary users'' connections may execute
    multiple handoffs during its transmission period due to interruptions from primary
    users [4]. Clearly, these handoffs will degrade the quality of service (QoS) performance
    of the secondary users in providing sensitive traffic. Sign in to Continue Reading

    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Cognitive radio networks aim at enhancing spectrum
    utilization by allowing cognitive devices to opportunistically access vast portions
    of the spectrum. To reach such ambitious goal, cognitive terminals must be geared
    with enhanced spectrum management capabilities including the detection of unused
    spectrum holes (spectrum sensing), the characterization of available bands (spectrum
    decision), the coordination with other cognitive devices in the access phase (spectrum
    sharing), and the capability to handover towards other spectrum holes when licensed
    users kick in or if a better spectrum opportunity becomes available (spectrum
    mobility). In this paper, a game theoretic framework is proposed to evaluate spectrum
    management functionalities in cognitive radio networks. The spectrum selection
    process is cast as a non-cooperative game among secondary users who can opportunistically
    select the "best" spectrum opportunity, under the tight constraint not to harm
    primary licensed users. Different quality measures for the spectrum opportunities
    are considered and evaluated in the game framework, including the spectrum bandwidth,
    and the spectrum opportunity holding time. The cost of spectrum mobility is also
    accounted in the analytical framework. Numerical results are reported to assess
    the quality of the game equilibria. Published in: GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global

    Honolulu, HI, USA I. Introduction Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are emerging
    as a viable solution to solve spectrum shortage/efficiency problems. CRNs are
    based on cognitive devices [1] which are able to configure their transmission
    parameters (e.g., frequency band, waveforms, etc.) on the fly depending on the
    surrounding environment, consequently exploiting under-utilized spectrum portions.
    The motivation for cognitive radio stems from various measurements of spectrum
    utilization which generally show that spectrum is under-utilized, in the sense
    that the typical duty cycle of spectrum usage at a fixed frequency and at a random
    geographical location is low. This means that there are many “holes” in the radio
    spectrum that may be exploited for use by wireless users other than the spectrum
    licensee. To this extent, even “unlicensed” (secondary) cognitive radio users
    can be allowed to use licensed spectrum, provided that they do not interfere with
    any primary licensed user. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    Abstract Broadcasting is the simplest form of communication in which nodes disseminate
    the same information simultaneously to all of their neighbors. Broadcasting has
    been widely used in many types of networks including wireless networks, wireless
    sensor networks, and mobile ad-hoc networks. Likewise these networks, broadcasting
    is also used in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to accomplish various tasks such
    as spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, spectrum management, and spectrum mobility.

    1. Introduction The concept of dynamic spectrum access by introducing the idea
    of cognitive radio has gained popularity among researchers as it opportunistically
    accesses the licensed frequency band without causing interference to the licensed
    users’ communication. Efficient use of under-utilized spectrum is the basic motivation
    behind cognitive radio networks. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) governs
    the overall spectrum usage in USA and also regulates the assignment of specific
    band of frequencies to a particular user. Spectrum purchased in accordance with
    FCC regulations is used by primary users (PU) or licensed users [1]. While the
    users which do not have a license and opportunistically access the vacant spectrum
    in the absence of primary user activity are named as cognitive radiousers or secondary
    users (CR users or SU users). Cognitive radio technology is different from other
    communication technologies. In CRNs, cognitive radio nodes actively gather information
    about the surroundings such as available transmission frequency and power needed.
    In this manner, CR node selects the best possible channel and also reconfigures
    operational characteristics of cognitive devices to dynamically adapt themselves
    with changing environment. These features allow the CR user to dynamically access
    the available channels and vacate them as soon as PR user becomes active, causing
    little or no interference with the primary radio nodes. Broadcasting is the fundamental
    part of wireless networks including cognitive radio networks as it is the basic
    means of communication between cognitive radio nodes. The benefits of broadcasting
    in wireless networks include efficient and simple spreading of information e.g.
    control data in the network without the need for complex routing protocols. Data
    dissemination can be done via broadcasting in wireless ad hoc networks where complexity
    is not preferred. In CRNs, the CR users have a pool of multiple channels from
    which they select the best channel for communication but all CR users may not
    have the same set of available frequencies [2]. Moreover, in case of PU activity,
    CR user must interrupt its communication and vacate the channel, search for a
    new channel and initiate broadcast from the beginning. Additionally, simple flooding
    of information via direct broadcasting (causing each node to re-broadcast the
    received information; famously called as broadcast storm problem) can result in
    clogging of entire network in extreme cases. Therefore, broadcasting in CRNs has
    new and complex challenges which have not been encountered in traditional wireless
    networks due to the dynamic nature of cognitive networks. As it can be seen in
    Fig. 1, the channels for broadcasting are identical for all the nodes surrounding
    the source node i.e. node A in case of conventional wireless networks whereas
    each CR node in CRNs has a set of channels or frequencies on which it can communicate
    which may not be available to all CR nodes in the network [3]. Therefore, data
    dissemination via broadcasting is especially challenging in CRNs. Additionally,
    collision and contention issues in case of multiple simultaneous broadcasts have
    not been as deeply analyzed in CRNs as compared to conventional wireless networks.

    key characteristics of broadcasting strategies in cognitive radio networks. •

    Section 2 describes the broadcasting basics and broadcasting strategies in wireless
    networks in general while Section 3 is designated to the discussion of broadcasting
    in cognitive radio networks. Then, in Section 4, we discuss broadcast storm problem
    in cognitive radio networks. Sections 5 describes the issues, challenges, and
    future research directions of broadcasting in CRNs. Finally, Section 6 concludes
    the paper. 2. Broadcasting in wireless networks Wireless networks include a vast
    variety of networks, each of which is different from the other in one or another
    way e.g. cellular networks are centralized networks while MANETs are ad hoc based
    infrastructure-less networks. Similarly, WLANs are static networks while VANETs
    are mobile vehicular networks where communication among vehicles is dynamic and
    ever-changing. The basic principle of broadcasting in all wireless networks is
    same, i.e., a node transmits a message to all other nodes in its immediate neighborhood
    and the paramount objective is to spread the transmitted information throughout
    the network (cf., Fig. 2). Based on the type of network, broadcast message is
    conventionally flooded throughout the network which causes contention and collision
    issues. Therefore, direct broadcasting via flooding can lead to network failure
    and jamming which necessitates the evolution of novel and adaptive broadcasting
    protocols. Download : Download high-res image (301KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Broadcasting strategy in wireless networks. 2.1. Broadcasting goals
    Broadcasting in wireless networks in its most basic form is referred to as flooding.
    Flooding is the network-wide transmission of information along with each node
    re-transmitting the received information to its immediate neighbors and ensuring
    that the data is successfully disseminated throughout the network. Broadcasting
    in wireless networks(WNs) is subject to many conditions which can be characterized
    in the following ways: • Efficient message delivery: While broadcasting in wireless
    networks, the parameters that are primarily optimized are the throughput and latency.
    Therefore, the time it takes a piece of information to be transferred from a single
    node to all of its neighbors should be calibrated carefully so as to ensure efficient
    message delivery. • Efficient usage of the available spectrum resources: During
    broadcast, all resources should be utilized optimally especially the spectrum
    reserved for control information. For example, in cellular networks in order to
    conserve spectrum usage frequency reuse and sectoring is done. • Minimum time
    consumption: It should ensure that the message delivery takes less time. • Less
    overhead generation: The overall network overhead should be less than the total
    efficiency of the network. Broadcasting is a simple and fast method of data dissemination
    in a network where proper architecture has not been realized and network is in
    its natal stages. Broadcasting in ad-hoc context is utilized for discovering immediate
    neighbors whenever a new node is initialized in a network and also for disclosure
    of novel routes to specific destination motes in case of node failure or emergence
    of new nodes in the network (cf., Fig. 3). Broadcasting is also a feasible solution
    for distribution of control information throughout the network. For example, in
    MANETs, frequent requests for route updation and address conflict resolution are
    broadcast into the network, and in WSNs, broadcasting is used to synchronize neighbors
    according to their sleep and wake up time periods so that whenever a node wakes
    up to transmit data, corresponding destination is ready for reception. Download

    Uses of broadcasting in wireless networks. 2.2. Broadcast storm problem in wireless
    networks As discussed in Section 2, broadcasting is conventionally done through
    flooding technique in ad-hoc wireless networks, i.e., whenever a node wants to
    broadcast a message, it is wirelessly transmitted to immediate neighbors. The
    neighbors on receiving packet/broadcast message, re-transmit it once to all neighbors
    within their range. It is evident that such unchecked broadcasting can result
    in several issues. Such a scenario is called broadcast storm problem (BSP). Discussed
    below are some of the problems that arise due to broadcast storm problem. • Contention:
    Since wireless channel is shared among multiple nodes, therefore, whenever flooding
    is initiated, multiple nodes in close vicinity might decide to re-transmit the
    message simultaneously so that they have to contend for channel access among themselves
    [4]. For example, in Fig. 2, 3rd set of re-transmissions represents the contention
    between nodes B and C. • Collision: The network architectures in WNs under discussion
    are MANET, VANET and WSNs in which there is lack of back-off mechanism, RTS/CTS
    confirmation and collision detection. Thus, during flooding collisions can occur
    more often and can result in information loss. It is clear from Fig. 2 that collision
    will occur between nodes D and B at 2nd set of re-transmissions and no information
    will be received by node E. • Redundant re-broadcasts: In case of BSP, there are
    many packets that are transmitted again and again as a result of flooding. These
    redundant re-broadcasts increase the overall network overhead and can result in
    network isolation or breakdown in extreme cases. In Fig. 2, redundant broadcasts
    are generated as soon as the 2nd set of re-transmissions is initiated. 3. Broadcasting
    in cognitive radio networks 3.1. Cognitive radio networks basics The idea of cognitive
    radio networks was introduced by J. Mitola in 1999. Cognitive radio networks were
    introduced due to (a) limited spectrum availability for wireless communication,
    (b) fixed assignment of spectrum, only licensed users occupy spectrum as-and-when
    needed, and (c) inefficient use of spectrum. In CRNs, cognitive nodes are programmed
    to (1) make use of vacant frequency bands in unlicensed spectrum and also (2)
    exploit licensed bands in case of absence of licensed user nodes. In spite of
    its advantages, cognitive radio networks are still subject to certain constraints.
    The first constraint is that the CR node should not interfere with PR node communication.
    Moreover, whenever a PR node becomes active and decides to occupy a specific channel,
    then, the CR node communicating on the said channel should immediately vacate
    it (cf. Fig. 4). Since multiple channels are available to CR nodes for communication,
    therefore, in order for successful delivery of message to occur between any two
    CR nodes, both nodes need to be tuned on the same channel. Download : Download

    network characteristics. The management of unoccupied channels can be done in
    two ways: (1) infrastructure based, in which a spectrum broker is responsible
    for spectrum sensing, assignment and management, and (2) infrastructure-less,
    in which CR nodes themselves are responsible for spectrum sensing, assignment
    and management. The former is not preferred over the latter because of its requirement
    of a dedicated control channel and it also exposes the network to different threats
    like Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In this paper, we concentrate on infrastructure-less
    architecture. In infrastructure-less architecture, CR nodes are responsible for
    spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, spectrum management, and spectrum mobility.
    Therefore, for certain essential networking tasks like neighbor discovery, route
    discovery, channel assignment etc., CR nodes need broadcasting to share control
    information among CR nodes. The control information may also contain bandwidth
    requirements, primary user presence and location [5]. Being cognitive in nature,
    besides the aforementioned tasks, CR nodes need to share the spectrum sensing
    information and local measurements with all of its neighbors. Besides this, whenever
    a CR user switches to a channel, it has to rebroadcast in order to facilitate
    routing in cognitive radio networks [6]. Broadcasting is also important for network
    setup problem [7] in which CR nodes for the first time contacts with other nodes.
    3.2. Broadcasting protocols in cognitive radio networks Broadcasting is vital
    but extremely challenging in cognitive radio networks due to heterogeneous spectrum
    availability. This is due to the fact that channels are spread over a widely separated
    frequency band (the term frequency band and channel will be used interchangeable
    in the rest of the paper). Broadcasting protocols for CRNs are provided in chronological
    order in Table 1, while their comparison and summary are given in Table 2. For
    instance, during spectrum sensing a cognitive radio node may sense widely separated
    consecutive non-overlapping channels having frequency bands ranging between 300
    and 3000 MHz, where there may co-exist different licensed based primary networks
    like GSM, UMTS, and TV. In addition, cognitive radio nodes may encounter frequency
    band from unlicensed band like ISM based-networks, for instance bluetooth, hiperlan,
    IEEE 802.11, etc., over these frequency bands. Whether licensed or unlicensed,
    these frequency bands may have different channel transmission characteristics,
    propagation delays, bandwidths and other constraints. Besides this, allowed transmission
    power varies for different frequency bands, as mentioned by FCC regulations. In
    this fashion, instead of transmission on single spectrum band, if CR nodes exploit
    the availability of multiple widely separated spectrum bands and use them for
    transmission. Then, as a result, lower power is required to be used in each spectrum
    and less interference with PR nodes is achieved. Therefore, cognitive networks
    have the potential to utilize spectrum that is otherwise wasted by licensed users.

    the traffic pattern and channels’ occupancy of primary radio nodes over this widely
    spread spectrum band vary with technology to technology. Thus, it is essential
    to correctly select channels allowing reliable communication among CR nodes as
    well as channels that increase the number of CR receivers. Selecting a reliable
    channel having low PR occupancy, helps the operation of broadcasting. Therefore,
    we have coupled broadcasting with channel selection. For a certain broadcast message
    to be successfully delivered, channel selection is the basic step in cognitive
    radio networks. 3.3. Key characteristics of broadcasting strategy in cognitive
    radio networks The key characteristics of any broadcasting strategy in cognitive
    radio networks must include: • Efficient message delivery: It means that all the
    nodes receive the message. • Efficient usage of the available spectrum resources:
    It means that CRNs do not consider a single static control channel because it
    is not able to use the spectrum resources efficiently. • Consider primary users’
    constraints: Do not create interference to primary nodes and select reliable channels.
    • Less time consumption: It should ensure that the message delivery takes less
    time. • Less overhead generation: The network overhead should be less. • Less
    channel switching time: As it has many constraints, whenever CR node switches
    between different channels a delay is added which affects the overall performance
    efficiency of the network. Net channel switching time should be low. • The returning
    probability of primary user over a channel should be low enough so that the CR
    nodes easily utilize that channel for long period of time. 3.4. Classification
    of broadcasting strategies We classify the broadcasting strategies in the context
    of cognitive radio networks into five categories (cf. Fig. 5). The two major categories
    are based on number of channels used for broadcasting. Table 2 gives an overview
    of broadcasting protocols and their characteristic parameters for CRNs. Download

    Classification of broadcasting techniques for cognitive radio networks. 3.4.1.
    Complete broadcasting In this approach, message is broadcasted to all the available
    channels. This approach ensures the reception of packets by all CR nodes, at the
    cost of: • Higher channel switching time. • Higher delay in broadcasting. • Higher
    energy consumption by CR nodes. • Broadcast storm problem [4]. In [12], complete
    broadcasting is done to find out the ergodic sum capacity of CR-MAC i.e. CR multiple
    access channel. This can result in network overhead as depicted in above points
    and should be implemented while keeping network back haul under consideration.
    3.4.2. Broadcasting over a dedicated control channel (common control channel ,‘CCC’)
    In this approach, a control channel that operates on same frequency known to all
    CR nodes in a network is used to broadcast control information i.e. channel occupancy
    status, and spectrum management queries. This approach has the following disadvantages:
    • Higher channel contention and congestion • Exposure to different attacks like
    DoS attack. • Channel resources are wasted unnecessarily and inefficient use of
    spectrum takes place. • Decrease in throughput. • A dedicated control channel
    may not be free to all CR nodes due to spectrum heterogeneity. One can use ISM
    band as a control channel but it has its own limitations. This approach guarantees
    that all the nodes will receive the packets at the cost of above constraints.
    The problem becomes complex in the scenario of infrastructure-less cognitive radio
    network architecture. Yang et al. [25] assume that a dedicated control channel
    is available by providing a radio interface to access points to exchange coordination
    information among CR nodes. Pérez-Romero et al. [26] have proposed a cognitive
    pilot channel. Common control channel is not almost feasible in the context of
    CRN. Kondareddy et al. and Akyildiz et al. [7], [27] have mentioned several problems
    of CCC. (1) A dedicated control channel is wasteful to channel resources. (2)
    A common control channel would get saturated as the number of users increases.
    (3) An adversary can jam the channel by intentionally flooding over the dedicated
    channel, this is denial of service (DoS) attack. Thus, dedicating a common control
    channel for entire network is not a good idea as it might not work as the chosen
    channel may not be available to all the users due to heterogeneous spectrum availability
    and PR occupancy. 3.4.3. Broadcasting over a set of channels Broadcasting over
    a set of channels has several advantages over complete broadcasting like: • Less
    channel contention and congestion. • Lower delay in information dissemination.
    • Less energy consumption. • Less channel switching time. • Less message overhead.
    The subset of channels should cover the neighbors of a node on all channels. At
    a glance, this approach seems fair but the selection of subset of channels plays
    a vital role in broadcasting. For instance, if a subset of channels, which is
    very frequency agile is selected, then it will not only make interference with
    the PR nodes but also increase the broadcasting traffic due to re-transmissions
    and channel switching time. Kondareddy and Agrawal [11] proposed selective broadcasting
    in which a set of channels is selected based upon neighbors coverage and redundancy
    and network overhead is minimized. Song and Xie [3] have proposed a distributed
    protocol BRACER for broadcast delay optimization in which a set of channels are
    selected for broadcast to reduce redundancy. In [17], broadcast scheduling and
    collision avoidance schemes have been discussed by broadcasting on a set of channels
    to reduce average broadcast delay. 3.4.4. Group based broadcasting This approach
    is distributed approach of channel assignment and is well suited for ad hoccognitive
    radio networks. This approach restricts some nodes or a set of nodes, to communicate
    with their neighbors on a particular channel. In simple words, it creates small
    islands of nodes and use a channel or a set of channels for broadcasting. But
    this approach should guarantee that this minimal set of nodes cover all the nodes
    distributed over a range of channels on a particular island of nodes. The main
    complexity with this approach is how to connect different nodes’ islands and how
    to share information among them. Broadcasting over a set of channels will also
    lead to possibility of lower network performance because of not using certain
    communication links. Lazos et al. [28] have proposed a cluster-based common control
    channel that keeps into account the spectrum opportunity. Furthermore, Chen et
    al. [9], give another example of group based broadcasts in which clusters of CR
    nodes are set up in order to reduce redundant broadcasts and minimize network
    overhead. 3.4.5. Broadcasting by randomly selecting any channel In this approach,
    CR nodes randomly select any channel and start broadcasting. But this will never
    ensure that all the neighbors will receive the information and secondly the channel
    switching time decreases enormously. In [15], a single hop scenario for spectrum
    sensing in cognitive radio networks has been presented in which channels are selected
    randomly to reduce computation complexity (cf. Table 2). Similarly, in [13], Gel’fand-Pinsker
    coding has been implemented on multi-hop CRNs to optimize achievable rate regions.
    Authors have investigated the limits of broadcast channels in CR relay nodes.
    Fahad et al. [14] propose an adaptive Local Healing Algorithm for broadcasting
    trees that have been broken due to hidden terminal or deafness problem. Channel
    assignment in [14] is done randomly for broadcasting in cognitive radio networks.
    But this approach will decrease the number of receivers as the number of channels
    increases [29]. Thus, selecting a reliable channel is highly important in broadcasting.
    3.4.6. Metric based broadcasting In this type of broadcasting, certain metrics
    are first calculated and tested for broadcasting on a specific channel. The metrics
    or parameters for selection of channel for broadcasting can depend on the scenario
    i.e for control information exchange one might consider the security as a vital
    metric etc. In [2], a greedy-based polynomial-time heuristic algorithm has been
    proposed for ensuring fair spectrum sharing where maximization of node ID ratio
    has been considered as a metric for channel broadcasting. Whereas in [19], counter
    has been set to symbolize which node does the broadcasting and which does not
    i.e if counter value is zero then packet is discarded and not re-broadcasted.
    Song et al. [10] and Ji et al. [20] make use of broadcasting trees for initiating
    a broadcast message. In [18] , only those SUs are used for broadcasting that have
    the highest optimal power capacity in CRNs. 4. Broadcast storm problem in cognitive
    radio networks When compared with conventional wireless networks, simple broadcasting
    through flooding in CRNs can be disastrous due to network challenges that are
    unique to CRNs. Channel diversity and spectrum management issues are open research
    issues as yet and no prior work has been done to link these issues to broadcast
    storm problem to the best of our knowledge. The characteristic traits of broadcast
    storm problem are same for all wireless networks whether it is a highly mobile
    network like VANET or a static network like wireless mesh network. The most simple
    way of data dissemination is through flooding technique in which each node re-broadcasts
    the received message exactly once on reception. There are many drawbacks of this
    kind of broadcasting. First of all, there will be a lot of redundant re-broadcasts
    due to the fact that omni-directional antennas are usually used and transmission
    coverage areas of many CR nodes residing in the same geographical region overlap.
    Moreover, if a CR node decides to broadcast on a particular channel then depending
    on the ratio of number of channels to the number of CR nodes, its neighbors might
    also decide to transmit on the same channel. This could result in contention issues
    and eventually lead to collisions at large scale. If there is no broadcast scheduling
    mechanism in the CR nodes, it could result in collisions and eventually lead to
    BSP. Following are some of the scenarios that can cause broadcast storm problem
    in cognitive radios: • BSP generation in neighbor discovery process: When a network
    is created or when new nodes emerge in a network, these nodes have no prior knowledge
    about network topology. So the first step in setting up communication in any network
    is neighbor discovery (ND) process. In CRNs, neighbor discovery is an open research
    issue that has been addressed by few researchers. In a neighbor discovery process
    for CRNs based on deterministic flooding based mechanism, all the nodes in a network
    are simultaneously initiate the ND process by flooding EMPTY messages on all channels
    available based on the distance threshold assigned to each node. It can be perceived
    clearly that the use of flooding to find neighbors in CRNs can result in broadcast
    storms. The first scenario that can take place is depending upon geographical
    position and channel reliability; multiple nodes may choose a single channel at
    the same instant for flooding EMPTY messages for ND. This will result in contention
    as well as collision issues. As there will be no acknowledgment of EMPTY messages
    in case of collision, the nodes will again transmit ND packets. Even if we limit
    this effect by using distance or regional leader metric, there will be serious
    contention as well as collision issues resulting in broadcast storm problem. For
    example, if a CRN as depicted in Fig. 6 is considered for ND process then CR user
    labeled as 1 will receive EMPTY messages from users 2, 4, 5 and 6 simultaneously
    resulting in massive collision and information loss. While 8, 7 and 3 will receive
    EMPTY packets successfully and re-transmit them once in the second round. Whereas
    2, 4, 5, 6 and 1 will re-transmit ND information as acknowledgment for it was
    not received in last round. This process will continue and jam the network. In
    this scenario, channel 5 was chosen by all CR users simultaneously due to its
    reliability and durability. BSP will increase as the number of neighbors increases
    and network becomes more congested. Download : Download high-res image (384KB)

    in control information exchange: Hamdaoui and Shin [30] present the concept of
    dedicated control channel for exchange of control information like neighbor coordination
    and spectrum awareness etc. Exchanging control information through flooding on
    a CCC as mentioned in [30] is quite similar to flooding in traditional WNs as
    all CR node broadcast control information on the same channel at approximately
    the same time in case of neighbor discovery queries or spectrum awareness. Therefore,
    BSP can occur on dedicated CCC if the number of users exceeds a certain level
    and network is overloaded. Chen et al. [9] have addressed this problem and proposed
    a group-based control channel design in which clusters of CR nodes are created.
    Within a cluster a CCC is designated for all CR nodes to exchange control information
    inside the cluster. In this case also, BSP can occur if the number of CR nodes
    is high within each cluster and CCC is heavily loaded. This can be envisaged through
    Fig. 6 where nodes 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 form a cluster while the CCC is selected as
    channel 5. Flooding control information on ch-5 initiated by node 1 can result
    in BSP within a cluster. • BSP due to channel diversity: Let us consider a scenario
    where CR user 1 needs to communicate with node 2, 5 needs to communicate with
    user 3 and user 6 needs to communicate with user 7 in Fig. 6. As users 1, 6 and
    5 have overlapping coverage areas if they select the same channel for broadcasting
    through flooding then there will be collision and nodes will have to re-transmit
    information which will again result in contention, redundancy and collision scenarios.
    Therefore, channel diversity and spectrum scheduling are key factors in reducing
    BSP at local level in a CR network. • BSP due to PU activity: Due to lack of synchronization
    in channel switching among CR nodes in CRNs, deafness problem is created which
    eventually leads to BSP. Deafness problem has been explained in Section 5.5, now
    we will discuss how it can result in BSP generation. Let us consider Fig. 6, where
    node 2 needed to relay information to node 6. Therefore, node 2 broadcasts message
    to node 1 to relay it to node 6. As node 6 lies within coverage area of primary
    user marked red, when PU marked red becomes active, node 6 has to switch channel.
    Node 1 is unaware of this channel switching therefore it keeps re-transmitting
    the message under the assumption that packet has been lost. If deafness problem
    takes place at more than 2 nodes in CRN it could lead to broadcast storm problem
    in a small scale network. 5. Issues, challenges and future research directions
    of broadcasting in cognitive radio networks This section is dedicated to discussion
    of cognitive radio based research challenges and complexities in broadcasting
    that are added due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of cognitive radio
    networks. 5.1. Heterogeneity of channels in CRNs and challenges due to channel
    diversity In order to maintain synchronous communication in cognitive radio networks,
    control information has to be exchanged periodically among nodes. This is a challenging
    task due to the intrinsic properties of cognitive radio networks such as the heterogeneity
    of channels that are available to CR nodes i.e. number of channels available for
    communication for CR nodes varies according to their location and time. Level
    of complexity in broadcasting is increased when PR user channel occupancy and
    traffic pattern is taken into account. The channel occupancy pattern of PR nodes
    is of crucial importance because it tells about how heavily a channel is occupied
    by PR user; if a channel is frequently occupied then it is less likely to be used
    by CR node. As PR activity is uncertain, the availability of channels for CR nodes
    is also uncertain. Additionally, PR nodes have different channel occupancy patterns
    in different locations and utilize various technologies. Thus, it is difficult
    to predict the time varying channel occupancy pattern. As a result, this adds
    another level of complexity to cognitive radio networks. Different channels in
    CRNs have different penetration power and transmission ranges based upon the frequency
    they have. A low frequency signal can travel farther and has better penetration
    power when compared with higher frequency signal. Therefore, different channels
    will have different broadcast coverage area at different time depending upon their
    geographical location and thus different set of neighbors. Consequently, whenever
    a CR node switches from one channel to another, its transmit power as well as
    neighbors changes which further complicates the broadcasting process. 5.2. Unpredictable
    nature of wireless channel availability The second challenge is that CR nodes
    may encounter a huge set of available channel set spread over wide frequency range.
    CR nodes have to disseminate information to all of its neighboring nodes in order
    to facilitate different networking tasks as mentioned earlier. In order to accomplish
    this, CR nodes have to access, compete, and select a channel or a set of channels
    and it is referred to as control channel. But this information should be transmitted
    with minimum delay, having less message overhead, and less channel switching time.
    If CR nodes select a single channel then this channel should ensure that by broadcasting
    over this channel, CR nodes are able to disseminate the message to all of its
    neighbors. Otherwise, CR nodes select a set of channels so that the message reaches
    to all of its neighbors. Selecting channels without considering its occupancy
    and use them for broadcasting may lead to interference with PR nodes and also
    come up with many re-transmissions of broadcast messages. This results in large
    overhead and traffic generation. For instance, consider a highly opportunistic
    network (where available channel set to CR nodes changes very fastly), in which
    a CR node randomly selects a channel for broadcasting without considering the
    PR occupancy and transmit the control information. There is a very high probability
    that a PR node starts communication over that channel, and results in (1) interference
    with PR nodes and (2) all the neighbor nodes may not receive the broadcasted packet
    being on different channels. 5.3. Challenges of broadcasting over a single channel
    Broadcasting over a single channel may cause a situation that all the nodes may
    not receive the message being on different channels due to the fact that the probability
    that a channel is common to all nodes is very small. Therefore, there is a need
    to broadcast the control information over more than one channel to ensure that
    every neighbor receives a copy. In the literature, most proposals assume that
    the set of available channels is static i.e. the channels available to use is
    fixed at the time of network initialization. Since, cognitive radio may allow
    the spectrum available to change dynamically, the set of channels may change dynamically
    also. Besides this, existing proposals often assume that the available channels
    are homogeneous i.e. different channels have similar range and support similar
    data rates. The homogeneity assumption is nullified when different channels may
    be located on widely separated slices of frequency spectrum with different bandwidths,
    and different propagation characteristics. Several techniques of broadcasting
    in multi-channel multi-hop wireless networks have been proposed [4]. But these
    techniques are not feasible for cognitive radio networks. For instance, the aforementioned
    proposed techniques of broadcasting consider multiple channels but they are static.
    Alternatively, in cognitive radio networks, channels are highly dynamic due to
    primary nodes activity. In addition, broadcasting in cognitive radio networks
    is expected to be done more frequently due to higher spatio-temporal availability
    of channels and mobility of PR and CR nodes. 5.4. Challenges in channel selection
    for broadcasting The authors of [11] proposed selective broadcasting in which
    a set of pre-selected channels are used to transmit control information. Basically,
    they are selecting the channel based on its degree. In simple words, they select
    those channels for broadcasting which has higher degree i.e. higher number of
    neighbor nodes. Let us suppose if this set of higher degree channels (contains
    higher number of nodes) has higher frequency agility, then there would be higher
    chances that CR nodes loose these channels. This implies that the set of channels
    used for broadcasting should not be dependent only on degree, instead it should
    also be dependent on the occupancy and traffic pattern. Selecting the channels
    which have higher number of CR nodes does not keep into account the dynamic behavior
    of cognitive radio networks. So, with higher frequency agility which is an intrinsic
    property of dynamic spectrum access networks, the selective and complete broadcast
    is not always feasible. 5.5. MAC layer issues CRNs have highly dynamic spectrum
    access properties due to which conventional MAC layer protocols do not work well
    in cognitive environments. Following are some of the challenges faced in cognitive
    radio at MAC layer. 5.5.1. Neighbor discovery coordination challenges Neighbor
    discovery process is initiated whenever a new CR node emerges in the network.
    It allows the CR node to become aware of its immediate neighbors also called as
    relay nodes in the case when destination node is not one of the neighbors. In
    cognitive radio context, whenever CR node switches to a new channel it needs to
    listen for PU activity on that particular channel as well as check whether other
    CR nodes have already occupied that channel. As mentioned earlier, each node can
    choose any channel from set of available channels as long as it does not interfere
    with PU activity. Therefore, in order to communicate with neighbors, the CR node
    needs to be tuned onto the channel that is same as that of its neighbor. Since
    CR node does not have any knowledge about its neighbor at the beginning of neighbor
    discovery procedure, therefore it needs to scan each channel to see which one
    is occupied by relevant relay node which can result in enormous delay as well
    as waste of energy. Therefore, broadcast by flooding cannot be done in CRNs as
    it would only cause network jamming and interfere with PU activity. Intelligent
    adaptive protocols are needed to address this problem. 5.5.2. Deafness challenges
    Deafness is quite similar in one aspect to hidden terminal problem in WNs. It
    can be seen in Fig. 7 that there are three primary users and multiple CR nodes
    within PU coverage area. In order to understand deafness problem, let us consider
    that CR node S1 needs to communicate with CR node D1 in a multi-hop fashion. A
    sends S1’s packet to B on a frequency coded as blue. In the meantime, PU user
    in blue frequency area becomes active and causes B to switch channel as B lies
    within its coverage area. But A is unaware of channel switch done by B therefore,
    it keeps re-transmitting the packet under the assumption that it is lost due to
    interference. Therefore, broadcasting protocols should be equipped to handle this
    sort of scenario. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Broadcasting in CRNs. 5.5.3. Collision avoidance through
    distributed access of spectrum Considering Fig. 7, let us assume that A needs
    to communicate with D2 while at the same time C needs to communicate with B. As
    both A and C have overlapping coverage area, if both of them switch onto the same
    channel for communication then there is bound to be collision, resulting in information
    loss. Therefore in order to avoid these kinds of contention and ultimately collision
    issues, there should be dynamic distributed scheduling at MAC layer for broadcasting.
    5.6. Network layer issues Conventionally, whenever a new node emerges in a network,
    it broadcasts its presence to immediate neighbors and in turn takes into account
    neighbor knowledge through neighbor discovery process while tuned on a single
    fixed frequency. This is not possible in CRNs due dynamic spectrum access and
    versatility of channels. Following are some of the challenges faced for broadcasting
    in CRNs in the context of network layer. 5.6.1. Route optimization dilemma One
    of the major issues in CRNs is the dearth of cooperative decision making between
    route and spectrum selection. In CRNs choosing a closest neighbor may not be optimal
    routing decision as it could result in more hop counts in long run. For example
    if S1 needs to send a packet to D2 in Fig. 7 then by considering only parameters
    like distance, location metrics we choose node D as our next hop (cf. Fig. 8)
    but it is clear that it only increases number of hops while same operation could
    have been performed considering the fact that D2 is within TX range of S1. Therefore,
    in CRNs route selection should be correlated with spectrum selection to reduce
    broadcasting delay. Download : Download high-res image (317KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Broadcasting in cognitive radio networks: deafness problem.
    5.6.2. Fluctuating interference at each path In conventional WNs, optimal route
    is usually selected on the basis of SNR percentage but in CRNs each hop may not
    be done on the same frequency. As mentioned earlier, high frequencies can carry
    data to short distances i.e TX range is low while they can carry more data as
    compared to low frequency signals. Therefore, channel diversity also affects the
    interference levels according to physical location, operating frequency and interface
    hardware. 5.6.3. Switching delay Since, the spectrum is large providing higher
    number of available channels to CR nodes and having heterogeneity. So, this heterogeneity
    brings different channel characteristics like transmission power, bandwidth, transmission
    delay, error rate, interference temperature, interference with PRs, number of
    CR on the channel, PR traffic etc. Therefore, broadcasting control information
    over all channels, in order to reach all neighbors is costly and incurred with
    large delay. Transmitting over every channel makes CR nodes switching to every
    channel, thus consumes energy and increase channel switching time. Besides this,
    if the number of available channels is larger than the number of available radios,
    then sending a packet on every channel will be quite expensive. Higher channel
    switching between data channels and common control channel (CCC) is required in
    the context of CR nodes that are equipped with single radio. Channel switching
    may result in with scheduling overhead and synchronization requirements. A good
    channel selection strategy should reduce frequent channel switching. Furthermore,
    channel switching degrades channel capacity. As CR nodes have to constantly check
    for PU activity and switch channel whenever PU is active, there is a switching
    delay added in result of broadcasting in CRNs. This switching delay is increased
    in case of multi-hop networks and needs to be incorporated into present broadcasting
    protocols. Broadcasting over all channels or multiple channels make CR nodes to
    switch to multiple channels, which leads to channel switching. Channel switching
    causes non-negligible delay for the transmission and consumes energy. Thus, channel
    switching can be minimized by using a reliable group of channels or a single channel
    for a long period of time. This can be achieved by selecting those channels which
    have lower PR activity. Another problem that channel switching brings is the updating
    of routing table that which node is available of which frequency band. In addition,
    higher channel switching also brings packet loses. 6. Conclusion In this work,
    we presented the detailed taxonomy of broadcasting strategies in cognitive radio
    networks. Our basic aim was to present a detailed study of broadcasting and its
    related challenges in cognitive radio networks. We have presented comprehensive
    classification of broadcasting strategies in CRNs. This classification is based
    upon the number of channels selected for broadcasting i.e. single channel or multiple
    channel. A comprehensive study of broadcast storm problem in cognitive radio networks
    has been carried out that also highlights the drawbacks in existing broadcasting
    mechanisms. Example scenarios for the generation of broadcast storms in cognitive
    radio networks have also been discussed in detail. In future, we plan to compare
    and optimize different broadcasting strategies for cognitive radio networks. References

    \a\nAbstract: Through the expeditious expansion of the wireless network, the unlicensed\
    \ bandwidth-\nbased devices are growing substantially as compared to the present\
    \ vacant bandwidth. Cognitive\nradio networks present a proﬁcient solution to\
    \ the spectrum shortage diminution hitch by allowing\nthe usage of the vacant\
    \ part of the spectrum that is not currently in use of the Primary User licensed\n\
    bandwidth to the secondary user or cognitive radio user. Spectrum management procedure\
    \ in\ncognitive radio network comprises of spectrum sharing, sensing and handoﬀ.\
    \ Spectrum handoﬀ plays\na vital role in spectrum management and primarily focuses\
    \ on single handoﬀ strategies. This paper\npresents a primary user traﬃc pattern-based\
    \ opportunistic spectrum handoﬀ (PUTPOSH) approach\nto use in the cognitive radio\
    \ networks. PUTPOSH permits a secondary user to sense the arrival of a\nprimary\
    \ user and use an opportunistic handoﬀ scheme. The opportunistic handoﬀ scheme\
    \ ﬁrstly\ndetects the arrival of the primary users by energy detection sensing\
    \ and secondly, it allows a cognitive\nradio user to decide whether to do handoﬀ\
    \ or not contingent upon the overall service time to reduce\nthe unused handoﬀs.\
    \ The handoﬀs can either be reactive or proactive based on the arrival rate of\
    \ the\nprimary user. The simulation results show that the presented PUTPOSH approach\
    \ (a) minimizes\nthe number of handoﬀs and the overall service time, and (b) maintains\
    \ the channel utilization and\nthroughput of the system at a maximal point.\n\
    Keywords: spectrum handoﬀ; spectrum sensing; cognitive radio networks; cognitive\
    \ radio user;\nprimary and secondary user\n1. Introduction\nThe number of devices\
    \ which make use of the licensed or unlicensed spectrum is growing swiftly,\n\
    and a spectrum shortage problem arises due to the existing unproductive spectrum\
    \ allocation strategies.\nThe current approaches are static-based and not capable\
    \ of adjusting to the increasing demand of the\nbandwidth requirements [1,2].\
    \ The cognitive radio network (CRN) provides a proﬁcient solution to\novercome\
    \ the spectrum shortage problem. CRN permits a secondary user (SU) which is also\
    \ known as\na cognitive radio user (CRU) to utilize the provisionally unused bandwidth\
    \ of the primary user (PU) to\nimprove the narrow spectrum resources. CRU increases\
    \ the utilization productivity of the channel\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1674; doi:10.3390/app10051674\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1674\n2 of 19\nwithout resettling\
    \ the predeﬁned rules of spectrum allocation [3]. The spectrum management method\n\
    in CRNs is mainly composed of three major steps. Firstly, spectrum sensing, where\
    \ CRU or SU get\nprovisional access to the vacant spectrum; spectrum sensing scans\
    \ and detects the vacant spectrum\nbands constantly by probing the PU actions.\
    \ Secondly, spectrum sharing, where many SUs access\nthose vacant spectrums; spectrum\
    \ sharing must be synchronized to avoid crash between various SUs.\nFinally, the\
    \ spectrum handoﬀ (SH)—in which an CRU ought to continue its spectrum access on\
    \ an\navailable channel (if the related PU originates).\nRecent research on CRN\
    \ focuses mainly on spectrum detection and exchange of information [4–8].\nSpectrum\
    \ transfer is becoming a challenging topic due to diﬀerent research actions related\
    \ to the\nheterogeneous network and also remains less studied [3,9]. Spectrum\
    \ transfer is considered as a\nvigorous step in spectrum management due to its\
    \ position for continuous switching from one available\nchannel to another without\
    \ compromise to its Quality of Service (QoS) [3]. There are two types of\nSH,\
    \ proactive and reactive handoﬀ [10–12]. In the proactive handoﬀ, the target channel\
    \ is selected\nwith regard to the PU’s interarrival pattern. It is used for data\
    \ transfer prior to any event of the actual\nhandoﬀ process. In the reactive handoﬀ,\
    \ to resumed the paused transmission a channel is selected by\nreal-time sensing\
    \ after the handoﬀ event takes place. The CRU can maintain the paused transmission\n\
    on the recently explored channel [10]. The prevailing work mainly focuses on the\
    \ single handoﬀ\napproach which may be proactive or reactive. The handoﬀ method\
    \ is preselected without considering\nthe PU arrival rate and it can be the reason\
    \ for channel underutilization and large handoﬀ delay.\nThe handoﬀ approach between\
    \ reactive or proactive is preselected without caring for the primary user\ntraﬃc\
    \ samples in the existing single handoﬀ strategies. The research eﬀorts described\
    \ in [9–14] are\nfocused on single SH approaches, where the handoﬀ process is\
    \ previously determined. The existing\nhandoﬀ approaches function in the theory\
    \ of shifting the channel on PU’s arrival and no methods in\nthese practices are\
    \ to reside and wait until PU completes a successful transmission. Preferably,\
    \ a CRU\nshould be familiar with the PU traﬃc pattern using its sensing capabilities\
    \ and the most appropriate\nhandoﬀ method wherever required.\nIn this paper, a\
    \ primary user traﬃc pattern-based opportunistic spectrum handoﬀ (PUTPOSH)\nscheme\
    \ is presented. It permits a CRU to sense the PU’s traﬃc through energy-eﬃcient\
    \ sensing [15–17]\nand then adopt a proactive or reactive handoﬀ strategy according\
    \ to the interarrival rate. PUTPOSH\nis comprised of three modules: (1) spectrum\
    \ sensing, (2) spectrum mobility management, and (3)\nspectrum handoﬀ decision.\
    \ In the spectrum sensing module, the energy detection technique is used\ndue\
    \ to its low computational features and working diﬃculty. The spectrum mobility\
    \ management\nobtains the PU interarrival information by spectrum sensing and\
    \ the dwelling period of a PU is\nforecasted with respect to the previous waiting\
    \ behavior in its licensed band. The major contribution\nof this research is the\
    \ spectrum handoﬀ decision module. The spectrum handoﬀ decision chooses on a\n\
    suitable handoﬀ class between reactive and proactive with regards to (w.r.t.)\
    \ the overall service time of\na CRU. The overall service time of a CRU comprises\
    \ of sensing, processing, waiting and transmission\ntimes. Spectrum handoﬀ takes\
    \ place when the PU appears on its bandwidth which is temporarily\nengaged by\
    \ the CRU. Apart from maintaining its transmission CRU must have to sense for\
    \ a new free\nchannel. When a free channel is sensed, the CRU can continue its\
    \ transmission on the recently vacant\nspectrum, packet failure can occur throughout\
    \ this handoﬀ method [2,18]. Moreover, A preemptive\nresume priority (PRP) M/M/1\
    \ queuing model is used to manage the transmission and incorporated to\ndiﬀerentiate\
    \ the spectrum usage behavior of PUs and SUs. The research aims to develop a PUTPOSH\n\
    algorithm with various handoﬀ modules that permit a CRU to detect patterns of\
    \ PU’s traﬃc and\nselect a reactive or proactive scheme accordingly. On the arrival\
    \ of PU, the CRU intelligently decides\nwhether to do handoﬀ or to wait for the\
    \ on-going channel depending upon the overall service time (in\nboth cases). A\
    \ simulation which included PUTPOSH was setup in Matlab to validate and show the\n\
    performance of the presented approach by comparing the results with some of the\
    \ existing reactive,\nproactive, and hybrid schemes in terms of the overall service\
    \ time, the number of handoﬀs and the\nchannel utilization.\nAppl. Sci. 2020,\
    \ 10, 1674\n3 of 19\nThis paper is organized as follows: the literature review\
    \ is presented in Section 2. The PUTPOSH\napproach is described in Section 3.\
    \ It comprises of three sections (a) the presented approach, (b) the\nqueuing\
    \ model, and (c) the iming diagram of CRU transmission. Section 4 describes the\
    \ simulation\nsetup and some of the results. Finally, the conclusion is given\
    \ in Section 5.\n2. Literature Review\nThe literature presented in this section\
    \ is generally absorbed on the spectrum sensing and\nhandoﬀ features.\n2.1. Spectrum\
    \ Sensing\nUnder channel shadowing and fading, the PU signal cannot be noticeable\
    \ to the CRU. The detection\ncapability of a single CRU is limited, which in turn\
    \ strongly aﬀects the PU transmission. A spectrum\nsensing scheme in CRNs with\
    \ cooperative nature is presented in [19] and is based upon the Amplify and\n\
    Forward (AF) protocol to reduce the sensing time of CRUs. Authors in [19] considered\
    \ an infrastructure\nof the cognitive radio network where a band manager is responsible\
    \ for communication between the\ncooperative CRUs. Authors deﬁned two protocols\
    \ to detect the PU arrival: (1) a non-cooperative\nprotocol, and (2) a totally\
    \ cooperative protocol. Another cooperative spectrum sensing framework is\nproposed\
    \ by Won-Yoel Lee and Ian. F. Akyildiz in [20] which delivers solution for the\
    \ sensing eﬃciency\nand interference avoidance problems. Sensing and transmission\
    \ cannot be done concurrently in CRNs,\ntherefore, it has to be bounded with the\
    \ transmission. The basic concept of sensing in CRNs is to\nprovide eﬃcient and\
    \ opportunistic communication to SUs. Data communication cannot be done which\n\
    suﬃciently reduces the transmission capabilities of SU.\nIn [21], authors presented\
    \ a framework based on the theory of multiclass to exploit the attainable\nthroughput\
    \ in CRN. Through the absence of the PU in the two-class hypothesis, the energy\
    \ range\nof sensing signal is separated into quantized areas while during the\
    \ presence of the PU, the sensing\nsignal is conserved. Authors claim that the\
    \ obtainable approach increases the throughput by providing\na higher amount of\
    \ transmission actions. In [22], authors formulated and analyzed the amount of\n\
    spectrum operation with diﬀerent groups of channels and with diﬀerent primary\
    \ and secondary users\nin synchronized network structures. Authors considered\
    \ realistic channels for the SUs and each channel\nis licensed to the PUs. The\
    \ CRU is supported by the spectrum handoﬀ and is authorized to utilize\nthe channels\
    \ by sensing outcomes and PU interruptions. In [23], authors studied resource\
    \ sharing for\nchunk based multi-carrier with time varied spectrum resources and\
    \ presented a novel opportunistic\ncapacity model. Authors divided the novel opportunistic\
    \ capacity model into two modules to reduce\nthe computational complexity and\
    \ solve them using the Lagrangian dual method. In [24], authors\ndeveloped a supportive\
    \ sensing method, which is based on the pairwise secondary user transmitter\n\
    and receiver. Authors presented the detailed protocol description to illustrate\
    \ the working of the\nprojected framework. The main objective is to minimize the\
    \ false alarm rate of the missed detection\nrate by adaptively correcting the\
    \ discovered threshold of every sensor.\nEnergy ﬁnding is a simple spectrum sensing\
    \ method that can be depicted as a Neyman\nPearson-like a binary hypothesis testing\
    \ issue which is developed using the chi-square, gamma/normal\nstatistical distributions\
    \ [25–27]. Energy detection is usually used for the low computational features\n\
    complexities [28,29]. Therefore, immense work can be found in the literature discussing\
    \ energy\ndetection in terms of fading channels, diversity systems, additive white\
    \ Gaussian noise and collaborative\ndetection [18,30–37]. However, the energy\
    \ detector is not capable of diﬀerentiating between the PU\nsignal and the noise\
    \ with a lower value of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) [38]. The solution to this\n\
    problem is presented in the sensing techniques that are based on Eigenvalue based\
    \ methods [39–42].\nUsing Eigenvalue based method, an energy detection scheme\
    \ is proposed in [43] that can eﬃciently\nperform under frequency selective channels\
    \ and noise uncertainty. The method proposed in [44]\nis a low complexity spectrum\
    \ sensing method that depends upon the exploitation of the sub-band\nenergy variations.\
    \ In [45], authors proposed a twofold threshold energy recognition scheme. Two\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1674\n4 of 19\nthresholds are used in double threshold schemes\
    \ instead of one. The region between the two thresholds\nis considered as the\
    \ uncertain region and CRU performs sensing again.\n2.2. Spectrum Handoﬀ\n2.2.1.\
    \ Proactive Handoﬀ\nIn [46], authors anticipated a proactive handoﬀ approach which\
    \ considered Short Time Backup\nChannel (STBC), the BC for CRU communication is\
    \ selected prior to the PU arrival. The handoﬀ\njudgment in STBC is dependent\
    \ upon the QoS of the ongoing channel. In this scheme, a backup\nchannel achieves\
    \ the usage of the bandwidth improvement for a short period whereas, in the complete\n\
    backup approaches, the BC is reserved continually with the ongoing channel. In\
    \ the STBC the lowest\nstage of the handoﬀ wait can be attained as compared to\
    \ without backup schemes. The STBC chooses\nthe marked channel in the handoﬀ prior\
    \ to the occurrence of the trigger event. A proactive Fuzzy Logic\n(FL) based\
    \ Spectrum Handoﬀ approach is proposed in [47] and presented the major principles\
    \ of FL\nto manage troubles professionally. Two FL controllers are used; ﬁrst\
    \ controller determines the space\namong CRU and PU. It examines the control of\
    \ CRU communication (without causing any inﬂuence on\nthe communication of the\
    \ nearest PU). The second controller measures the waiting of the CRU in the\n\
    ongoing channel. A handoﬀ is started if the QoS of the CRU is not suitable and\
    \ the high intervention\ncaused by the CRU on the nearest PU’s communication.\
    \ In [14], authors projected a methodology\nestablished upon an increased probability\
    \ Spectrum Handoﬀ having Cumulative Probability (SHCP)\nto decrease the handoﬀs\
    \ to achieve an improved quality of service. In this method, the PU decides\n\
    whether to wait or stay on its ongoing operating channel or do a handoﬀ. It depends\
    \ upon an algorithm\nof probability estimation however maintaining a backup reserve\
    \ channel. In [48], authors anticipated a\nproactive handoﬀ scheme based on a\
    \ probabilistic and predictive approach. It is slightly mandatory\ndue to the\
    \ indeﬁnite behavior of PUs. It was planned to decrease the latency and loss of\
    \ facts, and ﬁgure\nout through spectrum handoﬀ. Proactive handoﬀ gives an excessive\
    \ option to the SUs to continue\ntheir half-ﬁnished broadcast on the target station.\
    \ In [49], authors presented a distributed CRN scheme\nbased on the multi-armed\
    \ bandit method. Authors examined the blind spectrum choice problem of SUs\nby\
    \ considering a ﬁxed handoﬀ stay whose detecting aptitude of Cognitive Radio (CR)\
    \ is inadequate\nand the channel statistics are not known in advance. In this\
    \ scenario, SUs have made the choice of\neither (i) waiting at ongoing spectrum\
    \ with low accessibility or (ii) handing oﬀ to another spectrum\nwith higher accessibility.\n\
    2.2.2. Reactive Handoﬀ\nAuthors in [18], projected a reactive handoﬀ approach\
    \ named as dynamic frequency hopping\ncommunities (DFHC). DFHC is believed to\
    \ enhance QoS demands of CRUs while giving suitable and\nreliable sensing of the\
    \ spectrum for assuring the PU defense. In this research, a wireless regional\
    \ area\nnetwork cell or a CRU examined the accessibility of the new objective\
    \ channel while transmitting on\nan ongoing channel. To avoid intervention with\
    \ the PUs, the CRU maintains its communication on the\nselected channel and opens\
    \ sensing for other channels. Authors in [50], proposed a reactive handoﬀ\napproach\
    \ which uses an M/G/1 queuing model [18] to examine the channel utilization of\
    \ CRN. In this\napproach, a user can concurrently use various vacant channels\
    \ for transmitting CR. In [21], the authors\nproposed an M/G/1 queuing model to\
    \ resolve the spectrum handoﬀ problem. The interarrivals to the\nM/G/1 queue are\
    \ modeled and shared various vacant channels, for instance, the overall interarrivals\n\
    from all CRUs. The handoﬀ delay occurs at the maximum level when the PU arrived,\
    \ hence the handoﬀ\njudgment is completed. In [51], author presented a framework\
    \ comprises of probabilistic algorithms,\nand some other novel approaches including\
    \ CRU clustering and PRP M/G/1 queuing to attain better\ncompetence in spectrum\
    \ handoﬀ in a CRN. Authors claim that the proposed strategy performs better\n\
    than existing schemes in terms of accuracy in sensing the right channel, handoﬀ\
    \ latency, and energy\nconsumption. The authors of [52] projected a reactive handoﬀ\
    \ scheme for Zigbee in which a CRU can\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1674\n5 of 19\naccess\
    \ various channels via incessantly sensing and spectrum handoﬀ. The presented\
    \ sensing and\nhandoﬀ technique provides better results in a situation where the\
    \ noise is at a minimal level. However,\nas an energy detector, it cannot distinguish\
    \ between noise and PU signal, hence a false alarm can be\nactivated which produces\
    \ the useless handoﬀs.\n2.2.3. Hybrid Handoﬀ\nIn order to assure the requirement\
    \ of the wide bandwidth and to achieve the improved results in\nterms of QoS and\
    \ spectrum aggregation (SA), an approach is required which permits a PU or a CRU\
    \ to\nconcurrently use various spectrum groups [53]. CRU is a clever user who\
    \ can sense and use vacant\nspaces by probing the radio atmosphere. This class\
    \ of sensing builds probably to join the free channels\nby spectrum aggregation.\
    \ In [54], the author presented a scheme named hybrid handoﬀ, which is\nfounded\
    \ on dynamic spectrum aggregation (DSA) to discover the manners of a CRU through\
    \ handoﬀ.\nEach time the CRU performs a handoﬀ to BC when PU visits back to its\
    \ certiﬁed channel. According to\nCRU, all the channels are BCs except the present\
    \ channel (can be either utilized or idle). When PU\narrives at the present channel;\
    \ on the one hand, if the channel is free, the communication of CRU can be\nsmoothly\
    \ moved into it while on the other hand if all the channels are assessed to be\
    \ busy, the CRU will\nwait till the completion of the PU communication. In [55],\
    \ authors developed a spectrum-management\nscheme and estimated the performance\
    \ in varied spectrum environment (opportunistic and centralized\nCRNs). Authors\
    \ considered a determined threshold period for spectrum handoﬀ delay to improve\
    \ the\nperformance for both opportunistic and negotiated situations with backup\
    \ channels. In [54], authors\ndescribe that the CRU should select the probability\
    \ of minimum handoﬀ to reduce the handoﬀ delay\nand the number of handoﬀs. The\
    \ main application of this method makes it achievable to give superior\nQoS. The\
    \ level of SH gap is minimized whenever the BCs are utilized; it guides towards\
    \ the utilization\nof channels which are continuously vacant (most of the time).\n\
    Table 1 summarizes the handoﬀ strategies in a comparative manner, which are also\
    \ discussed\nin the above subsections. The strategies are compared on the basis\
    \ of channel backup property,\nbandwidth utilization and handoﬀ delay. The fuzzy-based\
    \ analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is a\nscheme with a full backup property in\
    \ which BC is kept (all the time) with the ongoing operating\nchannel. The bandwidth\
    \ utilization becomes low whenever the handoﬀ delay is at the minimal level.\n\
    STBC and SHCP schemes have the middle course between full backup and no backup\
    \ therefore the\nbandwidth utilization is at an average level while handoﬀ delay\
    \ is minimal. Since the fuzzy-based\nscheme has no BCs, the handoﬀ delay can be\
    \ maximized when the channel underutilization is at its\nminimal level. DFHC [18],\
    \ M/G/1 [21] and Zigbee [52] are reactive handoﬀ schemes with no channel\nbackup\
    \ facility, therefore, the handoﬀ delay is at maximum level and the channel underutilization\
    \ is\nat its minimal level. DSA [53] is a hybrid handoﬀ scheme which is considered\
    \ as a middle course\nbetween proactive and reactive handoﬀ schemes. In DSA, the\
    \ bandwidth utilization is at an average\nlevel, however, the handoﬀ delay can\
    \ be at its maximum level.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1674\n6 of 19\nTable 1. Comparison\

    \ Model\nThe PUTPOSH approach contains the dual handoﬀ modules i.e., proactive\
    \ and reactive.\nThe PUTPOSH scheme permits CRU to detect patterns of PU’s traﬃc\
    \ and select a reactive or proactive\nscheme accordingly. On the arrival of PU,\
    \ CRU may intelligently decide whether to do handoﬀ or wait\nfor an ongoing channel\
    \ by considering the overall service time into account.\nThe PUTPOSH approach\
    \ has the following properties:\n1.\nThe cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is assumed\
    \ to be a time divided system and every CRU\nperforms spectrum sensing in the\
    \ ﬁrst half of every time slot. The actual transmission of the CRU\nis performed\
    \ in the second part of the time slot where the target channel is sensed as idle.\n\
    2.\nWhen the target channel is consumed by a PU, the CRU will perform the actual\
    \ mobility\nmanagement function by considering the waiting on an up-to-date channel\
    \ or shifting its\ncommunication to the new channel.\n3.\nCRNs comprise of autonomous\
    \ channels, where every channel has high and low precedence\nqueues. Every high\
    \ priority queue has served one PU while the lowest precedence queue served\n\
    several SUs on the ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve (FCFS) basis.\n4.\nA handoﬀ decision protocol\
    \ is divided into the transmission and sensing time slots.\nThe\ninterarrival\
    \ of PU is noticed by the cognitive radio user (CRU) in its current channel. It\
    \ ought to\nspend the initial part of every timeslot in monitoring the free channels\
    \ while the communication\nis completed in the second part of the time slot.\n\
    5.\nWhen the multiple unused channels are assessed, the CRUs will choose any vacant\
    \ channel for its\nnext transmission and this random decision is according to\
    \ the uniform distribution. Furthermore,\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1674\n7 of 19\n\
    if no other channel is found to be free, the CRU will wait and stay on its current\
    \ channel until the\nfree channel is available.\n3.2. Framework\nFigure 1 shows\
    \ the proposed primary user traﬃc pattern based opportunistic spectrum handoﬀ\n\
    framework. The proposed design contains three diﬀerent parts; (i) spectrum sensing,\
    \ (ii) spectrum\nmobility management, and (iii) spectrum handoﬀ decision. These\
    \ are connected in Figure 1 and also\ndescribed in the following subsections respectively.\n\

    \ Spectrum Sensing \nIn the spectrum sensing module (Figure 1), the PU movement\
    \ is continually observed by the \nCRU during transmission on the currently occupied\
    \ channel. The spectrum sensing part can be \nachieved by integrating one of the\
    \ existing sensing methods, i.e., matched filter (MF) [15], cooperative \nsensing\
    \ (CS) [16,42] or energy detection (ED) [17,43,44]. In the presented PUTPOSH model,\
    \ the \nenergy detection technique is used in the spectrum sensing part for the\
    \ reason of its working \ndifficulty and for the low computational features [45,46,52].\
    \ It is considered as a generalized approach \nwhen it is compared with the MF\
    \ and CS. In the ED approach, the recipients do not need any \ninformation on\
    \ the PU’s signal [18,53] and the signal is observed by comparing the given threshold\
    \ \nvalue with the energy detector’s output. The threshold value is fixed but\
    \ depends on the earlier \narrival of the PU. The apparent energy stage is increased\
    \ when PU arrives on its licensed band. When \nan energy level’s threshold is\
    \ specified, the apparent energy stage is tested multiple times either in \nthe\
    \ presence and in the absence of the PU. As the power of the arriving signal increases\
    \ than the given \nthreshold, the handoff process is initiated to execute handoff\
    \ actions. \n3.2.2. Spectrum Mobility Management \nThe spectrum mobility management\

    \ upon its \ncommunication requirements and can be of any time period Therefore\
    \ the dwelling period is\nFigure 1. The proposed primary user traﬃc pattern based\

    3.2.2. Spectrum Mobility Management\nThe spectrum mobility management obtains\
    \ the interarrival information of the PU by spectrum\nsensing. The dwelling period\
    \ of a PU is forecasted at the assigned channel with respect to the previous\n\
    waiting behavior. The stopover stay of the PU at the assigned channel depends\
    \ upon its communication\nrequirements and can be of any time period. Therefore\
    \ the dwelling period is assumed and based\nupon the random distribution method\
    \ [18,21]. The decision of either to wait and stay at the ongoing\npath or to\
    \ execute the handoﬀ event is based on the current result. On the one hand, the\
    \ CRU does\nnot make the handoﬀ decision when the PU continued communication for\
    \ shorter intervals of time.\nThe CRU may carry its communication and can wait\
    \ for the ongoing spectrum band. On the other\nhand, the CRU chooses to make a\
    \ handoﬀ decision when PU continued for a longer period at the\nprevious licensed\
    \ band (see Spectrum mobility management module in Figure 1). To allocate vacant\n\
    channels, the waiting time is considered as the overall time of a CRU which can\
    \ be the reason for delay\nin the priority queue. It can be resolved by the M/G/1\
    \ queuing equation for the network model [43,44].\n3.2.3. Spectrum Handoﬀ Decision\n\
    The spectrum handoﬀ decision chooses on a suitable handoﬀ class between reactive\
    \ and proactive\nw.r.t. the lowest overall service time of the CRU. The overall\
    \ service time of the CRU is based on the\nfollowing times: sensing time, processing\
    \ time, waiting time and transmission time. According to\nFigure 1 (in the spectrum\
    \ handoﬀ module), ReA time and PrA time represent the overall service time of\n\
    the reactive and proactive handoﬀ judgments respectively. In this paper, the ReA\
    \ and PrA time values\nare assumed to ﬁnd the threshold and also to compare diﬀerent\
    \ approaches. The overall minimal\nservice time is implemented for the spectrum\
    \ handoﬀ decision. Subsequently, the CRU can maintain\nits transmission on the\
    \ recently selected channel.\nThe Spectrum handoﬀ module in Figure 1 shows that\
    \ the proposed PUTPOSH strategy begins\nwith the recognition of the PU interarrival\
    \ by spectrum sensing and forecasts PU dwelled period in the\nassigned channel.\
    \ Hence in this step, the CRU either dwells on the recent channel or moves into\

    \ scheme.\n4. Simulation Setup and Performance Evaluation\n4.1. Simulation Setup\n\
    The proposed PUTPOSH and some of the existing related approaches were implemented\
    \ and\nsimulated using Matlab. The existing approaches: (1) reactive handoﬀ—DFHC\
    \ [18]—(2) proactive\nhandoﬀ—fuzzy logic-based spectrum handoﬀ (FLSH) [47]—and\
    \ (3) hybrid handoﬀ—DSA [53]—are\nselected to simulate with PUTPOSH. Two diverse\
    \ Poisson procedures are used to produce PUs and\nSUs [20] in the CRN at constant\
    \ time. The overall service time and the inter-arrival time are measured\nas non-integer\
    \ instances of users. The data transfer of the low priority CRUs can be interrupted\
    \ by the\nhigh priority PUs. To avoid the collision of the same priority CRUs\
    \ during the channel access, the ﬁrst\ncome ﬁrst serve scheduling strategy is\
    \ used.\nThe parameters utilized to achieve simulation outcomes are listed in\
    \ Table 2. The simulation was\nexecuted multiple times (generally about 1000 times)\
    \ and the frequent values are taken to plot diﬀerent\ngraphs. We presume the packet\
    \ length of SUs and PUs was 10 bytes for conducting the experiments.\nThe overall\
    \ service time of CRU included the waiting time, the processing time of the channel,\
    \ the data\ntransmission time and the sensing time respectively. The dealing out\
    \ time of the channel is supposed\nto be 0.05 msec [10,12]. The arrival rates\
    \ of PU and CRUs were followed by the Poisson processes.\nFor simplicity, the\
    \ arrival rate value of CRU was ﬁxed to 0.1 and compared with the parameters at\n\
    dissimilar values i.e., 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.08 of PU interarrival\
    \ rates. This disparity\naspect helped us understand the behavior of a CRU in\
    \ the proposed PUTPOSH scheme with various\ninterarrival rates of the PU. Moreover,\
    \ the overall service time of CRU and PU was taken as 0.5 and\n0.4, respectively,\
    \ and the order of the PU was considered a superior precedence than SU. Therefore,\n\
    the overall service time of CRUs depends on the arrival rate of the PU and diﬀerent\
    \ arrival rates of PUs\nmay eﬀect the overall service time.\nThe simulation starts\
    \ with the recognition of a PU by a CRU at a momentarily engaged licensed\nband.\
    \ The CRU may make a decision to ensure a handoﬀ to the next available channel\
    \ or to stay and\nwait at the ongoing channel. The decision of transferring communication\
    \ to a new vacant channel or\nmay waiting in an ongoing channel depends ﬁrmly\
    \ on the service time. When handoﬀ was achieved,\nthe overall service time for\
    \ reactive and proactive decision was considered. With the overall least\nservice\
    \ point, CRU makes the decision to execute reactive or proactive handoﬀ.\nAppl.\

    The eﬃciency of the PUTPOSH approach is observed by considering the following\
    \ attributes:\noverall service time, throughput, number of handoﬀs and channel\
    \ utilization. To achieve comparison\nresults, the proposed handoﬀ technique is\
    \ compared with the DFHC (reactive handoﬀ), FLSH (proactive\nhandoﬀ), and DSA\
    \ (hybrid handoﬀ) approaches.\n4.2.1. PU Detection through Sensing Module\nThe\
    \ probability distribution of PU detection through the sensing module of PUTPOSH\
    \ is shown\nin Figure 5. The energy recognition method is used to sense the PU\
    \ arrival. The detection prospect\ndepends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\
    \ To measure the eﬃciency of any strategy, the detection\nprobability is considered\
    \ an importamt factor. However, the existing techniques in CR did not deliberate\n\

    \ to make sure that\nPUTPOSH works well with the changes in SNR. According to\
    \ Figure 5, the PU recognition probability\nremains lofty with the higher values\
    \ of the SNR (i.e., values larger than 0.8). This is due to the fact that\nenergy\
    \ recognition works proﬁciently well with the superior standards of SNR [37,53].\

    \ and consequently the threshold value of PU interarrival is extracted. With the\

    \ and Hybrid (DSA) Schemes\nA DSA scheme applies proactive spectrum sensing and\
    \ reactive handoﬀ action jointly; ﬁrstly,\nthe target channel selection is prepared\
    \ beforehand or during CRU data transmission and secondly,\nthe spectrum handoﬀ\
    \ is performed after the handoﬀ triggering event. In PUTPOSH, a hybrid solution\n\
    is referred to as “adaptive”, if the decisions of channel selection and handoﬀ\
    \ are made by continuously\nmonitoring the arrival and departure patterns of the\
    \ PU. When PU moves quite regularly, a CRU may\nadapt to a reactive handoﬀ strategy.\
    \ While in the case of rare PU movements, a proactive handoﬀ\nsolution is preferred\
    \ by the corresponding CRU. Figure 11 shows the comparison of the PUTPOSH\nscheme\
    \ with a hybrid approach (DSA) in terms of handoﬀ delay. The graph in Figure 11\
    \ shows that\nthe DSA has more handoﬀ delay than the PUTPOSH scheme because sensing\
    \ is achieved prior to\nthe arrival of the PU whereas the handoﬀ action is performed\
    \ after the PU’s arrival. Therefore the\ncumulative handoﬀ delay of the DSA remains\
    \ high as compared to PUTPOSH. The queuing procedure\nin PUTPOSH adequately reduces\

    \ Handoﬀ is a vital part of the spectrum management process in CRNs. It is the\
    \ method of\nmoving the ongoing communication of a CRU to a vacant channel at\
    \ the arrival of PU without a glitch.\nIn this research, a new handoﬀ (PUTPOSH)\
    \ approach has presented—on the one hand, it maximizes\nthe channel utilization\
    \ and the throughput while on the other hand, it minimizes the overall service\n\
    time and the number of handoﬀs in CRNs. In PUTPOSH, ﬁrstly, an energy detection\
    \ sensing scheme\nwas employed for the announcement of a PU in its licensed spectrum\
    \ band. Secondly, a PUTPOSH\npattern was projected, where a CRU intelligently\
    \ switched between reactive and proactive handoﬀs\ndepending upon the overall\
    \ service time. Hence the presented approach has achieved the aids of both\nproactive\
    \ and reactive schemes. The comparison of the PUTPOSH with the existing proactive,\
    \ reactive\nand hybrid handoﬀ strategies has also conducted. The results show\
    \ that the PUTPOSH approach gets\ngood performance in terms of overall service\
    \ time—having a superior rate than the proactive and 12.8%\nrobust than the reactive\
    \ handoﬀ. In terms of the number of handoﬀs, the PUTPOSH gives 14.28% better\n\
    results than proactive (FLSH), reactive (DFHC) and hybrid (DSA) approaches. The\
    \ PUTPOSH scheme\nproduces 20% better results than the static spectrum access\
    \ and throughput in CRNs. PUTPOSH can\nprofessionally reduce the overall service\
    \ time and the number of fruitless handoﬀs of a CRU while\nkeeping the channel\
    \ busy and the system throughput at the highest level.\nThis work can be extended\
    \ in a number of means; (1) a situation can be considered where a\nCRU can transfer\
    \ its respective data on numerous accessible primary channels concurrently, (2)\
    \ a\nmanagement tool amongst the CRUs retrieving the primary spectrum holes can\
    \ be developed, (3) CRU\ncan interconnect to exchange the information regarding\
    \ the movement of the PU and their stopover as\nwell on a conforming channel to\
    \ make the communication more reliable, and (4) spectrum handoﬀ\nrequires frequent\
    \ spectrum sensing and channel information that takes a signiﬁcant amount of power.\n\
    Hence the energy-eﬃcient spectrum sensing and mobility are still open challenges\
    \ in CRNs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.A.; Data curation, M.K.B.,\

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Spectrum sharing
    is of special significance among all the key technologies in cognitive radio (CR),
    such as spectrum sensing, spectrum management and power allocation etc. Since
    all the efforts in CR directly aim at enhancing spectrum utilization and spectrum
    sharing is the final step of all these key technologies, spectrum sharing completely
    determines whether CR is just a theoretical topic or a practically feasible technology.
    In this paper, a novel spectrum sharing strategy based on the throughput model
    in a cognitive radio network (CRN) is proposed, in which maximum theoretical throughput
    is taken into account on the research of spectrum sharing in CR. And then an optimization
    problem in the form of binary integer linear programming (BILP) to describe this
    model is formulated and a directional search (DS) algorithm to solve this BILP
    problem is designed. Finally, numerical results show that this strategy is quite
    feasible. Published in: 2009 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications,

    I. INTRODUCTION Cognitive radio technology [1] [2] emerges as the times require.
    According to some studies sponsored by FCC, in certain geographical areas, many
    frequency bands, which are regulated by the traditional fixed spectrum allocation
    policy, are not occupied or idle most of the time. But in contrast, rapid development
    of wireless communication technologies is seriously challenged by spectrum scarcity
    problem and lower spectrum utilization. Fortunately, cognitive radio is the right
    technology to sense and interact with its surrounding radio environment, and then
    enables second users (SUs) to access licensed or unlicensed spectrum bands, thus
    this dynamic spectrum access technology can dramatically enhance spectrum utilization.

    radio networks where primary licensed users coexist with unlicensed users, which

    sensing functionality. An analytical framework based on queuing theory and game
    theory is introduced to assess the performance of the spectrum sharing process.
    Queuing theory is used to model the achievable throughput of secondary users,
    whereas game theoretic tools are introduced to capture the competitive dynamics
    of the spectrum sharing process among multiple secondary users. The proposed framework
    is used to derive performance measures of spectrum sharing when spectrum access

    Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) is regarded as a promising technology for providing
    a high spectral efficiency to mobile users by using heterogeneous wireless network
    architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, cognitive radio
    networks (CRNs) may also impose some challenges due to the ever increasing complexity
    of network architecture, the increasing complexity with configuration and management
    of large-scale networks, fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, diverse
    Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of various applications, and the intensifying
    difficulties of centralized control, etc. Spectrum management functions with self-organization
    features can be used to address these challenges and realize this new network
    paradigm. In this paper, fundamentals of CR, including spectrum sensing, spectrum
    management, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing, have been surveyed, with their
    paradigms of self-organization being emphasized. Variant aspects of self-organization
    paradigms in CRNs, including critical functionalities of Media Access Control
    (MAC)- and network-layer operations, are surveyed and compared. Furthermore, new
    directions and open problems in CRNs are also identified in this survey. Published

    Cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum sharing systems use innovative spectrum management
    techniques that allow different systems to share the same frequency band to utilize
    the radio spectrum in an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive
    media access control protocol for cognitive radio networks under the property-rights
    model, in which secondary users are divided into several nonoverlapping groups,
    and each group uses the proposed auction algorithm to bid for required channels
    from the auctioneer appointed by primary users. Simulations indicate that our
    proposed media access control protocol can effectively utilize spectrum resources,
    achieve high system efficiency, and guarantee the fairness of channel allocation
    among groups. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1 INTRODUCTION Over the
    past few years, we have witnessed the rapid proliferation of wireless networks
    in various environments (e.g., home, office and public hotspot). This trend will
    ultimately lead to ubiquitous networking, where not only computers but also ordinary
    electronic devices are connected in a wireless way. However, these large numbers
    of interconnected devices impose huge demands on spectrum resources that have
    almost been allocated to all kinds of other licensed services, the problem of
    spectrum shortage blocks the development of wireless communication. A recent report
    from the Federal Communications Commission Spectrum Policy Task Force in United
    States of America indicates that most of the time, less than 10% of the licensed
    radio spectrum is utilized 1. On the basis of this report, a promising implementation
    technique called cognitive radio, alleviating the scarcity of spectrum bandwidth
    and improving spectrum utilization, was proposed to implement opportunistic and
    dynamic spectrum access 2. The most common approach to cognitive radio often referred
    to as a commons model (unlicensed model) 3 requires secondary users (unlicensed
    users) to first sense the radio environment in search of the vacant channels not
    currently used by primary users (licensed users), and then opportunistically exploit
    the detected transmission opportunities. Another approach to secondary spectrum
    access, sometimes referred to as a property-rights model (exclusive-use model)
    3, under which primary users would ‘own’ their spectrum instead of licensing it,
    thus entitling them to implement different waveforms and subdivide their spectrum
    for resale to secondary spectrum users for a variety of applications including
    opportunistic spectrum use. In practice, the property-rights model is more promising:
    on one hand, as primary users get high rewards, they would like to lease their
    vacant licensed spectrum to more secondary users, the spectrum resources can be
    utilized to the fullest extent; on the other hand, primary users collaborate with
    secondary users to achieve efficient spectrum use. For example, secondary users
    are allowed to continue using the spectrum after detection of primary users for
    a short duration of time before vacating the channel. They may be able to seek
    other potential spectrum opportunities, and hence seize and switch to one of them
    promptly. Our study is based on the property-rights model. Currently, most of
    the proposed cognitive media access control (MAC) protocols 4-8 are based on the
    commons model and are used to address various issues in cognitive networks. They
    pay more attention to saving the number of transceivers, improving throughput
    of the whole system or decreasing session delays. However, all these protocols
    do not put emphasis on maximizing the utilization ratio of spectrum resources
    and guaranteeing the bandwidth requirement of secondary users. In this paper,
    we propose a novel cognitive MAC protocol in which secondary users are divided
    into several nonoverlapping groups, and each group uses the proposed auction algorithm
    to bid for required channels from the auctioneer appointed by the primary users.
    The main merits of the proposed protocol include: (1) maximizing the utilization
    of spectrum resources; (2) achieving revenue maximization for primary users; (3)
    allocating channels among groups fairly and evenly; and (4) considering the bandwidth
    requirement of secondary users, that is, if a group is allocated channels, the
    group''s minimum bandwidth requirement must be satisfied (this characteristic
    is particularly important in the streaming media environment). The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the related work.
    After introducing the system model in 3, the proposed MAC protocol and performance
    analysis are presented in 7 and 14, respectively. In 18, we evaluate the proposed
    protocol''s performance through experiments using the Network Simulator 2 simulator.
    Finally, 24 is devoted to conclusions. 2 RELATED WORK Over the past several years
    there have been increasing interests in cognitive radio, and the wireless MAC
    protocol has taken a principal part in spectrum reuse and efficiency management.
    Various cognitive MAC protocols have been proposed for more flexible and efficient
    use of spectrum resources 4-8. Shin and Hamdaoui 4 proposed the Opportunistic
    Spectrum MAC (OS-MAC) protocol that divides the secondary users into several groups.
    At each Opportunistic Spectrum Period, the channel used by a group can be adjusted
    dynamically according to the channels'' states of the whole system. The OS-MAC
    protocol also discusses the noncooperative mode between primary and secondary
    users, but it does not give a feasible solution. Furthermore, because only one
    channel can be used in a group at anytime, the spectrum resources cannot be used
    to the maximum when taking secondary users'' bandwidth requirements into consideration.
    Jia et al. presented the Hardware-Constrained Cognitive MAC (HC-MAC) protocol
    5 that uses the k-stage look-ahead method to sense unused channels with high efficiency.
    A pair of users can use several channels to communicate simultaneously after they
    detect vacant channels (i.e., bonding/segregation technique). Furthermore, this
    protocol takes hardware constraints into consideration, including sensing constraint
    and transmission constraint. However, if the explored spectrum opportunity is
    more than a secondary user can utilize, it is a waste of bandwidth and will cause
    other secondary users to not gain enough bandwidth. Also, there is a problem called
    the sensing exposed terminal problem in this protocol. That is, if a secondary
    pair senses unused channels while their neighbors who did not receive the Request
    To Send/Clear To Send (C-RTS/C-CTS) packets are performing their operations freely,
    this pair of users cannot sense the vacant channels accurately. Su and Zhang proposed
    the cross-layer based opportunistic MAC protocols (CO-MAC) 6 where two sensing
    policies, the random sensing policy and the negotiation-based sensing policy,
    are presented. Like 5, the protocols also use the bonding/segregation technique
    to transmit data through several channels. In essence, the main contribution of
    their work is to reveal the trade off between throughput and delay, which provides
    the guidelines to support the different QoS requirements over cognitive radio-based
    wireless networks. However, at anytime, only a pair of secondary users can use
    vacant channels, thus the leftover channels cannot be used efficiently. Thoppian
    et al. 7 described a Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)-Based MAC protocol where
    each node maintains a list of favorable channels for each of its neighbors on
    the basis of the previous history of communication on each of the channels, and
    a secondary pair chooses the most favorable channel for communication. Because
    it does not consider the channels'' utility of the whole system, it also cannot
    use the radio spectrum resources efficiently. Carlos and Kiran 8 proposed a cognitive
    MAC (C-MAC) protocol for multichannel wireless networks that operates over multiple
    channels, and hence is able to effectively deal with, among other things, the
    dynamics of resource availability because of primary users. A key concept in C-MAC
    is the use of a dynamic and totally distributed Rendezvous Channel (RC) which,
    among other things, is used to support network-wide multicast and broadcast. However,
    a terminal can only receive or send in one channel at a time, so the vacant channels
    cannot be efficiently used. Additionally, C-MAC does not differentiate between
    the primary users and the secondary users. Similarly, 9-11 all do not address
    the issues of maximizing spectrum resources'' utility of the entire system and
    considering revenue maximization for primary users. 3 SYSTEM MODEL In the following,
    we give a description of the system model. 3.1 Scenario description and assumptions
    We focus on the scenario of a single-hop cognitive radio network that includes
    several nonoverlapping groups. Each group may consist of two or more secondary
    users who want to communicate with each other. At any time, only one member in
    a group can use the assigned channels to transmit information, and the rest in
    the same group will receive/reply to it. In addition, the exchanged information
    can be streaming media resources requiring high continuity, such as music and
    video. Thus, we must take the secondary users'' bandwidth requirement into consideration.
    The rationale behind this group model is to design a MAC that supports not only
    the traditional one-to-one communication sessions, but also the emerging many-to-one
    communication sessions. For example, users (a service provider or a correspondent)
    with the same interest can form a group, and share resources or communicate with
    others. Note that a pair of communicating users can be viewed as a special case
    of a group with two members only. In this paper, assumptions are listed as follows.
    First, each secondary user is equipped with two wireless transceivers. One is
    called data transceiver for sensing vacant data channels (DCs) and exchanging
    data through these channels, but this transceiver is not able to operate in sensing
    and transmitting concurrently. The other transceiver is called a control transceiver
    used for sending or receiving control messages from the control channel (CC).
    Note that CC is provided in advance, and these two transceivers are both half-duplex,
    following the suggestion in 5. Second, all secondary users are distributed in
    a local area wireless network. They can see the same picture of vacant channels
    and has the ability of using aggregated spectrum and full spectrum sensing. Last,
    each user''s transmission range is big enough such that all nodes in the same
    channel can hear the transmitted frames. 3.2 Control mechanism On the basis of
    the distributed environment, secondary users are divided into several nonoverlapping
    groups. Each group has a leader (the leader can be adjusted dynamically) who is
    responsible for members'' management, group channel''s management and communication
    management. Also, an auctioneer, who is appointed by the primary users, is used
    for auctioning vacant channels among leaders through CC. In the cognitive radio
    network, control messages in a group are exchanged through DCs and the traffic
    among groups is transmitted via CC, thus the control channel is lightly loaded
    and will not be the bottleneck of the network. 3.3 Primary users'' network model
    We suppose a radio spectrum consisting of N channels that are licensed to primary
    users (Figure 1). Each channel is time-slotted and its bandwidth is Bi(i = 1, … ,N).
    The occupancy of these N channels follows a discrete-time Markov process with
    2N states. Specifically, the network state in slot t is given by [S1(t), … ,SN(t)],
    where Si(t) ∈ {0(Occupied),1(Idle)}. Let αi be the probability that the ith channel
    state transits from Occupied to Idle and βi be the probability that the ith channel
    state transits from Idle to Occupied. Then, the ith channel utilization for the
    secondary users can be calculated as (1) Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The channel state diagram for primary users. 4 THE PROPOSED COGNITIVE MAC PROTOCOL
    The main goal of our MAC protocol design is to maximize the utilization of spectrum
    resources while achieving revenue maximization for primary users, and take the
    bandwidth requirement of secondary users into consideration. First, we give a
    general description of the proposed MAC protocol. 4.1 General description Figure 2
    shows the principle of our proposed MAC protocol. It can be seen that the time
    axis is divided into a number of Periods and each of which consists of three consecutive
    phases: Announcing Phase, Auction Phase and Communicating Phase. Figure 2 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint The principle of the proposed MAC protocol. Network
    Initialization Phase: If a secondary user is not involved in any group, it will
    listen to CC. Because each existing group periodically broadcasts Invite frames
    on CC, when a user receives Invite frames from the existing groups, it decides
    to join an appropriate one (here we assume that the secondary user has prior knowledge
    about its desired group) and sends a JoinReq frame to the corresponding leader.
    After receiving the responded JoinACK frame, this user tunes its data transceiver
    to the indicated DCs (if the group gains channels). If the secondary user cannot
    find a desired group to join in, it establishes a new group and sends an Invite
    frame on CC. However, if the secondary user cannot receive any Invite frame, it
    knows that it is the only secondary user in the network and establishes a new
    group. Announcing Phase: In this phase, leaders of all groups contend for group
    ids. Suppose the maximal number of groups stipulated by the system is M, thus,
    the value of group id is in the range from 1 to M. Also, only a leader who has
    gained a group id can be assigned vacant channels for its group in the Auction
    phase of the current Period. As depicted in Figure 2, Announcing Phase is divided
    into M slots, in each slot, a group id is contended. Note that the winner in a
    slot cannot be appointed an exact group id until the end of the Announcing Phase.
    As soon as a slot starts, each leader listens to CC and broadcasts a Notify frame,
    which includes the number of group members, using Carrier Sense Multiple Access
    with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) method and binary exponential backoff algorithm.
    Because all leaders share the same control channel, they are able to hear the
    Notify frames from each other. If a leader sends a Notify frame on CC successfully
    in a certain slot, one of the other leaders who is the first to receive this Notify
    frame replies an ACK frame (If some leaders receive a Notify frame concurrently,
    they will use CSMA/CA method and binary exponential backoff algorithm to send
    out an ACK frame on CC) and the remaining leaders need not respond with such ACK
    frames as long as they have heard the existing one; meanwhile, the contention
    in the current slot finishes. Upon receiving an ACK frame before the time expires,
    the sender knows that it has applied for a group id successfully and quits the
    group id contention in Announcing Phase; otherwise, it uses the binary exponential
    backoff mechanism to retry later. In each contention slot, leaders must record
    the winners'' information, and at the end of the Announcing Phase, each winner
    has two tasks to do: first, it calculates all winners'' group id in terms of their
    MAC address (i.e., the winner with the smaller MAC address gets the smaller group
    id, which is numbered from 1 to M); second, it computes the sensing range of the
    radio spectrum for its own group according to the number of members in each group
    (in the rest of this paper, when referring to a group, the group has already gained
    a group id, unless otherwise stated). Auction Phase: Suppose that m (m ⩽ M) groups
    have privileges to communicate in the current Period. These groups will sense
    and be assigned vacant channels in the Auction Phase, which contains three stages.
    In the first stage, each group starts to sense the vacant channels in its spectrum
    range, which is calculated in the Announcing Phase. Moreover, the second stage
    is divided into m slots, each of them corresponds to a group in terms of the group''s
    id. For instance, Slot 1 corresponds to Group 1, and Slot m corresponds to Group
    m. In this stage, each group broadcasts a beacon to report the vacant channels
    (sensed in the first stage) on CC in its corresponding slot. The report process
    enables all groups and the auctioneer to have a larger picture of the whole channels''
    states through their cooperation, because the sensing ability of a group is so
    limited that only a small part of the channels can be checked in a short time.
    In the last stage, each leader has knowledge of all vacant channels, and on the
    basis of the information, it uses the auction algorithm (which will be introduced
    in 12) to bid for required channels from the auctioneer appointed by the primary
    users. Ultimately, each group gains its deserved share of vacant channels and
    utilizes these channels to transfer messages in the Communicating Phase. Communicating
    Phase: In this phase, each group exchanges information through vacant channels
    assigned in the Auction Phase using the channel bonding/aggregation technique.
    Because only one member in a group can use the assigned channels to transmit information
    at any time, these members are served in a round robin manner, and the order is
    appointed according to their ids. In short, the above introduction of four phases
    show the principle of our proposed MAC protocol. In the following subsections,
    we will present this protocol''s major components in detail. 4.2 Election mechanism
    If a leader is crashed, the group members must elect a new leader. In our proposed
    protocol, we use a simple and highly efficient algorithm to realize the election
    mechanism. When any member notices that the leader is not functioning, it broadcasts
    an Election frame in the group to apply for being the new leader. If several members
    detect the leader''s malfunction concurrently, they have to compete for DCs through
    the IEEE 802.11 random access scheme. Under our proposed protocol, in a group,
    the first member to successfully deliver an Election frame is automatically appointed
    as the new leader. Therefore, upon receiving an ACK frame notifying a successful
    reception from any other group member, this member considers itself the new leader.
    Also, the remaining members in the same group will hear the ACK frame, and hence
    will know that someone else has been appointed to be the new leader. Note that
    the election mechanism is very efficient; it exploits the already existing ACK
    mechanism and does not require any extra message exchange, thus incurring no additional
    bandwidth overhead. 4.3 Channel allocation mechanism In the Auction Phase, the
    auctioneer, appointed by the primary users, auctions n vacant channels among m
    groups. Besides getting an income as high as possible, three more objectives must
    be set: (1) maximize the number of groups (m′) that gain channels; (2) maximize
    the utilization of vacant spectrum resources; and (3) consider the bandwidth requirement
    of users. Thus, these objectives can be described as: (2) where ci(i = 1, … ,m′)
    denotes the number of vacant channels allocated to the ith group, bij(j = 1, … ,ci)
    is the bandwidth of the jth channel that is allocated to the ith group (In this
    paper, we assume that channel bandwidths are not the same and they are uniformly
    distributed), and are the minimum and the maximum bandwidth requirement of the
    ith group, respectively. ϵ, a decimal, guarantees the channel allocation is accurate
    and even, and Bk(k = 1, … ,n) denotes the bandwidth of the kth channel. The third
    constraint indicates that the allocated bandwidth to each group must be in a range
    calculated from the minimum and maximum bandwidth requirement of this group, and
    the last constraint demands that the sum of bandwidth allocated to all groups
    cannot exceed the total vacant bandwidth in the system. 4.4 Mapping of the optimal
    problem In this subsection, we highlight the equivalence between the optimal channel
    allocation problem and combinatorial auctions 12 by deriving the mapping between
    the two. When the objective in a market is achieved, such as value maximization
    for a seller (or minimization for a buyer) in auctions, the market is said to
    be in an equilibrium state. This equilibrium corresponds to the optimization problem,
    as defined in 9, where the goods map to the channels and the objective is to satisfy
    2. We formulate the equivalent combinatorial auction problem as follows: Let denote
    the set of goods available for auction and ui(H) is the utility that a seller
    derives if the buyer i acquires the bundle H. The utility can be defined as (3)
    where E is the set of factors determining the utility ui(H), we is the weight
    for a given factor e, and . The item Vi,e(H) is the value of the factor e by allocating
    the bundle H to buyer i. We define as (4) Thus, the corresponding combinatorial
    auction can be formulated as (5) where is the set of groups that gain channels.
    The first condition ensures that the overlapping sets of items are never assigned,
    whereas the second one indicates that no buyer obtains more than one subset. A
    careful observation of 5 reveals that the formulation is identical to the system
    objective problem defined in 2, and finding the solution to 5 is known as the
    winner determination problem 13. In 14, Johan Hastad pointed out that solving
    the winner determination problem is shown to be an Non-deterministic Polynomial
    (NP)-complete problem and cannot even be approximated to a ratio of γ1−ε in polynomial
    time, where γ is the total number of users. We therefore propose a new auction
    algorithm that has an approximation ratio of ( 1 + log n) to the optimal solution,
    in 12. 4.5 Unit price function In this subsection, we introduce the unit price
    function that will be used in our devised auction algorithm. In a round of bidding,
    each leader decides the bid price according to the bandwidth needed and the unit
    price (quantified by the price per Mbps) it is able to afford. Here, for the ith(i = 1, … ,m)
    group, we define a metric, hungry degree (δi), to reflect the degree that this
    group starves for bandwidth (6) where ti(i = 1, … ,m) denotes the number of vacant
    channels allocated to the ith group in the previous rounds of bidding. For a leader,
    its decided unit price partly depends on the current hungry degree, which guarantees
    that the ‘hungry’ group bids with high price and obtains the required vacant channels
    as soon as possible. Group i''s unit price is characterized by an increasing function
    Ui(δi,θi), where θi is a group-dependent parameter. The choice of a utility function
    is not unique. It must be selected to describe the unit price rule for the group''s
    bidding, and also to have appealing mathematical properties that could fit the
    trend of unit price varied with hungry degree. In practical application, the shape
    of the utility function is approximated as increasing and concave. The concavity
    is justified by the fact that a group that purchases more bandwidth would like
    to provide slowly increasing unit price, that is, the seller gives some preferences
    to the buyer who purchases more bandwidth. Thus, the chosen utility function is
    demanded to reflect that the increment of unit price is decreasing as the hungry
    degree is increasing. As a particular example, we have studied and proposed a
    utility function, Ui(δi,θi) = θiln(δi + 1), which is able to accurately depict
    the variation of unit price with the change of hungry degree. However, the unit
    price remains zero in case the bandwidth allocated to the ith group exceeds its
    maximum requirement; that is, even for nonzero δi, the unit price is zero if δi < 0.
    This can be justified by the fact that if a group''s maximum bandwidth requirement
    has been satisfied, the group will not bid for any other available channel. Obviously,
    it reflects the first objective of our algorithm design, because less vacant channels
    are wasted, these channels can be assigned to more groups. Formally, we define
    the unit price function for Group i as follows: (7) As depicted in Figure 3, the
    domain of the unit price function is divided into two different regions, [ −ϵ,
    0] and (0, 1]. We call region (0, 1] as active region, in which the change of
    the function is prominent. With the increment of hungry degree, the leader increases
    its provided unit price to bid for leasing the vacant channels. In the region
    [ −ϵ, 0], the group''s maximum bandwidth requirement has been satisfied already,
    the leader need not bid for any available channel, thus, the unit price of bandwidth
    is set zero. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The curve of the unit price
    function. 4.6 Channel auction algorithm On the basis of combinatorial auction,
    we develop a novel auction called self-service auction, which can be expressed
    as: in a round of auction, there are multiple leaders intending to procure channels
    from an auctioneer; each of the leaders selects and bids for its needed vacant
    channels, and the auctioneer, eventually, permits the purchase requirement of
    one leader who pays its selected channels with maximum unit price, which is quantified
    by the price per Mbps. In each Period, the auctioneer auctions n vacant channels
    among m groups. Considering the application background and the objective of our
    research, the whole algorithm is decoupled into two miniphases. In the first miniphase,
    by using self-service auction, we assign part of the vacant channels to m′(m′⩽
    m) groups to satisfy their minimum bandwidth requirements (these groups are called
    active groups in the paper). That is, channels are allocated to as many groups
    as possible while requiring that only each group''s minimum requirement can be
    satisfied. Obviously, it reflects the first and the third objective of our channel
    auction. During the second miniphase, the residual channels, which cannot satisfy
    the minimum bandwidth requirement of any additional group in the first miniphase,
    are allocated among the active groups using the standard forward auction 15. This
    just mirrors the second design objective: maximize the utilization of vacant spectrum
    resources. The detailed algorithm is depicted in Pseudo Code 1. The pseudocode
    from line 1 to line 17 describes the first miniphase of our proposed channel auction
    algorithm. In this miniphase, multiple single-round auctions are held until no
    additional leader is able to get a bundle of channels that satisfies this leader''s
    minimum bandwidth requirement. In each round, leader i is allowed to provide a
    bid for only one bundle of channels , where represents a channel in the system
    and ni is the total number of channels in Ai. The auctioneer checks all bids and
    allocates the bundle of channels Ai to leader i if the price per bandwidth (unit
    price) paid by this leader is higher than others (if two leaders provide bids
    with the same unit price, the one whose group id is smaller wins). At the end
    of each round of bidding, the auctioneer sends back the results of the current
    round on CC, and the channels that have been sold out will not be chosen by any
    bidder in the subsequent auctions. If a leader has been successfully assigned
    a bundle of channels in a round, it will stop bidding in the rest of the first
    miniphase. In pseudocode 1, we define three sets: soldChannelSet, oneRoundBidSet
    and activeLeaderSet. The set soldChannelSet denotes the set of bundles of channels
    {Ai} i ∈ {1,2, … ,m′}that have been allocated to leaders, oneRoundBidSet shows
    the set of bids in a round of bidding, and activeLeaderSet expresses the set of
    leaders {gi} i ∈ {1,2, … ,m′}, each of whom has already gained a bundle of channels
    (we call these leaders as active leaders). We also use s to denote an attribute
    of a channel, defined as whether the channel has been assigned to a leader; if
    so, set the attribute OCCUPIED, otherwise, AVAILABLE value is set. is the supplementary
    set of activeLeaderSet, it consists of the leaders who have not been allocated
    any channel. The pseudocode from line 18 to line 28 describes the second miniphase
    of the channel auction algorithm. In this miniphase, the intended auctioned channels
    are not decided by each leader but by the auctioneer. The channels that are not
    allocated to any leader in the first miniphase are auctioned one by one among
    the leaders in activeLeaderSet, that is, an active leader can only gain a channel
    in a round of bidding of this miniphase. Specially, each active leader is appointed
    a priority value (the initial value is 1), and in a round of bidding for a certain
    channel, the one with the highest priority wins the bidding and its priority value
    is set to half of the current value. However, if several leaders have the same
    priority, the one who bids with the highest price wins (if two leaders provide
    the same price, the one whose group id is smaller wins). By using this mechanism,
    the residual channels can be allocated among all active leaders fairly and evenly.
    5 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS In this section, we concentrate on analyzing the system
    performance, focusing on three metrics: throughput, system efficiency, and bandwidth
    usage. To analyze the whole system''s performance, we must study the three phases
    respectively, and the Announcing Phase is the focal point of our research. In
    the analysis, we assume the channel condition is ideal (i.e., no hidden terminals
    and capture 16). 5.1 Announcing Phase We study the behavior of a single group
    with a Markov model, which is modified from the bidimensional Markov process proposed
    in 17, and get the probability(τ) of the group successfully contends for a group
    id in a slot. We adopt an exponential backoff scheme in this phase. At each frame
    transmission, the backoff time is uniformly chosen in the range (0,W −1). The
    value W is called contention window (CW), and depends on the number of failed
    transmissions for the frame. At the first transmission attempt, W is set equal
    to a value CWmin called minimum contention window. After each unsuccessful transmission,
    W is doubled, up to the maximum contention window CWmax. In the Announcing Phase,
    M′ leaders contend for m group ids (the maximal number of group ids stipulated
    by the system is M). A leader who wants to gain a group id for its group waits
    until CC is sensed idle for a Distributed InterFrame Space, follows the backoff
    rules and then transmits a Notify frame. One of the other leaders who received
    a Notify frame responds with an ACK frame after a Short InterFrame Space. Both
    Notify and ACK frames'' lengths are fixed. Therefore, every leader, by detecting
    just one frame among the Notify and ACK frames, can delay transmissions by an
    appropriate amount, thus avoiding collisions. On the basis of these assumptions,
    we use a discrete-time bidimensional Markov process (s(t),b(t)) to evaluate the
    throughput in the Announcing Phase. The random process b(t) represents the backoff
    counter of each leader, and s(t) is used to denote the size of the contention
    window from which b(t) is drawn. In Figure 4, (k + 1) different backoff stages
    are considered (including the 0th stage). The maximum contention window size is
    CWmax = 2k (in this paper, CWmin = 1, CWmax = 1024), and the relation Wi = 2i
    is used to define the ith contention window size. A Notify frame can be transmitted
    only in the (i,0) state. If the transmission is successful, the contention for
    group id in the current slot finishes, and the rest of the (M′−1) leaders will
    start a new contention in the next slot. However, if collision occurs, the backoff
    stage is incremented, so that the new state can be (i+ 1,j), j ∈ [0,Wi+1 −1],
    with probability Pc∕Wi+1 (Pc is the collision probability), because a uniform
    distribution between the states in the same backoff stage is considered. Moreover,
    if a collision occurs in the (k,0) state, the next state will be (k,j), j ∈ [0,Wk
    −1]. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Markov chain model for the backoff
    window size. The Markov process of Figure 4 is governed by the following transition
    probabilities ‡: (8) The first equation in 8 states that, at the beginning of
    each contention-slot (a slot in Announcing Phase includes a great many contention-slots),
    the backoff time is decremented. The second equation accounts for the fact that
    if any leader successfully sends a Notify frame, the contention for group id in
    the current slot finishes, thus the state moves to the end state with probability
    1 −Pc. The following two equations model the system after an unsuccessful transmission.
    In particular, as considered in the third equation, when an unsuccessful transmission
    occurs at backoff stage i−1, the backoff stage increases, and the new initial
    backoff value is uniformly chosen in the range [0,Wi −1]. Finally, the last case
    models the fact that once the backoff stage reaches the value k, it is not increased
    in subsequent frame transmissions. Let di,j = limt → ∞ P{s(t) = i,b(t) = j}, ∀ i ∈ [0,k], ∀ j ∈ [0,Wi
    −1], be the probability of a leader occupying a given state at any discrete time.
    To simplify the evaluation of the normalization condition of the bidimensional
    Markov chain, all the probabilities di,j are expressed as a function of d0,0.
    First, note that (9) Because of the chain regularities, for each j ∈ [0,Wi −1],
    it is (10) By relations 9 and 10, all the values di,j are expressed as functions
    of the value b0,0. Employing the normalization condition, we can get (11) The
    normalization condition yields the following equation for computation of d0,0:
    (12) We then compute τ, the probability that a leader starts a transmission in
    a randomly chosen contention-slot time. Because any transmission occurs when the
    backoff time counter is equal to zero, we have (13) To find the value of Pc, it
    is sufficient to note that the probability Pc that a transmitted frame encounters
    a collision, is the probability that, in a contention-slot, at least one of the
    M′−1 remaining leaders transmit. The Pc can be calculated as follows: (14) Equations 13
    and 14 represent a nonlinear system in two unknown variables τ and Pc, which can
    be solved using the numerical technique. It is easy to prove that this system
    has a unique solution. Because (M′−i+ 1), i ∈ [1,m] leaders contend for a group
    id in the ith slot, and in a contention-slot, each of them sends a Notify frame
    with probability τ; the probability that there is at least one transmission is
    derived as (15) The probability that exactly one leader transmits successfully
    on the channel, conditioned on the fact that at least one leader transmits, can
    be shown as (16) The system efficiency of Announcing Phase, which is defined as
    the ratio of the frames that are successfully transmitted to all frames used to
    contend for group ids, can be presented as follows: (17) where Ti, Tc and Ts are
    the duration the channel is idle, the average time in which CC is sensed busy
    because of a collision, and the successful Notify frame transmission time, respectively.
    In the Announcing Phase, the data quantity of successful transmissions is (18)
    where E[LNotify] and E[LAck] are the length of Notify frame and ACK frame respectively.
    According to Equations 17 and 18, we can get the total transmission load in the
    Announcing Phase (19) 5.2 Auction Phase This phase is divided into three stages.
    In the first stage, all groups sense for vacant channels and no communications
    traffic is produced. The secondary stage includes m slots. In each slot, a leader
    broadcasts a beacon frame to report the vacant channels detected by its group.
    The traffic load in the stage is mE[LBeacon], where E[LBeacon] is the length of
    the beacon frame. The last stage is for auctioning all vacant channels among leaders.
    We detail the analysis in the following part because of the complexity. As introduced
    in 7, the last stage using channel allocation algorithm is decoupled into two
    miniphases. In the first miniphase, channels are allocated to m′ groups while
    requiring that each group only obtains the minimum bundle of channels it demanded.
    In a bidding, if bundles of channels chosen by m′ leaders do not overlap mutually,
    just one round of bidding is needed. In the worst case, if all bundles in each
    round are conflicting, m′ rounds are required. The number of cases in which the
    first miniphase finishes during i, i ∈ [1,m′] round(s) can be expressed as (20)
    In a bidding round i, the minimum and maximum number of bid frames that leaders
    send to the auctioneer are computed as follows: (21) (22) Because the bid frame
    quantities in all cases of bidding round i distribute between and evenly, the
    average bid frame number in round i can be figured from Equations 21 and 22 (23)
    From Equations 20 and 23, we obtain the average data quantity in the first miniphase
    (24) where E[LBid] and E[LAck] are the average length of a bid frame from a leader
    and an acknowledgement frame from the auctioneer when a bid is accepted, respectively.
    Suppose that there are N licensed channels and all these channels have the same
    channel utilization with respect to the primary users. From 1, we can present
    the channel utilization η for secondary users as (25) Then we calculate the average
    number of vacant channels that can be used for secondary users in a Period as
    (26) During the second miniphase, the channels that are not allocated to any leader
    in the first miniphase are auctioned one by one among m′ leaders. In this analysis,
    we assume that all channel''s bandwidths are not the same and they are uniformly
    distributed. The number of residual channels is presented as follows: (27) Similar
    with Equation 24, we obtain the average data quantity in the second miniphase
    (28) From the above analysis, the total transmission load in the Auction Phase
    can be computed as (29) 5.3 Communicating Phase In this phase, each group exchanges
    information through vacant channels assigned in the Auction Phase. The total payload
    is (30) where Tcp is the time elapsed during the Communicating Phase. Up to this
    time, we have computed the traffic load of three phases respectively. The final
    step in the analysis is to calculate the throughput ϕ, efficiency λ, and bandwidth
    usage σ of the entire system. The system throughput ϕ, defined as the fraction
    of time the radio spectrum is used to successfully transmit payload bits in a
    Period, can be calculated as follows: (31) where, Tp is the time elapsed during
    a Period. System efficiency λ is the ratio of the successfully transmitted payload
    frames to all frames exchanged in the system, that is (32) The metric bandwidth
    usage σ reflects whether users can use the whole system''s spectrum resources
    to the maximum. With higher value of σ, the protocol is more efficient (33) where
    Bcc is the bandwidth of the CC. Note that, in the above computation of the metrics,
    for simplicity, we do not consider the communications traffic of the Network Initialization
    Phase, transmission error, and group control. However, we take these factors into
    consideration in conducting the simulation. 6 SIMULATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
    In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol via simulation
    using Network Simulator 2 18. We randomly deploy 25 static equivalent (with the
    same radio capabilities) secondary user nodes and 1 auctioneer node in a 250 m
    ×250 m area, and we set the radio range as 372.214 m according a typical 2.4 GHz
    radio configuration. The available frequency band, within the range of 20 MHz ∼ 2.4 GHz,
    has an aggregated bandwidth of 35 Mbps ∼ 45 Mbps and is divided into 30 available
    DCs. Also, a 2 Mbps common CC is appointed. In the simulations, we only simulate
    saturated Constants Bit Rate (CBR) traffic to evaluate system performance without
    impacts from transport protocols. The unit price function Ui(δi,θi) = θiln(δi
    + 1) is used and θi(i = 1, … ,m) is equal to 10 for all groups. Under each round
    of bidding in the first miniphase, every leader randomly chooses one bundle of
    channels that can only satisfy its group''s minimum bandwidth requirement and
    bids for these channels. The parameters used are presented in Table 1. Table 1.
    Parameters used in the simulations. Parameter Value Number of secondary user groups
    (M) 5, 8 Number of DCs 30 Bandwidth of each DC (not the same) 1 ∼ 1.5 Mbps Minimum
    bandwidth requirement of each group 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps Maximum bandwidth requirement
    of each group 6 Mbps Length of packets 1024 Bytes Transmit power 0.01 W Adjusting
    factor (ϵ) 0.1¶ In the simulation, the proposed MAC protocol is compared with
    the following existing MACs: OS-MAC [4] and CO-MAC [6]. For conciseness, we define
    the vacant channels'' percentage in the entire system as pn = n∕N. 6.1 Throughput
    evaluation In this subsection, we compare the throughput of our proposed protocol
    with those of the other two protocols: OS-MAC and CO-MAC. The throughput allows
    us to evaluate the protocols'' performance in terms of the payload bits transmitted
    in a given time. Figure 5 shows the throughput comparison under different network
    scenarios. In Figure 5(a) the number of secondary user groups (m) is 5, and in
    Figure 5(b) m equals to 8. First note that with the increase of vacant channels''
    percentage (pn), the system throughput of these three protocols all increases.
    Also, observe that the throughput of the proposed MAC protocol increases sharply
    while CO-MAC attains a bound rapidly and OS-MAC increases little after reaching
    a fixed value. This demonstrates that our proposed protocol can sufficiently utilize
    the vacant channels with the increment of pn. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The throughput with different number of vacant channels. In OS-MAC, because only
    one channel can be used by a group and all channel''s bandwidths are uniformly
    distributed between 1 Mbps and 1.5 Mbps, when each group monopolizes a channel
    (i.e., this group does not share the channel with other groups), the overall throughput
    will not increase much with the increment of pn but with the number of secondary
    user groups (m). For example, in Figure 5(a), the system throughput of OS-MAC
    in pn = 40% is a little higher than that in pn = 30%, because with the increasing
    of pn, although each group cannot gain another channel, it has more opportunity
    to switch to a ‘best’ one. Moreover, in Figure 5(b), the throughput of OS-MAC
    is much higher than the counterpart in Figure 5(a), because more vacant channels
    are utilized by groups as m is increasing. In CO-MAC, because only a pair of secondary
    users uses multiple vacant channels at anytime and each pair''s required maximum
    bandwidth is the same in our experiment, as soon as the required maximum bandwidth
    is satisfied, the entire throughput will not be changed. Another point that requires
    attention is that, in Figure 5(a), the curve represented for the system throughput
    of the proposed MAC protocol is close to a fixed value when pn = 80%. This is
    because all groups'' maximum bandwidth requirements are satisfied in this case;
    the throughput of the entire system reaches an upper bound and more vacant channels
    are not needed (if we continue to allocate vacant channels to these groups, the
    channels are wasted). We also compare the throughput of the analytical value with
    the simulation value. From Figures 5(a) and (b), we can see that the curve represented
    for the analytical value is above the curve of the simulation value, because the
    theoretical analysis does not consider the communications traffic of the Network
    Initialization Phase, transmission error, and group control. 6.2 System efficiency
    evaluation We now evaluate the performance in terms of system efficiency defined
    as the ratio of the frames that are successfully transmitted to all delivered
    frames. The proposed MAC protocol is compared with IEEE 802.11b MAC protocol to
    evaluate this metric more intuitively. We have developed a simple 802.11b simulator
    that simulates the CSMA/CA access method with five nodes under heavy load. Each
    node''s bit rate is 11 Mbps and the length of a data frame is 1024 Bytes. All
    the other parameters such as CWmin, CWmax, and SLOT have values defined in the
    802.11b standard. Figure 6 depicts the system efficiency for our proposed MAC
    protocol and 802.11b MAC protocol against a different number of vacant channels
    (pn). As shown in this figure, when pn is small, the system efficiency of the
    proposed MAC protocol increases sharply with the increment of pn, and as pn exceeds
    30%, all curves decline slowly and the average value is around 60%. Upon comparing
    these curves, it is shown obviously that the proposed protocol outperforms the
    802.11b MAC protocol, because less conflicts occur in the workings of our proposed
    protocol; the system efficiency can be improved significantly. We also observe
    that, in contrast with m = 5, our proposed protocol with m = 8 shows higher average
    system efficiency. Also, this efficiency will become very low if the number of
    groups (m) is too large because of more conflicts among groups. Thus, it is important
    to choose an appropriate M to achieve high system efficiency according to the
    practical application situation. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The
    system efficiency with different pn. The simulation results are also compared
    with the analytical results in Figure 6. It is clear that the system efficiency
    of the simulation value is lower than that of the analytical value, because the
    practical wireless communication contains more conflicts, and the Radio Frequency
    (RF) interference and attenuation also greatly affect the whole system''s efficiency.
    Furthermore, we notice that the curve represented for m = 8 is first under the
    curve represented for m = 5 and then above it. This can be explained by the fact
    that, at the beginning, the system of m = 8 produces more conflicts compared with
    the system of m = 5 while bandwidth resources can be fully used under both scenarios.
    However, with the increment of pn, the system of m = 5 cannot efficiently utilize
    all vacant bandwidths, thus, the system efficiency of m = 8 is higher than that
    of m = 5. 6.3 Bandwidth usage evaluation In this subsection, the proposed MAC
    protocol is compared with OS-MAC and CO-MAC. Figure 7 shows the bandwidth usage
    (σ) of the three MAC protocols with the change of vacant channels'' quantity (pn)
    under different network scenarios. In Figure 7(a) the number of secondary user
    groups (m) is 5, and in Figure 7(b) m equals to 8. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Group throughput with different pn in our proposed protocol. From this
    figure, three observations can be made. First, the vacant channels'' usage (σ)
    of the proposed MAC protocol is almost 100% before all groups'' maximum bandwidth
    requirements are satisfied, while the σ of other two protocols decreases with
    the increase of pn. Second, we find that, in our proposed MAC protocol, users
    utilize the vacant channels to their fullest extent and conduct high channel usage.
    However, the vacant channels usage (σ) of OS-MAC drops rapidly with pn because
    of the utilization of a fixed number of vacant channels except for the increment
    of m. Third, in Figure 7(a), the curve represented for σ under the proposed MAC
    protocol declines quickly after pn = 80% caused by the satisfaction of all groups''
    maximum bandwidth requirements, and unlike CO-MAC, with the increment of pn, part
    of the unused channels will not be occupied by some secondary users whose bandwidth
    requirements are already satisfied, thus these channels are able to be allocated
    to other users who need them. This is an important feature that we will evaluate
    in 22. Note that, the σ of the simulation results are the same as the analytical
    results, because the practical channel allocation adopts the algorithm in theory.
    6.4 Fairness evaluation Now, we investigate the fairness of our proposed protocol.
    Figure 8 presents each group''s throughput against the different number of vacant
    channels (pn = 30%, pn = 60% and pn = 90%) with the number of groups (m) being
    5. In Figure 8(a) the required minimum bandwidth of each group (Rmin) is 1 Mbps,
    and Rmin equals to 2 Mbps in Figure 8(b). Commonly, the throughput comparison
    of all groups with certain pn reflects the fairness of the whole system, and the
    comparison of certain group''s throughput with different pn shows the dynamics
    of resource allocation. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Group throughput
    with different pn in our proposed protocol. In Figure 8, we observe that with
    certain pn, the throughput of each group is much closer. Especially when pn is
    90%, the groups'' throughputs are almost the same as shown in Figure 8(a). This
    really presents the fairness of our propose protocol. We also see that the throughput
    of a certain group increases monotonically with the increment of pn. For instance,
    in Figure 8(b), the throughput of Group2 rises from 3.294 Mbps to 3.88 Mbps as
    pn increases from 60% to 90%. Thus, the vacant spectrum resources are able to
    allocated among groups dynamically as the vacant channels increase. Note that
    the throughput of Group1 is 0 Mbps in Figure 8(b) when pn = 30%. The reason is
    that, in this case, the number of vacant channels is very small and the required
    minimum bandwidth of each group (Rmin) is relatively high; just part of the groups
    that provide higher bids can gain the vacant channels. As mentioned above, we
    can claim that our proposed MAC protocol guarantees the fairness and dynamics
    of channels allocation for groups. 6.5 Ratio of wasted bandwidth evaluation Another
    important metric to evaluate the system performance is the ratio of wasted bandwidth,
    defined as the fraction of bandwidths allocated to secondary users, which are
    wasted, as some users'' maximum bandwidth requirements have already been satisfied.
    For example, Group1 is allocated 8 Mbps bandwidth. In fact, only 6 Mbps bandwidth
    is enough to accommodate the maximum bit rate of this group, thus 2 Mbps bandwidth
    is wasted and cannot be used by other groups whose maximum bandwidth requirements
    have not been satisfied. Figure 9 plots the wasted bandwidth against the number
    of vacant channels (pn) with different Rmin, and m = 5. From this figure, we observe
    that when pn is smaller than 70%, our proposed protocol uses all allocated vacant
    bandwidths to transfer information, because in this scenario all groups'' maximum
    bandwidth requirements are not satisfied and every vacant channel is utilized
    efficiently. When pn surpasses 80%, because part of the groups'' maximum bandwidth
    requirements have been satisfied, a fraction of the allocated vacant bandwidth
    may be wasted. However, as shown in Figure 9, the wasted bandwidths in our proposed
    MAC protocol are less than 10%; therefore, high spectrum resource usage is achieved.
    Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Ratio of wasted bandwidth with different
    pn. Note that, through rough calculation, the total delay of the competition in
    announcing and auction phases is far less than 45 ms. Therefore, compared with
    the time used for users'' communication, this delay can be ignored. 7 CONCLUSION
    In this paper, we have proposed a novel cognitive MAC protocol for cognitive radio
    networks under the property-rights model. The objective of this protocol is to
    maximize the utilization ratio of spectrum resources while achieving revenue maximization
    for primary users, and take the bandwidth requirement of secondary users into
    consideration. On the basis of the combinatorial auction principle, we have devised
    a new auction algorithm that has an approximation ratio of ( 1 + log n) to the
    optimal solution, to solve the optimization problem (Non-deterministic Polynomial
    (NP)-complete). We have also used the Markov chain to compute the transmission
    load in the Announcing Phase and further analyze the whole system''s performance.
    Simulation results indicate that our proposed MAC protocol can effectively utilize
    spectrum resources, achieve high system efficiency and low ratio of wasted bandwidth,
    and guarantee the fairness of channel allocation among groups. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Cognitive radio technology is an emerging technology for the efficient use of
    radio spectrum. Spectrum sharing is the important function in spectrum management
    in cognitive radio network. In this paper a spectrum sharing scheme is proposed,
    in which there are two primary users and multiple secondary users who share frequency
    spectrum with the primary users. A continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) analysis
    model is presented to derive the statistics of the proposed scheme. Numeric experiments

    Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction The emergence of new bandwidth hungry
    technologies and the rapid growth of wireless communication services have created
    huge demand of radio spectrum. The radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource
    and to fulfill the growing demands of the emerging technologies, efficient and
    effective utilization of radio spectrum is essential. The traditional policy of
    fixed spectrum allocation shows disgusting findings from a number of measurement
    studies of spectrum occupancy measurement by the FCC Spectrum Policy task force
    [1]. These studies reveal that a large portion of the allocated spectrum is used
    sporadically and geographical variations in the utilization of assigned spectrum
    ranges from 15% to 85% with a high variation in time [2]. In order to fully utilize
    the scarce spectrum, with the development of cognitive radio technology, dynamic
    spectrum sharing is a promising approach to increase the spectrum utilization.
    Cognitive radio (CR) has the ability to sense the information from its radio environment.
    Based on interaction with the environment, cognitive radio enables the secondary
    users to communicate over the most appropriate spectrum bands. As the most of
    the radio spectrum is already assigned to the licensed users (primary user) by
    the governmental policies, cognitive radios mainly search for the communication
    over the vacant licensed spectrum band. Thus the cognitive radios exploit the
    temporally and geospatially unused spectrum which is defined as the spectrum hole
    or white space [3]. By sensing and adapting to the environment, a CR is able to
    occupy in the spectrum holes and serve its users without causing harmful interference
    to the PU. To do so, the CR must continuously sense the spectrum it is using in
    order to detect the reappearance of the PU. Once the PU is detected, the CR must
    withdraw from the spectrum so as to minimize the interference it may be cause
    to the PU. The cognitive radio technology enables the users to opportunistically
    access the available licensed through four main functionalities required: (i)
    spectrum sensing, (ii) spectrum managing, (iii) spectrum mobility and (iv) spectrum
    sharing [2]. The spectrum sharing is one of the most important functions in cognitive
    radio, which allows cognitive radio to fairly share the available spectrum bands
    among the coexisting cognitive radios. Dynamic spectrum sharing is extensively
    investigated by the research community. A primary system prioritized Markov approach
    for dynamic spectrum access is examined through modeling the interactions between
    the primary users and the secondary users as continuous time Markov chains in
    paper [4]. It achieves a good statistical tradeoff between spectrum efficiency
    and fairness. A Markov chain analysis for spectrum access in licensed bands for
    cognitive radios is presented in [5] and forced termination probability, blocking
    probability and traffic throughput are derived. In [6], quality-of-service (QoS)
    performance in a Cognitive radio system involving primary and secondary users
    was analyzed by using a Markov chain. In [7] a continuous-time Markov model is
    investigated for dynamic spectrum access in open spectrum wireless networks. A
    spectrum sharing scheme using one PU and multiple SUs is presented in [8] for
    which the mean number of radio bands used by secondary users, blocking rate of
    secondary users, deprivation rate of secondary users and utilization of secondary
    users are derived. A spectrum sharing scheme is proposed in which there is two
    primary users and multiple secondary users. We have investigated the fundamental
    spectrum sharing scheme in which two primary users and multiple secondary users
    coexist in cognitive radio network. There are two frequency bands of primary users
    divided into multiple radio bands and each secondary user can access any radio
    band if the licensed band is not used primary users. We have proposed a spectrum
    sharing scheme along with the CTMC analysis model. Also we got some important
    statistics such as mean number of radio bands used by the second users, deprivation
    rate and blocking rate of the secondary users, and the utilization ratio of the
    spectrum. The rest of the paper is outlined as follows: the spectrum sharing scheme
    along with the CTMC analysis model is proposed in section II, in which some statistics
    of the proposed scheme is derived. Some numeric experiments are presented in section
    III. The conclusion of this work is presented in IV. SECTION II. The Spectrum
    Sharing Scheme In a Cognitive Radio Network, there are two types of users, the
    primary users (PUs) and the secondary users (SUs), operating in the same radio
    frequency spectrum. PUs are licensed users where as SUs are unlicensed users.
    The Primary users have legacy for exclusive use of the frequency spectrum. In
    the proposed spectrum sharing scheme we consider there are two licensed frequency
    bands f x and f y , licensed to PUl and PU2 respectively. Each band is divided
    into N sub-bands, as shown in Fig.1, by means of Orthogonal Frequency Division
    Multiplexing technology. This scheme which has two PUs is considered in view to
    extend the model for multiple PUs and SUs. So the 2N SUs are allowed to use the
    sub-bands in parallel when the spectrum is not used by the PUs. All the SUs have
    to stop the use of their respective radio bands and vacate the bands when the
    PUs comes back to use the spectrum. We assume that each SU is set with a cognitive
    radio device to detect presence of the PU so that the band it used is vacated
    before the PU starts using the spectrum and in the meantime the PU is not aware
    of the existence of the SUs. Fig 1. Spectrum Sharing Scheme Show All The statistics
    of the proposed spectrum sharing scheme is given below. The following assumptions
    are for deriving the statistics (i) The arrival of the PU to access the spectrum
    is a Poisson process with rate λ p , i.e., the inter accessing time is negative-exponentially
    distributed with mean time 1/ λ p (ms); (ii) The time of the PU occupying the
    spectrum is a random variable is a random variable that obeys a negative-exponential
    distribution with mean time 1/ μ p (ms); (iii) The inter-arrival time of SUs accessing
    the spectrum is a random variable that obeys a negative-exponentially distributed
    with mean time 1/ λ s (ms); and (iv) The time of each SU using a radio band is
    a random variable obeying negative-exponential distribution with mean 1/ μ s (ms).
    The exponential distribution and CTMC are both memory less. The negative-exponential
    distribution of the random variables representing inter-arrival times and services
    times are considered so as to be suitable for CTMC. Besides, we assume that each
    SU is able to use all the N bands but only uses one of the bands every time. The
    time for a SU to vacate a band is ignored. The time of SUs'' using a band remains
    negative-exponentially distributed no matter whether the SUs are forced to stop
    by the PU or not. This is because negative-exponential distribution possesses
    memory less property as mentioned earlier. Let XO stand for the state that neither
    primary nor secondary user uses the spectrum. Xl and X2 are the states when one
    PU is exclusively using one of two spectral bands and when both of the bands are
    used by two PUs respectively. Si represent the state that there are i SUs using
    bands (;=1,2…..2N) . In addition, we use C to denote the set of states, i.e.,
    C={XO,X1,X2 S 1 … S 2N } . Thus, the state transitions are depicted in Fig. 2.
    It is intuitive that no SUs more than 2N can occupy the spectrum since the available
    sub-bands can only be 2N . From the basic queuing theory applied to CTMC, the
    following balance equations for the model can be derived. Π j are steady state
    probabilities of states S j and Π x0 ,  Π x1 and Π x2 are steady state probabilities
    of states XO, Xl, and X2 respectively. Fig 2. The CTMC model for two PU and 2N

    III. Numeric Experiments In the numeric experiments for testing the feasibility
    of the model, we consider N=3 that is total 6 number of SUs and two number of

    0.8 The graphs in Figure 3 and 4 obtained for above values indicate that mean
    number of SUs using the spectrum decreases as λ p and/or μ s increases. Similarly
    the deprivation rate is found for μ s =0.6 which increases as λ p and/or μ p increases.
    Now let λ s vary and λ p =0.2 and μ p =0.4 , the results in Figure 5 and 6 indicate
    that if (i) blocking rate increases as λ s increases or μ s decreases and (ii)
    utilization ratio increases as λ s increases and or μ s decrease. Now we observed
    in Figure 7 by letting N vary and setting λ p =0.2,  μ p =0.4 and λ s =5 that
    utilization ratio does not increase if we increase number of bands available to
    SUs. Fig 3: Mean no of SUs vs. Arrival Rate of PUs ( λ p ) Show All Fig 4: Deprivation

    The spectrum sharing is the important function of the spectrum management in Cognitive
    Radio Network. The CTMC based spectrum sharing scheme is presented here for two
    primary users and multiple secondary users and have derived some statistics of
    the scheme. The performance analysis of DSA can be done with the help of derived
    statistics. Further we will work on generalizing this scheme for multiple primary

    radios (CR) offer the promise of being a disruptive technology innovation that
    will enable the future wireless world. CR techniques are being applied in many
    different communications systems. They promise to improve the utilization of radio
    frequencies making room for new and additional commercial data, emergency, and
    military communications services. Today''s wireless networks are characterized
    by a fixed spectrum assignment policy. However, a large portion of the assigned
    spectrum is used sporadically and geographical variations in the utilization of
    assigned spectrum ranges from 25% to 75% with a high discrepancy in time. The
    limited available spectrum and the inadequacy in the spectrum usage necessitate
    a new communication standard to utilize the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically.
    This innovative networking standard is referred to as NeXt Generation (xG) Networks
    as well as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and cognitive radio networks(CRN). Cognitive
    Radio Networks are composed of wireless devices able to opportunistically access
    the shared radio resource. The core of such networking paradigm is the capability
    of cognitive radio to monitor the spectrum occupation to exploit spectrum holes
    for transmission. Spectrum sensing refers to the technique used by cognitive radios
    to scan the spectrum. in addition, the xG network roles such as spectrum management,
    spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing are explained in detail. The influence
    of these functions on the performance of the upper layer protocols such as routing
    and transport are investigated and open research issues in these areas are also
    summarized. In the end, challenges for the security, cross-layer design issues
    and future scope of of xG Network are concluded. Published in: 2010 International

    Introduction Frequency spectrum is a limited resource for wireless communications
    and may become congested owing to a need to accommodate the diverse types of air
    interface used in next generation wireless networks. To meet these growing demands,
    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) USA has expanded the use of the unlicensed
    spectral band [17]. However, since traditional wireless communications systems
    also utilize the frequency bands allocated by the TRAI in a static manner, they
    lack adaptability. Also, many studies show that while some frequency bands in
    the spectrum are heavily used, other bands are largely unoccupied most of time.
    These potential spectrum holes result in the under-utilization of available frequency
    bands. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Time efficiency is a basic characteristic for spectrum
    management and sharing in cognitive radio networks (CRN). In this paper, we introduce
    an incremental metric time into dynamic spectrum management and sharing problem,
    which could make the spectrum resource management more reasonable. On the one
    hand, to motivate the idle spectrum holders to share the spectrum more actively
    and regulate the spectrum leasing markets better , a spectrum management rule
    (SMR) is introduced. Accordingly, a spectrum lease rule (SLR) is proposed from
    the perspective of factual application requirements of unlicensed users (UUs).
    One the other hand, we formulate the spectrum sharing process as a two-dimensional
    packing problem, in which UUs utilize the spectrum resource through forming cooperative
    groups (CG). Finally, a distributed fast spectrum sharing algorithm (DFSS) is
    proposed to realize the process of CG forming promptly. Simulation demonstrates
    that DFSS algorithm can adapt to the cognitive radio networks effectively, and
    the average spectrum utilization ratio can reach about 83.42\%. Published in:

    Abstract In Chapter 13, the motivations and basic concepts of cognitive radio
    (CR) have been discussed. In the context of cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the
    spectrum management framework is a key element which aims at satisfying the CR
    users, quality-of-service requirements while protecting the primary users from
    unexpected interference. Spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing,
    and spectrum mobility are the major spectrum management functionalities in CNRs
    and these have been discussed in detail. Resource allocation and medium access
    control schemes are required for spectrum sharing. The basics of different resource
    allocation schemes with objectives such as power minimization, spectrum footprint
    minimization, sum rate maximization, and utility maximization have been illustrated.
    The main requirements for a cognitive medium access protocol have been discussed
    and the general framework for designing such a protocol has been illustrated.
    Finally, the concept of full-duplexing-enabled CRs has been introduced. References

    as reinforcement learning for learning problem in CRN. This paper provides an
    insight into the working principles of reinforcement learning based CRN and summarizes
    the recent survey papers done on the topic of learning based CRN. This paper also

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jeju, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction
    Spectrum sensing is considered to be the most important feature and application
    of the cognitive radio networks. Efficient spectrum sensing can enable efficient
    use of the bandwidth spectrum by exploiting the under-utilized spectrum in an
    opportunistic manner. It allows for the dynamic architecture for spectrum allocation,
    in which secondary users can sense for the un-utilized spectrum and use that if
    the licensed primary users are inactive. Even if the primary users occupy the
    frequency band, there still might be some locations where their transmitted power
    level is so low that it can be utilized by the secondary users without causing
    much of interference [1][2]. One of the best architectures used for dynamic spectrum
    allocation is cognitive radio networks. The main function of these networks is
    to exploit these spectrum holes also called as white spaces. This also allows
    for efficient resource utilization and addresses the challenge of under-utilization
    of radio resources. Cognitive radios have two type of architectures called as
    centralized and distributed architecture. In centralized architecture, the power
    information that is collected by per cognitive radio (CR), is shared at the central
    fusion point. The central fusion point than decides of presence or the absence
    of the primary users. But this results in a lot of communication complexity because
    of the amount of the messages exchanged between the radios and fusion center.
    Thus distributed solutions must be proposed to solve and address these issues.
    In the traditional approaches used for spectrum access such as underlaying spectrum
    sharing scheme [18] in which secondary users (SUs) coexist with the primary users
    (PUs) on the common shared frequency bands. However the secondary users adjust
    their levels of transmit power to maintain tolerable interference with the PU.
    This conventional scheme, however, makes use of a strong assumption that the channel
    state information (CSI) of secondary and primary users are known in prior to perform
    power control. Another traditional approach for dynamic spectrum access in cognitive
    radio networks is called as listen before talk. In this scheme the secondary user
    access a frequency band only in the case it is available. This scheme can avoid
    interference to primary users effectively, but reduces the opportunities for the
    users to access the frequency bands. Another way to solve this problem of dynamic
    spectrum access in cognitive radio networks is to use machine learning based approaches.
    Following are few key points that have been already discussed in the existing
    researches in context of machine learning based spectrum sensing [18]. Spectrum
    access will be determined not only by current spectrum sensing outcome but also
    by the learning result from past spectrum status Machine learning can enable dynamic
    spectrum access (DSA) devices to get accurate channel status and reliable predictions/statistic
    information of channel status In this paper we provide an insight into how machine
    learning algorithms can be used to deal with the challenges of the dynamic spectrum
    access in cognitive radio networks. All the recent surveys on the research done
    on the learning based cognitive radio are summarized in this work. We also present
    future research directions and propose 5G technologies that can be integrated
    in the learning based cognitive radio networks for effective spectrum management
    and utilization. One such 5G technology is called as network slicing that can
    support the real-time cognitive radio networks enabling low-latency, high throughput,
    a higher-layer network functionality, and customized QoS by virtualization of
    the physical network infrastructure. Through the support of network slicing in
    cognitive CRN, 5G systems are expected to become flexible and versatile network
    infrastructures where logical networks/partitions can be created with appropriate
    isolation and optimized characteristics to serve a particular purpose. SECTION
    II. Reinforcement Learning Based Cognitive Radio Networks When the dynamic of
    the system are highly unknown, and the system observations are not accurate, the
    reinforcement learning based methods can adapt to the system dynamics and know
    the unknown environment. As in the case of cognitive radio networks the dynamics
    of the system are highly unknown, and the system environment is highly uncertain
    as the primary user may join or depart the frequency spectrum at any time. Thus
    reinforcement learning methods hold significant promise here, by adapting and
    reacting to these dynamic changes. Reinforcement learning is an extremely useful
    type of machine learning algorithm in which an agent learns the methods to behave
    in an environment to maximize the cumulative reward [18]. The agent should be
    able to explore the environment to gather knowledge of the environment and exploit
    its gathered knowledge to select the best action it can take. Agent slowly develops
    a policy that maps from the observed state to the action. The working principle
    is shown in the Fig.1 Fig. 1. Working Principle of Reinforcement Learning Based
    CR Network Show All In the case of cognitive radio networks, we can consider each
    secondary users as an agent, and the decision of sensing as the action, the sensing
    outcome is the observed state, and the developed sensing strategy is the developed
    policy. The reinforcement learning based algorithm constantly updates the values
    in a Q-table representing the states. According to the states it determines the
    action that are to be taken. This Q-table constantly updates the value based not
    only on the current experience but also takes into account the past experience.
    A Q-learning based algorithm to improve the performance of dynamic spectrum access
    is proposed in many researches. Following the strategy of Q-learning, cognitive
    users does not always select the channels that have the largest values but instead
    they select the channels with a given probability of resulting in optimal long
    term rewards. A. Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Approach for CR The advantages
    of reinforcement learning (Q-learning) combined with neural networks form the
    deep Q-networks (DQN). The biggest advantage of using DQN is to make use of the
    neural networks to estimate the state values instead of updating the Q-table.
    Updating Q values in each iteration can often result in limitations of computer
    hardware and induce complexity specifically when the state space is large. This
    algorithm replaces the Q table with a multi-layer neural network. The simulation
    results showed great network performance improvement. The Table I. below summarizes
    the network environment and different machine learning techniques that have been
    used for spectrum sensing and spectrum access in cognitive radio networks recently.
    SECTION III. Cognitive Radios Application Domain and Future Research Direction
    A. Cognitive Radio in Public Safety With the explosion of various wireless technologies
    such as 5G, Internet of Things, home automation, and connected cars. The finite
    radio spectrum must accommodate cellular calls and data traffic from various wireless
    devices. As a result, the radio spectrum is quickly becoming a scarce commodity.
    As the spectrum becomes progressively scarce, the resources of the radio spectrum
    must be competed by public safety organizations with business organizations. Unless
    correctly resolved, the spectrum scarcity issue may lead in a less reliable future
    Public Safety Network (PSN) and may face interoperability difficulties. In addition,
    efficient detection and use of white spaces in the spectrum of public safety communication
    (PSC) is critical to minimizing outages and maximizing throughput. In some studies,
    as an enabler for PSNs with broadband communication capacities, pervasive spectrum
    sharing is envisaged [15]. Cognitive radio technology provides a feasible alternative
    for more efficient use of spectrum, which may solve the issue of spectrum scarcity.
    A cognitive radio senses and learns the spectrum of radio frequencies to function
    in unused parts of the licensed spectrum or white spaces without interfering with
    primary licensed users. Furthermore, a cognitive radio network provides assistance
    with current networks for heterogeneity, reconfigurability, self-organization,
    and interoperability. These cognitive radio capabilities can be instrumental with
    partially / completely destroyed networks during disaster situation. [16]. B.
    Integrating Machine Learning with Network Slicing for CR Networks 5G will pave
    the way for massive machine-type communications, which could support one million
    devices in a single square kilometer.The concept of network slicing is a new paradigm
    for future 5G networks where network infrastructure is split into slices that
    are dedicated to various services and customized to their requirements. With this
    paradigm, allocating the necessary resources to each slice is crucial, requiring
    the capacity to forecast their corresponding requirements. TABLE I Survey Papers
    Covering Different Aspects of Cognintive Radios Network slicing is a form of virtual
    network architecture in the same family as software-defined networking (SDN) and
    network virtualization (NFV) features that are strongly linked to network virtualization
    techniques. By partitioning network architectures into virtual elements, SDN and
    NFV allow much better network flexibility. In other words, network slicing enables
    various virtual networks to be created over a shared physical infrastructure.
    [17]. Fig. 2. Machine Learning Based CR Integrated with Network Slicing Show All
    A massive industrial IoT slice might need a light 5G core, with no handover but
    a large number of connections. On the other hand, a mobile broadband slice might
    need a high-capacity core, full feature mobility, and low latency. Slices are
    logically isolated, but resources can be shared among them. Fig. 2 represents
    cognitive radio network which integrated with network slicing allows creating
    multiple virtual networks over the same physical network, and Fig. 3 illustrates
    the network slicing concept for each environment. Fig. 3. Illustration of Network
    Slicing Concept Show All According to the Fig. 3, the network will be slice based
    on the frequency bandwidth requirements for each technology. The grand objective
    of 5G wireless technology is to support three generic services with vastly heterogeneous
    requirements: massive machine-type communications (mMTC), enhanced mobile broadband
    (eMBB), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Each of these service
    has different types of network capabilities. The slice of 5G mMTC consider various
    of sensors (e.g temperature, camera, wifi) which requires less frequency bandwidth.
    The slice for eMBB, type of multimedia traffic such as, smartphones, video, AR/VR,
    etc., which requires more bandwidth allocation. And slice for URLLC supports low-latency
    transmissions of small payloads with very high reliability from a limited set
    of terminals. URLLC services also referred as critical communication which usually
    used for public safety users. And in the bandwidth allocation requires to serve
    the priority users. C. Machine Learning in Network Slicing In the end, cognitive
    network management is introduced as the next generation of network management
    and a key driver of 5G. One such use case scenario of machine learning in network
    slicing is shown in the Fig.4. Fig. 4. Machine Learning Scenario in Network Slicing
    Show All D. Challenges and Future Research Direction in Learning Based Network
    Slicing 5G network providers need to construct network slices quickly and precisely
    in virtual network deployment and allocate network resources to satisfy service
    requests. Ground truth which refers to the accuracy of the training sets classification
    techniques in machine learning must be consider to check and select the most suitable
    ML techniques for network slicing. Static partition sharing or elastically dynamic
    sharing can implement resource sharing. The dynamic sharing of resources will
    be regarded in order to make the use of network resources more effectively. Data
    plane isolation and control plane isolation can be exposure for network slicing
    management across stakeholders. For group communication and priority services,
    the slice control function can be shared among slices. But the slice requires
    its own control feature for mission-critical communication. Fast mobility handover
    is essential for real-time services, which has a direct impact on service quality,
    particularly in network slicing handover and interference management. It needs
    coordination of intervention among license holders. Security has a significant
    consideration while designing network slicing routing and protocol. The effect
    on other slices or network slicing breakage in whole systems must be considered.
    Conclusion Cognitive radio network (CRN) is an intelligent wireless communication
    system that is aware of its surrounding environment and uses the methodology of
    understanding; by building to learn from the environment and adapt its internal
    states to statistical variations in the incoming radio frequency stimuli by making
    corresponding changes in certain operating parameters (e.g., transmit power; carrier
    frequency, and modulation strategy) in real-time. It has two primary objectives
    to achieve: (i.) providing highly reliable communication whenever and wherever
    needed and (ii.) efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. This paper provides
    an insight into the learning problem of the cognitive radio networks and summarizes
    the machine learning e.g. reinforcement learning, based approaches that have been
    adapted to deal with the problem of learning in CRN. We also propose a 5G network
    slicing based architecture that can be integrated with the machine learning based
    CRN to effectively manage and utilize the limited spectrum. Authors Figures References

    Nowadays research is being carried out on "Cognitive Radio Networks" as before
    the advent of the cognitive radio network utilization of frequency band was not
    so efficient and the major portion of spectrum remain unused mainly above 3 GHz
    . A cognitive radio network changes its transmitter parameters according to the
    operating environment and utilizes unused radio spectrum. In this paper we suggested
    an enhanced version of Carrier Sense Multiple Access to continuously sense the
    channel and assign bands to users. Using this technique a cognitive radio application
    has been designed to transmit real time data with minimal interference. The design
    satisfies the four phases of spectrum management which are classified as spectrum
    sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility. The simulation

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu, China SECTION I. Introduction We
    present here basic prologue to Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN), which is a new
    networking paradigm. Existing wireless networks have fixed spectrum assignment
    policy, so CRN are based on idea of exploiting the existing wireless network opportunistically.
    In today''s wireless networks the spectrum control is under the supervision of
    government agencies and is assigned to paid (primary) users or services, doing
    so the usage of assigned spectrum is from 15% to 85% of the total availability
    with a high variance in time. So we introduce here how to utilize spectrum that
    includes introduction to fields of spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum
    mobility and spectrum sharing—that are phases of spectrum management—[1]. Cognition
    is a word of psychology which means power of making decision. CRN has the ability
    of taking runtime decisions and transform its characteristics according to requirements
    of users and environment. Two main properties of the cognitive radio are: Cognitive
    capability: refers to the ability of radio technology to capture or sense the
    information from its environment. Through this capability, the portions of the
    spectrum that are unused at a specific time or location can be determined. Reconfigurability:
    enables the radio to be dynamically programmed according to the environment. We
    can say that cognitive radio can be programmed to transmit and receive on a number
    of frequencies CR users can be classified into two broad categories: Primary User
    (PU): are licensed users that pay for spectrum and have high priority. PUs are
    not aware of cognitive radio. Secondary User (SU): unlicensed users that use spectrum
    in the absence of primary users [2], [3]. In this paper we presented the algorithm
    which is based on enhanced CSMA technique and fulfills the four phases of spectrum
    management. Simulation results show how licensed and unlicensed users act co-operatively
    in cognitive environment. SECTION II. SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT Spectrum bands comprised
    of licensed (paid) and unlicensed (unpaid) bands. General characteristics associated
    with each spectrum include path loss, interference and wireless link errors. Secondary
    users must have to select the best possible path which fulfills their quality
    of service (QoS) requirements->spectrum management functions are needed [1]. Unused
    portions of the available spectrum are usually referred to as ‘white spaces or
    holes’. Secondary or cognitive users are allowed to fill these holes. A. Spectrum
    Sensing SUs have low priority for spectrum allocated to primary users. They are
    to avoid interference with PUs and maintain QoS. Therefore they have to continuously
    sense the channel or spectrum for detection of primary user [4]. So CR users make
    use of unused spectrum according to the environment. This requires them to find
    holes over spectrum for their transmission and monitoring band continuously to
    avoid interference [5]. The most efficient way of sensing is to detect PUs that
    is communicating in the frequency range of CR. However, it is difficult to keep
    track of primary transmitter and receiver over a channel. Thus, the major challenges
    to spectrum sensing include primary transmitter detection based on the spectral
    observations made by CRs [1]. B. Spectrum Decision CR (unpaid) users require the
    ability of selecting best spectrum for CR users out of existing band is known
    as spectrum decision. CR user activities affect each other. Spectrum decision
    has two main steps. Firstly, each spectrum band includes CR user information and
    statistical information of primary users in the network. Secondly, based on this
    information best available channel is selected [6]. Main functionalities required
    by spectrum decision include spectrum characterization (information about CR and
    PU), spectrum selection (based on QoS requirements) and reconfiguration (according
    to the radio environment). C. Spectrum Sharing Spectrum sharing provides the ability
    to keep effectiveness of PU and CR users without having interference between them.
    It allocates communication resources between users. It is carried out in the middle
    of communication system in a way that when there are multiple CR users then spectrum
    sharing is performed among them. Security feature is provided by maintaining QoS
    and not disturbing PU transmission with the interference of CR users. Four aspects
    of spectrum sharing are spectrum distribution behavior, architecture, spectrum
    access technology and scope. Considering architecture spectrum sharing is classified
    as distributed (based on local policies performed by each node distributively)
    and centralized (controlled by a central entity) [7], [8]. Allocation behavior
    is classified as cooperative (effect of one node is considered on other nodes)
    and non-cooperative (only a single node is encountered) [9]. Access technology
    is differentiated as overlay (node access the portion of spectrum not used by
    PUs) and underlay (CR node act as noise for PU/licensed user) [10]. Spectrum sharing
    techniques are based on two types of methods that are spectrum sharing among multiple
    CR networks (inter network) and spectrum sharing inside CR network (intra network).
    D. Spectrum Mobility If CR user is actively working on a certain band and that
    band is required by a PU, then CR user needs to continue its communication on
    some other vacant band, this is known as spectrum mobility. This introduces a
    kind of handoff in which CR user calls for transition to idle spectrum band. In
    CRN spectrum handoff happens in three situations: When PU is sensed When CR breaks
    its connections and necessitates mobility because of PU wants to communicate When
    QoS requirements are not satisfied[5] SECTION III. ALGORITHM We propose a model
    following enhanced CSMA technique for CRN while primary system is also operating
    with widely used carrier sensing protocols. It prevents the collision among users
    and ensures the integrity of data. As all users must have to sense the channel
    before transmitting and if it is feasible they start transmitting. CSMA is used
    because it efficiently allocates the specified band to users. At the same time
    multiple users can access the same channel for transmitting. Generally CSMA works
    in the following way: It allows multiple users to sense the channel. If some other
    user is already transmitting on the same channel then they have to wait a random
    amount of time. After that they again sense the channel and this phenomenon continues
    until they find a free channel for communication. We slightly modified this basic
    concept of CSMA by assigning priorities to the primary and secondary users. We
    considered two options in our implementation. First is to dynamically access and
    allocate the spectrum– also known as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)—. Second is
    the CRN specified four cases. We supposed sine wave as a primary user and pulse
    and square wave as secondary users. In some cases it is possible that both primary
    and secondary users can transmit simultaneously. In the proposed algorithm channel
    sharing is only done when there is more than one secondary user. Spectrum coordinator
    assigns particular bands to primary users. Assumption is that when primary user
    again starts transmitting after a certain amount of time it should transmit on
    that same specified band (as it is licensed for that particular band). It is maybe
    possible that after sometime signal is lost due to the addition of noise. Power
    Spectral Density (PSD) checks either the signal is present or lost after the addition
    of noise. Given below is the proposed algorithm: Give choice for DSA allocation
    and CRN specified cases Case A: DSA selected Input: PU and SU (total five) If
    spectrum slots empty Then raise opportunity for SU to fill slot If all slots filled
    Give option to empty slots Allow spectrum coordinator to enter noise in dB Case
    B: CRN specified cases selected Inputs: PU1, SU1, SU2 Spectrum: Band1, Band2 Output:
    Received user data in a given scenario Case 1: PU with no SU Band1 is assigned
    to PU1 and data received is of PU. Case 2: PU1 is transmitting on Band1 and SU1
    arrived SU1 checks all the available bands of spectrum and starts transmitting
    on first free available band. Case 3: No PU and more than one SUs All SUs calculate
    backoff time. SU with smaller backoff time starts transmitting first and then
    other SUs in the same order. Case 4: PU and SU interference When SU1 is transmitting
    on PU1 licensed band and the PU1 arrives, SU1 has to shift to other free band.
    PUs and SUs will repeat the above algorithm maintaining an effective and reliable
    data transmission. SECTION IV. SIMULATION RESULTS The objective of this section
    is to show efficient utilization of holes in a given range of spectrum and interaction
    between PU and SU. Results are divided into two sections depending on user''s
    choice. A. Dynamic Spectrum Access We have divided the total spectrum range into
    five slots. Spectrum coordinator assigns slots to PUs. If all slots are filled
    by PUs then SUs have to wait until the vacant slot is available. As soon as the
    first empty slot is available coordinator assigns it to SU as shown in Fig.1 and
    Fig.2. Similarly we can add noise to analyze the channel characteristics. Coordinator
    asks to enter the noise in decibels. Figure 1. Show All Figure 2. Show All After
    corrupting the signal it checks whether the signal is present or lost due to noise
    and display results accordingly as shown in Fig.3. All of these decisions are
    made considering PSD a concept which gives total power of the signal in given
    frequency range. Once all the parameter have been applied to the carrier, the
    system will ask for re-assignments of bands by starting the whole process again
    infinitely so that all the incoming users at any instant of time are accommodated
    in the spectral holes left in the channel maximizing the over all throughput of
    the channel. B. CRN Specified Cases It includes four major cases as: Only PU in
    scenario: Fig. 4 shows how PU utilizes its own band and there is no SU present.
    PU in one band and SU in other band: Fig. 5 shows this scenario. Figure 3. Noisy
    Channel''s PSD graph Show All Figure 4. Show All Figure 5. Show All SU''s Transmission:
    in this scenerio two SUs calculate backoff time in the form of random number,
    SU with lesser time is allowed to transmit its data first as shown in Fig.6. PU
    and SU interference: SU transmits data on free band and continues transmission
    until PU becomes active for its band, then SU has to vacate this particular band
    and will move to other free band as demonstrated in Fig. 7. Figure 6. Show All
    Figure 7. Show All SECTION V. CONCLUSION There are very few experimental simulations
    regarding CRN, thus we tried to come out with a very simple and efficient simulating
    technique using Matlab. Our approach was to take the decisions on the basis of
    power spectral density of the channel which can be used cognitively to find out
    the available holes those can be assigned to new incoming users thus improving
    the overall spectrum utilization. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to express cordial
    thanks to Dr. Adeel Akram and Wajahat Abbas for their valuable advice. Authors

    witnessing a major paradigm shift from fixed spectrum assignment policy to the
    dynamic spectrum access, which will completely change the way radio spectrum is
    managed. This step is required to greatly reduce the load on limited spectrum
    resources, which is being enforced by the exponential growth of wireless services.
    This is only feasible due to the capabilities of the cognitive radio, which will
    provide a new paradigm in wireless communication by exploiting the existing unused
    spectrum bands opportunistically. The chapter provides insight into recent developments
    in the area of cognitive radio networks with the main focus on review of the spectrum
    management, which consists of four main challenges: sensing of selected spectrum
    band, decision about sensed spectrum, sharing of spectrum among many users, and
    spectrum handoff. Further, sharing of target channel after a channel handoff is
    analyzed using game theory to get a different perspective on the existing medium
    access techniques. Request access from your librarian to read this chapter''s

    vital technological innovations in wireless communications, but it is also very
    important for the economic growth of a country (Bhattarai, Park, Gao, Bian, &
    Lehr, 2016).With the advent of various emerging wireless products, the usage of
    limited spectrum has grown exponentially in the recent years. Zhou et al.(2017)
    stated in their work that in the next few years, it is expected that global mobile
    data traffic will grow up to 49 EB/ month, which is nearly a seven times increase
    over year 2016. Kumar et al. (2018) reveals the trend in growth of mobile data
    traffic as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Trend in growth of mobile data traffic
    Therefore, it will become extremely difficult to satisfy the ever increasing demand
    through the current fixed spectrum assignment policy in which spectrum band is
    exclusively used for the particular applications and it has also led to under-utilization
    of a significant portion of the spectrum (like TV bands). It is almost impractical
    to find new frequency spectrum bands from the already in adequate spectrum resources
    to improve overall system capacity. To tackle the above challenges, a paradigm
    change is required in which spectrum is shared with more flexibility and dynamically
    among all categories of users. (Federal Communications Commission [FCC], 2003)
    has proposed to enable any unlicensed user to use the licensed frequency band
    such that no interference to the primary license holders is ensured. The solution
    to this problem is implemented by the use of cognitive radio by making dynamic
    spectrum access possible (Kumar, Dhurandher, & Woungang, 2018). Further, an eminent
    example of wireless standard that benefits from the recent developments in the
    area of cognitive radio is the IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Networks standard.
    In the rest of the chapter, an introduction to the cognitive radio networks, their
    application and then wireless regional area networks is provided in detail followed
    by game theoretic analysis of post handoff target channel sharing by the SUs.
    The last section draws the conclusion. Cognitive Radio The concept of cognitive
    radio was proposed by (Mitola, 2000). Cognitive radio techniques present the ability
    to utilize or share the spectrum band in an opportunistic manner. The under-utilization
    of spectrum is described in cognitive radio networks as a spectrum hole (Haykin,
    2005).As shown in Figure 2 (Akyildiz et al.,2009), a spectrum hole is a band of
    frequencies which is assigned to a licensed user, but, not being utilized by that
    user at a particular time and specific geographic location. Figure 2. Concept
    of spectrum holes Cognitive radio is the technology that enables the efficient
    use of spectrum holes. Akyildiz et al. (2006) formally define the cognitive radio
    as follows: A “Cognitive Radio” is a radio which is capable of interacting with
    the surrounding environment and based upon it’s learning, it can change it’s operating
    parameters (e.g. frequency, transmission power, modulation technique etc.) in
    real time to effectively utilize the spectrum band. According to this definition
    two main characteristics of the cognitive radio can be defined as (Haykin, 2005;Thomas

    Metrics Abstract: Today''s wireless networks are characterized by a fixed spectrum
    assignment policy. However, a large portion of the assigned spectrum is used sporadically
    and geographical variations in the utilization of assigned spectrum ranges from
    15% to 85% with a high variance in time. The limited available spectrum and the
    inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new communication paradigm to
    exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically. This new networking
    paradigm is referred to as cognitive radio networks. In this talk, the novel functionalities
    and current research challenges of the cognitive radio networks are explained
    in detail. More specifically, an overview of the cognitive radio technology is
    provided and the network architecture is introduced. Moreover, the cognitive network
    functions such as spectrum management, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing
    are explained in detail. The influence of these functions on the performance of
    the upper layer protocols such as routing and transport are investigated. Moreover,
    the network management, operation and maintenance problems are highlighted and
    open research issues in these areas are also outlined. Published in: 2008 IEEE

    IEEE Conference Location: Salvador, Brazil Today''s wireless networks are characterized
    by a fixed spectrum assignment policy. However, a large portion of the assigned
    spectrum is used sporadically and geographical variations in the utilization of
    assigned spectrum ranges from 15% to 85% with a high variance in time. The limited
    available spectrum and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage necessitate a new
    communication paradigm to exploit the existing wireless spectrum opportunistically.
    This new networking paradigm is referred to as cognitive radio networks as well
    as Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks. In this tutorial, the novel functionalities
    and current research challenges of the cognitive radio networks are explained
    in detail. More specifically, an overview of the cognitive radio technology is
    provided. Moreover, the cognitive network functions such as spectrum management,
    spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing are explained in detail. The overall objective
    of this tutorial is to provide a global and detailed view at the current state-of-the-art
    in Cognitive Radio Networks and present the still-open research issues and point
    out the research challenges for the realization of these networks. Authors Citations

    spectrum efficiency, Cognitive Radio technology is introduced with dynamic spectrum
    access. To achieve the dynamic spectrum access, the cognitive radio network is
    emerging with spectrum key functionalities such as spectrum sensing, spectrum
    management, spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility. Medium Access Control (MAC)
    protocol has an important role in most of the spectrum key functionalities like
    scheduling the available spectrum resources to choose the best channel based on
    QoS requirement, negotiation between the users for avoiding the collision and
    vacate the channel when the primary user is detected. In this review, the roles
    of MAC protocol in cognitive radio functionalities are analyzed. This review concentrated
    on the research publication in MAC protocol of past ten years. MAC protocols in
    cognitive radio network are classified and tabled based on the characteristics
    such as spectrum access, cooperation between the primary and secondary users,
    the structure of the network and common control channel. Finally, the advantages
    and the research challenges of the MAC protocol are identified and described.

    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction The radio
    spectrum is naturally limited, which is widely used as a crucial medium for bridging
    between transmitter and receiver in wireless communication. The radio spectrum
    is authorized and regulated by government or government-aided organization like
    TRAI (Telecommunication Regulatory and Authority of India) in India. These regulatory
    authorities are statically assigned the spectrum to different purpose wireless
    communication in military and civil use. The radio spectrum is a scarce resource
    and no more available band left for future wireless communication. The National
    Frequency Allocation Plan 2011 is released by the ministry of communication and
    IT under Government of India and is illustrated in Fig. 1 [3]. In this allocation,
    some of the bands are allocated to unlicensed users and it can be used freely
    by any users for developing and using some wireless technology. In this static
    allocation, the large portion of the licensed spectrum is used occasionally and
    inefficiently. At the same time, unlicensed band users are increased due to the
    role of new wireless applications. To solve the inefficient use of licensed portion
    and give more usage opportunity to the unlicensed users, dynamic spectrum usage
    technology proposed in Cognitive Radio (CR) by Mitola[6]. CR definition adapted
    by FCC is ” Cognitive radio: A radio or system that senses its operational electromagnetic
    environment and can dynamically and autonomously adjust its radio operating parameters
    to modify system operation, such as maximize throughput, mitigate inference, facilitate
    interoperability, access secondary markets” [2]. Cognitive Radio Network (CRN)
    users can be divided into two categories. First one is Primary User (PU) which
    user has licensed to use certain spectrum band. Another one is Secondary User
    (SU) which user operates in the ISM bands and also uses PUs spectrum without interfering
    that [5]. In the term of the task, CR has four main functionalities. Those are
    spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility
    [1]. Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is responsible for several functions
    in CRN like scheduling the sensing results, spectrum selection, spectrum sharing
    and spectrum mobility [4]. In traditional wireless networks, scheduling the access
    priority and resource allocation based on the QoS can radically improve the network
    performance. But not like a traditional network, the resource of the CRNs various
    with time, frequency and environment. These are focused on the Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) technology to develop new CR applications [8]. The functions of the
    MAC protocol in CRN are described below. Resource Scheduling Resource scheduling
    is the main task of MAC protocol in CRNs. In this resource scheduling, MAC protocol
    is collect the sensing information physical layer and scheduling the available
    channel with QoS providing information. Spectrum Selection The scheduled unused
    spectrum bands show different characteristics like time, operating frequency,
    and the bandwidth. Once all available channels are characterized, SU selects the
    best available channel for the current transmission considering QoS requirement.
    Fig. 1. National frequency allocation plan 2011 by ministry of communication and
    IT in india [3] Show All Spectrum Sharing After selecting the best vacant channel,
    SU can follow the channel access mechanism to avoid the harmful interference with
    PU and also contention with other SUs to avoid the collision between them. Mobility
    When PU wants to access the channel for own transmission, SU which one access
    that particular channel immediately vacates the channel and re-establish the connection
    with another available channel which one in the resource scheduling. This function
    mainly used to avoid collision with PU and improve the throughput of the network.
    This review work presents the challenges in developing MAC protocol for CRN in
    section II. In section III, the review of various MAC protocols proposed for CRNs
    is described. Several open research issues in developing MAC protocol to CRNs
    are described in section IV entitle to future work. This review concludes in section
    V and the reference taken for this review is listed in section VI. SECTION II.
    Challenges for MAC Protocol The four main functions of MAC protocol in CRN is
    described in section I. To achieve those functions, MAC protocol developers to
    consider some of the common challenges in Common Control Channel, Spectrum sensing
    accuracy, Co-operation process, channel access mechanism and connection management
    [7]. These challenges are analyzed and described in section. Common Control Channel
    (CCC) In the centralized network, one control station available to control the
    overall transmission within its coverage area. The control stations are basically
    known as Base Station (BS) and Access point (AP). The licensed or unlicensed channel
    is work as a CCC in the distributed network to control the transmission of the
    devices [17]. In traditional common control channel have one transceiver to manage
    the transmission with the low device and much energy consumption. In the CRN,
    the transceiver can do the channel sensing and data exchange at the same time.
    The single transceiver has addressed the problems like interference with PU, Collision
    between SUs and etc. Spectrum Sensing Accuracy The performance of the CRN is mostly
    based on spectrum sensing accuracy. In the transmission, source and destination
    nodes are performing spectrum sensing to detect the unused spectrum for opportunistic
    usage. Before starting the transmission, SU performs the out-of-band sensing to
    detect the unused PU channel to start the transmission. After starting the transmission,
    SU can do the in-band and out-of-band sensing consciously. In-band sensing is
    used to find the PU arrival. When SU find the PU arrival at the particular channel,
    immediately SU vacate the channel and PU take over the channel for its own transmission.
    After vacating the licensed channel, SU performs the out-of-band sensing to find
    the new opportunistic spectrum channel and re-establish the connection to continue
    the transmission [19]. The performance of the MAC protocol is based on the sensing
    accuracy. The sensing accuracy affecting factors are channel fading, shadowing,
    noise, path loss and etc [9]. Cooperation Process The cooperation process is critically
    important in the CRNs. Two different cooperation processes are needed for CRNs
    like cooperation in sensing, cooperation in sharing. In the cooperative spectrum
    sensing, PUs and SUs have exchanged the information about idle and activity stages.
    This sensing is used to get accurate sensing results and also reduce the interference
    where the single SU cannot hear a PU because of the issue such as shading from
    PU. Cooperative spectrum sharing is used to avoid multiple users'' collision in
    a best available channel. In this process, the common technique is used for forming
    clusters to share user''s activity information locally. This localized operation
    provides an effective balance between centralized and distributed networks [9],
    [12]. Connection Management This function is introduced to provide high throughput
    and seamless communication in the wireless network. In the CRNs, this connection
    management is managed by spectrum mobility function [5]. In a traditional wireless
    network, mobility is described when the device moves from one place to another
    place. When this mobility is increased and the device move from one coverage area
    to another coverage area, handoff concept is introduced to continue the transaction.
    In the handoff process, transaction information sends to the new BS or AP to continue
    the transaction. In CRNs, spectrum mobility is rising the new type of handoff.
    When the specific portion of the unused spectrum used by SU is required by PU,
    SU must be switched the communication to another unused spectrum [14]. The handoff
    is closely joined together with spectrum sensing and spectrum decision management.
    SECTION III. Review of MAC Protocols in CRN In this section, the protocols proposed
    for CRNs are reviewed and explain how these protocols are approached the above
    challenges. This review considers the different factors like type of spectrum
    access, cooperation for spectrum sensing, sensing environment, number of radios
    used, availability of CCC, architecture, quiet period, mobility aware and multi-channel
    hidden terminal problem. DSAT MAC It proposed with the aim of energy efficient
    solution for increasing the spectrum utilization and also maintains QoS and guarantees
    a fair share of spectrum among CR nodes. This protocol proposed for the distributed
    network. It proposed with a single radio. So this protocol not aware of the collision,
    interference and hidden node terminal problem. Packet sequence transmission is
    proposed in this protocol. Further, this packet sequence transmission is split
    its function with two different sequences. Those are controlled packet sequence
    with CSMA/CD based channel access mechanism and data packet sequence with the
    packet, which one is ready to send. Spectrum sensing can be performed at regular
    intervals. Packet scheduling algorithm with net priority index is used to send
    the data in priority queue [18]. FMAC This Fair MAC protocol proposed with the
    limitation of one primary user and ‘M’ number of co-existing CRNs. Every CRN has
    ‘N’ number of SU. Spectrum sensing and data transmission can do with separate
    radios. Sensing and transmission information are sharing through CCC. SUs in the
    same CRN are doing cooperative sensing to know the PUs activity and efficiently
    use the spectrum. SUs need to take some time duration to find out the channel
    state. Channel state updated periodically after every sensing time period. PU
    frame transmission time is smaller than the sensing time period. SU transmission
    may be interrupted by reappearing of PU, SU vacates the channel immediately. After
    completion of PU transmission, all SUs have same opportunity to access the channel
    [10]. Hybrid MAC It is modified and similar concept of CSMA/CA protocol. In this
    MAC protocol used overlay spectrum sharing to access the PU. So this protocol
    allows PU and SU are transmitting the data at the same time. Because primary receiver
    determines the Signal Interference Radio (SIR). This protocol increases the transmitting
    power of the nodes to solve hidden node problem, tolerate the minimum interference,
    knowing location and channel gain. SIR depends on the SU''s transmitting power
    and SU''s distance from the PU receiver. Two different sensing points are described.
    SU sensing point is used to sense the neighbor SUs. AP sensing point is used to
    determine the PU channel activity. AP broadcast the sensing information to synchronized
    channels. [11]. GC MAC This MAC mainly focused on spectrum sensing exactness and
    spectrum efficiency. In this protocol, SUs are grouped into several teams. SUs
    in the same team are sensing the targeted channel jointly. Each team selects different
    channels to sense. Each team continues the sensing in the different channel up
    to discover the available channel. SU is equipped with single radio and also has
    common control channel for cooperation. In this protocol, time frames are divided
    into three different stages. In the reservation stage, when a packet is buffered
    in the queue, the source node sends the reservation requirement to the destination
    node. Sensing and transmission are next two stages respectively to do sense the
    activity of the destination node and send the data to the destination. SU selecting
    algorithm is used to reduce the sensing overhead. This protocol is analyzed for
    both saturation and non-saturation networks [19]. Table 1. Characteristics of
    various MAC protocols HC MAC In this Hardware Constrained cognitive MAC, SUs are
    equipped with one radio. The radio can perform sensing or transmit at a particular
    time. A common channel is available for SUs at any time to exchange the information.
    One of the unlicensed band can act as a common channel. This common channel is
    performed like a control channel for contention and collaboration. This protocol
    does not involve any synchronization operation. The PU is tolerating a certain
    degree of interference from SU. The time frame in this protocol consists of three
    separated parts for series of SU operations. The three parts are contention, sensing,
    and transmission. All these packets are sent on the CCC. Contention RTS/CTS packets
    are used to reserve the channel with the handshake between sender and receiver.
    The CCC busy information is sent to the neighbors. Sensing RTS/CTS packets are
    used to exchange unused channel sensing information between sender and receiver.
    Transmission RTS/CTS packets are used to exchange the end of the transmission
    process and CCC state information to neighbors. The multi-channel hidden terminal
    problem is arising due to the single radio SU devices and absence of a global
    synchronization [13]. IEEE 802.22 The IEEE 802.22 team is working to develop a
    CR based Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN). The team concentrates to utilize
    idle TV spectrum band with modification in traditional physical and MAC layer.
    It has a centralized architecture that uses Base Station (BS) for spectrum access
    and sharing. This system specifies a fixed point to multipoint which BS manages
    its own coverage area and associated with Consumer Premise Equipments (CPE). The
    in-band and out-of-band sensing are performed by BSs and CPEs. BSs indicate all
    the sensing related information to each of their CPEs. The quiet period mechanism
    is comprised of two stages. Those are fast sensing and fine sensing. The fast
    sensing comprised number of sensing periods and fast sensing algorithm like simple
    energy detection is employed. The fine sensing is started when BS gets the fast
    sensing results. This fine sensing is performed to select the target channel.
    Spectrum mobility is also organized well by this working group [16]. SYN-MAC This
    synchronized MAC protocol proposed for multi-hop cognitive radio networks. In
    the multi-hop network, a number of nodes available between the source to destination
    are changed from time to time due to primary user occupancy and environment heterogeneous.
    The challenges in CCC and multi-channel hidden terminal problems which are common
    for both multi-channel and multi-hop networks are solved by this protocol. In
    this protocol, the total time is divided into fixed time intervals. Each time
    slot is dedicated to one of the available channels for control signal exchanges.
    All the nodes in the network sensing the available channels at the beginning of
    each time slot. It is called network initialization state. SUs equipped with two
    radios. First, one is used to sense the channel and control signals. When the
    node start, stop or change its state for communication, information is forward
    to the neighbors and available channel list is updated in every node. When the
    node wants to communicate with neighbors, it sends the RTS with control information.
    After getting acceptance (CTS), the node starts the communication without delay.
    A multichannel hidden terminal problem could not be avoided for synchronization
    and extra sensing radio [17]. CREAM MAC This protocol proposed with cooperative
    spectrum sensing to improve the spectrum sensing exactness and also reduce the
    interference level of SUs in PUs. SU equipped with the single transceiver and
    employs four-way handshakes of control packets can help to solve the hidden terminal
    problem. These four type control packets are Ready to Send (RTS), Clear to Send
    (CTS), Control State Transmitter (CST) and Control State Receiver (CSR). RTS/CTS
    control packet handshake is used to solve the hidden terminal problem and guaranteeing
    to avoid collision between SUs. CST/CSR control packet handshake is proposed to
    synchronize the PU channel information with sender and receiver of SU for avoiding
    collision between SU and PU [12]. DOSS MAC In this dynamic open spectrum sharing
    MAC protocol, the spectrum is split into three categories for three different
    uses. Those three categories are data split to manage the communication, control
    split to signaling and busy tone for denotes contention. The data channel algorithm
    is proposed based on RTS/CTS mechanism and busy tone approach. It is used to solve
    hidden terminal problems and exposed terminal problems. The data channel algorithm
    consists of three components. These are spectrum mapping, spectrum negotiation,
    and data transmission. The two-way handshake is used to spectrum negotiation.
    SU equipped with multiple radios to avoid the hidden terminal problem in particular
    CRN. Two different bands are managed the busy tone and common information exchange
    separately [15]. C-MAC In this cognitive MAC, each SU has single radio and each
    channel has its own superframe structure. Both the inband and out-of-band sensing
    are performed with the particular time interval. In-band sensing requires tight
    control to detect the PU''s appear to avoid interference, while out-of-band sensing
    is less critical to find available channels for transmission. Superframe of each
    channel composed of two different parts: Beacon Period (BP), Data Transfer Period
    (DTP). To coordinate nodes in the different channel, dynamic rendezvous channel
    (RC) is introduced with multi-channel resource reservation. RC is responded to
    assign the best available channel. The RC is used as a vehicle to send group communication
    packets across the channel [14]. PRO MAC Proactive Medium Access Control protocol
    (ProMAC) is designed and proposed for sensing the channels and assign the channel
    to improve the channel utilization. To achieve the more channel utilization, this
    protocol assigning the channel based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework.
    With this MPC framework, the protocol minimizing the energy consumption, reducing
    the number of control messages and limits the channels sensed by an SU. This protocol
    has not discussed the method of free channels list management, the number of radios
    needs for all the process and reactive spectrum handoff [20]. LU-MAC LU-MAC protocol
    is proposed for cognitive radio technology based Wi-Fi network to find maximum
    idle probability spectrum within the jamming resistance. This protocol has been
    projected with three algorithms such as Statistic-based Reactive Channel Switching
    algorithms, Random Frequency Hopping Pattern generation algorithm, and Intrusion
    Detection System to respond the jammer attack. In this protocol, data channels
    are monitoring periodically to find the presence of PU and jammer[21]. SECTION
    IV. Future Research Challenges Common Control Channels are used to control the
    channels for cooperative spectrum access. It is the meeting point of SUs in CRN.
    The performance of the network is decreased due to SUs crowd in CCC. The node
    which is not synchronized with CCC cannot able to know the activity of neighboring
    cognitive users. So the future developments are concentrating on developing CCC
    with reliable, easy synchronization, more heterogeneous information and efficiently
    manage the saturation. Available resource scheduling is more important work of
    MAC in CRNs to improve the spectrum efficiency. It is used to select a best available
    channel based on QoS requirements. Local spectrum sensing result is affected by
    various factors like fading, shadowing, noise and etc. The sensing result and
    MAC performance are closely coupled to improve the spectrum efficiency. The cooperative
    spectrum sensing and MAC protocol are designed together to improve the spectrum
    efficiency based on cross-layer approach. Channel access mechanism is regulating
    the users to use the available resource between sender and receiver. The channel
    access mechanism is the core of the MAC protocol. It is used to avoid the collision
    among the users. Additionally, it is used to restrict the hidden terminal problem
    and exposed terminal problem. So the future developers want to concentrate this
    channel access mechanism to avoid collisions among SUs and prevent the collision
    between PU and SU. To improve the throughput and provide the seamless communication
    between the users, the future works are concentrated on spectrum mobility. When
    the PU want to use the particular channel which one is occupied by SU, SU immediately
    vacates the channel with handoff mechanism and continue the transmission with
    some other available channel based on connection management concept. SECTION V.

    which are developed for CRNs. The challenges for MAC protocol in CRN are analyzed
    and presented and also different factors in various MAC protocols are investigated
    and scheduled. Finally, this review describes the various open research challenges
    in MAC protocol to the researchers for future work. Authors Figures References

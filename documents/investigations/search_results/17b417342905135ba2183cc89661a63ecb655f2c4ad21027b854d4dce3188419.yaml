    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification

    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are
    half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor
    with respect to the soil. Download : Download high-res image (373KB) Download

    equation (10). (10) where is the IRT inclination, is FOV/2 and is the half of
    the ellipse-major axis from Fig. 3b. (11) (12) (13) (14) Using the ellipse equation

    (16) is obtained. (15) (16) where is the half of the minor axis of the ellipse.
    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    and GPS location on the center pivot. A Geo7X GPS (Trimble®, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
    allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates,
    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and
    discussion Fig. 5a shows the GPS node located at the center pivot final tower.

    cell panel connected to a voltage regulator from 12 V to 5 V. The Raspberry Pi3

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

    The delineation of management zones is a prerequisite for the application of variable
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology. Static prescription maps based on soil texture,
    apparent soil electrical conductivity and soil available water holding capacity
    have been widely used in VRI management for wheat, maize, cotton and other crops
    (Evans et al., 2013, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2016; Sui et al.,
    2017; Barker et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2021). As static prescription maps cannot
    reflect the crop water stress caused by spatially variable precipitation, topography,
    variable soil infiltration rates (Sadler et al., 2005), and disease and pest infestations
    (Falkenberg et al., 2007), it is believed that dynamic VRI management based on
    remote sensing could provide a better method for obtaining the real-time crop
    water stress distributions (Stone et al., 2020) and consequently adjusting management
    zones and irrigation amounts. Canopy temperature (Tc) is an important index for
    estimating crop water deficit because of its nondestructive nature and comparatively
    low cost (Lena et al., 2020). As the spatial variation in Tc in the field can
    directly reflect the relative irrigation requirements, Tc is recommended for VRI
    management (Siegfried et al., 2017). The development of infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) mounted on a moving sprinkler irrigation system supplied a good method
    for obtaining Tc throughout the whole field and, consequently, VRI management
    (Sadler et al., 2002; Peters et al., 2008) and verified the generation of dynamic
    prescription maps (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015; Bhatti et al., 2023). As Tc is
    easily affected by air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure and other
    factors, crop water stress indices based on Tc have been gradually developed,
    such as the difference between Tc and atmospheric temperature (Jackson, et al.,
    1977), the empirical crop water stress index (CWSI) based on air vapor pressure
    deficit (Idso et al., 1981), theoretical CWSI based on the energy balance of crop
    canopies and the PenmanMonteith equation (Jackson et al., 1981), the temperaturetime
    threshold (Upchurch et al., 1996), the degrees above non-stressed (DANS) (Taghvaeian
    et al., 2014) and the normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) (Elsayed et
    al., 2015). The CWSI has been successfully used to monitor water stress in a variety
    of crops (Payero and Irmak, 2006; O''Shaugnessey et al., 2012), but its adoption
    as an irrigation scheduling method has been limited because its computation requires
    the establishment or modeling of non-stressed and maximally stressed crop conditions,
    along with concurrent measurements of air temperature and relative humidity (DeJonge
    et al., 2015). DANS is a simplified crop thermal index that relates observed Tc
    to a single non-stressed canopy baseline temperature and has been used for monitoring
    water stress in maize (DeJonge et al., 2015) and sunflower (Taghvaeian et al.,
    2014), but it is difficult to directly determine the irrigation amount in VRI
    management. The NRCT has a similar theoretical basis to that of the CWSI, in which
    the lowest and the highest temperatures measured in the whole field were considered
    the lower baseline and upper baseline, respectively. Compared to DANS, NRCT is
    a normalized index between 0 and 1, which can be used as a reduction coefficient
    to calculate the irrigation amount in each management zone, and consequently to
    generate the VRI prescription map. A positive correlation between the NRCT and
    drought stress has been demonstrated by Elsayed et al., 2015, Elsayed et al.,
    2017 through field experiments. With the application of unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) thermal imaging in agricultural management (Kashyap et al., 2023.), the
    NRCT was also used in a neural net-work model to predict the canopy water content
    of rice (Elsherbiny et al., 2021) and in the prediction of the maize crop coefficient
    (Shao et al., 2023). As the Tc measured by IRTs mounted on a moving sprinkler
    irrigation system are discrete values, it is necessary to select a reasonable
    interpolation method and sampling density to reduce the number of sensors and
    to obtain distribution maps of the Tc suitable for dynamic VRI management. Kriging
    interpolation is often used when variables are spatially correlated (Knotters
    et al., 1995). By analyzing the spatial correlation of Tc for soybean (Fletcher
    et al., 2019), cotton (Yates et al., 1983), wheat and maize (Zhang et al., 2022),
    the ordinary kriging (OK) method has been recommended for Tc interpolation. The
    sampling density of Tc was determined by the number of IRTs mounted on the sprinkler
    irrigation system and the sampling time interval. It is believed that a larger
    sampling density will produce smaller errors (Chen et al., 2008). To balance the
    cost of IRT sensors and the accuracy of Tc distribution maps, the upper limit
    of the sampling time interval needs to be studied. The main objective of the present
    research was to study the appropriate sampling time interval of Tc obtained with
    IRTs mounted on a moving sprinkler irrigation system for dynamic VRI management.
    Simultaneously, a method of generating VRI prescription maps based on NRCT was
    proposed, and the accuracy of VRI prescription maps based on IRTs data and the
    recommended sampling time interval were compared with those obtained by a UAV
    thermal imaging system. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design The
    field study was carried out at two sites in the North China Plain. One site was
    located at Shunyi (40.22°N and 116.60°E) in Beijing (referred to as site 1), and
    the other site was located at Dacaozhuang (37.28°N and 114.54°E) in Hebei Province
    (referred to as site 2). The experimental crops were summer maize and winter wheat
    at site 1 and site 2, respectively. The cutting ring method was used to measure
    the field water holding capacity, which was 0.31 cm3/cm3 at site 1 and 0.41 cm3/cm3
    at site 2 for the 0–60 cm soil depth. The plant spacing of summer maize was 24 cm,
    and the row spacing was 58 cm.The seeding rate of winter wheat was 375 kg/ha.
    The maximum crop heights of summer maize and winter wheat were 280 cm and 73 cm,
    respectively. At site 1, the 4.5 ha experimental plot was controlled by a two-span
    center pivot irrigation system with an overhang (118 m in total). An array of
    seven IRTs (CSTCLT15CB3, Optris, Germany) was mounted on the center pivot irrigation
    machine at equal intervals with the outermost IRT installed at a distance of 115.5 m
    from the center pivot. Tc was recorded every 30 s. At site 2, the experimental
    plot was a 3.5 ha semicircular controlled by a three-span center pivot irrigation
    system with an overhang (150 m in total). An array of 11 IRTs was mounted on the
    center pivot irrigation machine beginning from the second span, with an equal
    area controlled by each IRT to achieve a similar representativeness to that of
    the whole field for each IRT. An additional IRT was mounted on the first span
    to help construct the Tc distribution maps. The Tc was recorded every 1 min. All
    IRTs pointed to the crop canopy at an angle of 135° relative to the vertical mast
    and were 2.5 m above the ground. The IRTs were calibrated against a black body
    prior to the beginning of the experiment. The speed of the center pivot irrigation
    system was 2.9 m/min at both sites, and the system took 4 h and 20 min to walk
    around at site 1 and 2 h and 40 min at site 2, respectively. The nozzle spacing
    was 2.9 m at site 1 and 2.5 m at site 2. At both sites, the modified Heermann
    and Hein uniformity coefficient (CUHH) of the center pivot irrigation systems
    observed was 75%, which was consistent with the investigation results of Yan et
    al. (2020) for large sprinkler irrigation machines in China. To convert the Tc
    measured by the IRTs mounted on the moving sprinkler irrigation system to the
    same time, stationary IRTs (Fig. 1) were also installed at the location representing
    the average soil moisture content at the experimental sites (Li et al., 2018).
    Representative locations were selected according to the soil clay content after
    analyzing the temporal stability of soil water content (Zhao et al., 2018), and
    this method was also feasible for dynamic VRI management (Zhu, 2023). There were
    nine IRTs at site 1 and three at site 2. These IRTs also pointed to the crop canopy
    at an angle of 135° relative to the vertical mast and were 1 m above the crop
    canopy. Download : Download high-res image (102KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Stationary IRT in the field. Traditional uniform rate irrigation
    management was used at these two sites. At site 1, the 0–60 cm average soil water
    capacity (AWC) was 128.3 mm. Thirty-five TDR Trime-tubes (Trime-T3, IMKO Ltd.,
    Ettlingen, Germany) were used to measure the soil water content to a depth of
    100 cm at 20 cm increments every seven days and the average soil water content
    at 60 cm depth was used to calculate the irrigation amount required to replenish
    the soil water content to 90% of the field capacity. At site 2, the 0–60 cm average
    AWC was 196.4 mm, and three ECH2O sensors (Decagon Devices, Washington, USA) were
    arranged at places representing the average soil moisture content of the field.
    Irrigation was initiated when the average soil water content at depths of 10 cm,
    30 cm and 50 cm reached an irrigation trigger point of 67% field capacity. The
    irrigation amount was the difference between the cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and effective rainfall. The ETc was calculated by reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ET0) and crop coefficient (Kc) using the Penman–Monteith equation (Allen et al.,
    1998). The precipitation events and the cumulative irrigation amount applied to
    summer maize at site 1 and winter wheat at site 2 are shown in Fig. 2. The single-time-of-day
    temperature was obtained by running the center pivot at 100% speed on cloudless
    days when the IRTs were operating but not the irrigation. The observation dates
    all occurred between the two irrigation events and on sunny days at different
    crop growth stages. The Tc of summer maize was obtained at the jointing stage
    on August 5, the heading stage on August 22 and the filling stage on August 27,
    2019. Moderate rainfall occurred one day before the measurement on August 22.
    The highest air temperatures on these days were 29.9℃,30.8℃ and 34.3℃, respectively.
    The Tc of winter wheat was obtained at the booting stage on April 20, the flowering
    stage on May 5 and the filling stage on May 17, 2021, and light rainfall occurred
    one day before May 17. The highest air temperatures on these days were 20.8℃,27.0℃
    and 26.1℃, respectively. The soil water content at depths of 0–60 cm on the observation
    dates was greater than 90% of the field capacity for summer maize and greater
    than 67% of the field capacity for winter wheat. Download : Download high-res

    at site 2. 2.2. Acquisition of Tc and NRCT To ensure the uniform distribution
    of sampling points in the field, the sampling time interval should be the submultiple
    of the time that the center pivot sprinkler system takes to walk around (Zhao
    et al., 2020). At site 1, the sampling time intervals were 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10,
    13, and 26 min, and the corresponding numbers of pie-shaped segments were 3640,
    1820, 910, 455, 364, 182, 140 and 70, with the largest segment of 21 m2 at sampling
    time intervals of 0.5 min and 1092 m2 at 26 minutes. At site 2, the sampling time
    intervals were 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, and 20 min, and the corresponding numbers
    of pie-shaped segments were 1920, 960, 480, 384, 240, 192, 120 and 96, with the
    same segments of 20 m2 at sampling time intervals of 1 min and 400 m2 at 20 min,
    except for the first span of the sprinkler irrigation system. When the sampling
    time intervals was 26 min and 20 min at these two sites, the number of sampling
    points was less than 100. Taking the sampling time of 5 minutes as an example,
    the distribution of the locations with Tc data is shown in Fig. 3. The distance
    of the outermost sensor for the 5 min sampling time interval covered 14.5 m. Obviously,
    the outer sensors travel further and faster than the inner sensors, namely, the
    recommended sampling time interval is for the outermost sensor mounted on the
    center pivot system. Download : Download high-res image (162KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The distribution of the locations with Tc data at a sampling
    time interval of 5 min. At different sampling time intervals, the Tc was calculated
    as the average value of the Tc measured every 30 s and 1 min during this period
    at site 1 and site 2, respectively. Then, the average Tc for a given sampling
    time interval was converted to the same time when the highest Tc occurred using
    the scaled method (Peters et al., 2004) based on the Tc measured at the stationary
    reference location. The scaling equation was as follows: (1) where Trmt is the
    predicted temperature in the field at any time; Te is the predawn minimum Tc;
    Tref is the reference Tc at the same time as Trmt; Trmt,t is the one-time-of-day
    Tc measurement at any daylight time t measured by the IRTs on the pivot lateral;
    and Tref,t is the measured reference temperature for time t. The selection of
    Te, Tref and Tc at reference locations are all based on referred to the results
    of Zhang et al. (2021). For winter wheat, Te had the lowest Tc from 4:00–6:00,
    and Tref had the highest Tc from 11:00–15:00. For summer maize, Te had the lowest
    Tc from 3:00–7:00, and Tref had the highest Tc from 11:00–17:00. The Tc at the
    reference location was the average value of Tc measured by all IRTs in the field.
    The NRCT was calculated by the converted Tc: (2) where T is the infrared temperature
    measured in the canopy and Tmin and Tmax are the lowest and highest temperatures
    measured in the whole field, respectively (Elsayed et al., 2015). When T =Tmin,
    NRCT= 0, there is no water deficit. When T = Tmax, NRCT = 1, indicating that there
    is a maximum water deficit. A greater irrigation amount was needed with a greater
    NRCT value. Because the number of Tc values obtained by IRTs mounted on a moving
    sprinkler irrigation system was far below that obtained with a UAV thermal imaging
    system, an additional experiment was carried out at site 2 in 2022 to verify the
    accuracy of dynamic VRI prescription maps based on IRTs. The UAV thermal imaging
    system and the IRTs system were operated in a random 90° area at site 2 on May
    22, May 23 and May 26, 2022. The UAV thermal imaging system was composed of a
    hexacopter frame (DJI Matrice 200 V2, Shenzhen, China), a thermal imaging camera
    (Zenmuse XTS, Shenzhen, China) and a control platform. Before using the UAV thermal
    imaging system to obtain Tc, a conversion model between the sum of the red, green,
    and blue band values and Tc was constructed, and the flight time was recommended
    from 11:00–15:00 for winter wheat and from 11:00–16:00 for summer maize in the
    North China Plain (Zhu et al., 2023). The distribution maps of the NRCT and the
    average irrigation amount based on the VRI prescription maps were generated and
    compared between the UAV system and IRTs system. 2.3. Method of generating NRCT
    distribution maps For the IRTs system, the NRCT values were interpolated in ArcGIS
    software. Before the management zones were delineated, the distribution maps of
    NRCT were divided into three grades in the equal range: 0–0.33, 0.33–0.67 and
    0.67–1. For the UAV system, the thermal infrared band (TIR) images were preprocessed
    by Pix4Dmapper software (Pix4D SA, Lausanne, Switzerland). The important steps
    of this procedure included geolocating the images, importing ground control points,
    aligning the images and building dense point clouds, digital surface models and
    orthomosaics. Then, the TIR maps were converted to Tc distribution maps by the
    conversion model (Zhu et al., 2023). The spatial distribution maps of Tc were
    imported into ArcGIS software and the canopy temperature was calculated as the
    NRCT by a grid calculator, which is a mathematical operation tool for grid data
    in ArcGIS software. 2.4. Method of generating prescription maps of VRIs For these
    two center pivot irrigation systems, the management zones were divided into concentric
    rings with four nozzles in one group along the truss direction of the sprinkler
    and sectors with an interval of 15° along the rotating direction. After the NRCT
    distribution maps were superimposed on the management zones, the average NRCT
    in each management zone was calculated. Then, K-means clustering was carried out
    to divide the average NRCT and consequently, the management zones into 3 grades.
    According to the VRI decision support system (Zhao et al., 2021), the basic irrigation
    amount I was calculated by using meteorological data, and then the irrigation
    amount in each management zone was obtained by multiplying I by the average value
    of NRCT in each grade. The VRI prescription map shows the amount of irrigation
    applied in each management zone by changing the moving speed of the center pivot
    irrigation system and the duty cycle of solenoid valve. The irrigation amount
    in the whole field was the weighted average of the irrigation amount in each management
    zone. In the practical application of dynamic VRI management based on Tc, because
    it increases energy consumption in determining the irrigation time by running
    a sprinkler irrigation system every day, this research proposed a method to determine
    the irrigation time by real-time measuring the soil water content. When the soil
    water content reached the irrigation trigger threshold, the sprinkler irrigation
    system was used to collect the Tc data and delineate the management zones and
    prescription map based on the NRCT distribution map. The maximum irrigation amount
    could be calculated as the crop water requirement during two irrigation events,
    and the irrigation amount at other water stress levels should be reduced by multiplying
    a coefficient determined by the NRCT. 2.5. Statistical analysis To analyze the
    influence of sampling time intervals on Tc spatial autocorrelation, the nugget
    (C0), sill (C0 +C), range (A0), best fitting model and determination coefficients
    (R2) of the semivariogram function for Tc were calculated by GS+ software at different
    sampling time intervals. The range of the spatial correlation measures the distance
    beyond which two observations are spatially uncorrelated. The nugget represents
    the measurement error and unobserved microscale variability. The sill represents
    the constant variance of the observations. The ratio of nugget to sill (RNS) could
    be used to express the extent of spatial autocorrelations (Zheng et al., 2008).
    RNS values less than 25%, 25%-75% and greater than 75% represent strong, moderate
    and weak spatial autocorrelation, respectively (Xu et al., 2006). The cross-validation
    method was used to evaluate the effects of the sampling time interval on the accuracy
    of the Tc and NRCT distribution maps generated by ArcGIS. The OK interpolation
    method was used in ArcGIS because of the spatial correlation of Tc. During the
    cross-validation process, the sample value at a particular location was temporarily
    discarded from the sample dataset and then estimated using the remaining samples.
    After this procedure was repeated for all available samples, the measured values
    and estimated values were compared using statistics (Sun et al., 2009). The normalized
    root mean square error (nRMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were calculated:
    (3) ̅ (4) ̅ ̅ where Si is the estimated value, Oi is the measured value, ̅ is
    the mean value of the measured values, is the mean value of the predicted values,
    n is the number of Tc or NRCT scatter values obtained at the experimental sites,
    σs is the standard deviation of the predicted values and σo is the standard deviation
    of the measured values. The simulation was considered excellent if the nRMSE was
    less than 10%, good if the nRMSE was greater than 10% and less than 20%, fair
    if the nRMSE was greater than 20% and less than 30% and poor if the nRMSE was
    greater than 30% (Dettori et al., 2011). The tabulate area tool in ArcGIS was
    used to compare the overlap percentage (percentage of overlap area of the same
    grades in the total area of the field) in the NRCT distribution maps among the
    different sampling time intervals. Based on the recommended sampling time intervals,
    distribution maps of Tc and NRCT were generated for winter wheat and summer maize
    at different growth stages. The distribution maps were compared using the tabulate
    area tool to verify the temporal and spatial variation in crop water deficit.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Influence of the sampling time interval on the
    semivariogram function of Tc The fitted results for the semivariogram function
    of Tc at different sampling time intervals are shown in Table 1. The best fitted
    models were exponential and Gaussian for summer maize and winter wheat, respectively,
    in most cases. When the sampling time interval was equal to or greater than 10 min,
    the fitted model changed on some dates. According to the values of RNS, Tc showed
    strong or moderate spatial autocorrelation at different sampling time intervals
    except at site 1 on August 5 at the 13 min sampling time interval. This was consistent
    with the results of Yates et al. (1983), who stated that spatial correlation should
    be taken into account when analyzing Tc data. The determination coefficients of
    the best fitting model of the semivariogram function decreased as sampling time
    interval increased. When the sampling time interval was within 8 min, the determination
    coefficients of Tc were greater than 0.8, while when the sampling time interval
    was extended to 20 min, namely, when the number of sampling points was less than
    100, the determination coefficients decreased to 0.24. This indicated that the
    representativeness of the spatial variation in Tc gradually decreased with the
    increasing sampling time interval. Table 1. Semivariance functions of Tc at different

    time interval on the nRMSE and correlation coefficient of Tc The nRMSE and correlation
    coefficient of Tc between the measured and predicted values at different sampling
    time intervals determined with the OK interpolation method are shown in Fig. 4.
    The nRMSE of Tc was less than 7% at the different sampling time intervals, indicating
    excellent interpolation for both sites. In particular, when the sampling time
    interval was less than or equal to 5 min, the variation in the nRMSE was within
    0.5% at site 1 and within 1% at site 2. The nRMSE tended to increase with increasing
    of sampling time interval except on August 5 and August 22. The reason that the
    nRMSE did not decreased on these two days might be related to the high rainfall
    before these two days, during which the soil water content was high (Fig. 2).

    Fig. 4. nRMSE and correlation coefficient (r) of Tc between the measured and predicted
    values at different sampling time intervals and measuring dates during the growing
    seasons of summer maize at site 1 and winter wheat at site 2. The correlation
    coefficient between the predicted and measured Tc decreased with increasing sampling
    time interval for both sites. When the sampling time interval was greater than
    20 min, the correlation coefficient was low and could be reduced to −0.08, verifying
    that a sampling time of less than 100 could not guarantee the reliability of spatial
    prediction (Webster et al., 1992). The largest correlation coefficient was obtained
    with the smallest sampling time interval, which reached 0.89. Compared with the
    correlation coefficient at site 2 for winter wheat, it decreased faster with the
    extension of the sampling time interval at site 1. When the sampling time interval
    was less than or equal to 5 min, the correlation coefficient decreased slightly,
    with a maximum difference of 0.25 at site 1 and 0.05 at site 2. 3.3. Influence
    of the sampling time interval on the NRCT distribution maps Taking summer maize
    on August 27 and winter wheat on May 17 as examples, NRCT distribution maps at
    different sampling time intervals are shown in Fig. 5. The spatial distribution
    of the NRCT was basically the same when the sampling time interval was within
    5 min. When the sampling time interval was greater than 5 min, the distribution
    maps of the NRCT gradually distorted. The same phenomenon was also observed in
    the Tc distribution maps at different sampling time intervals (not shown). This
    result demonstrated that the sampling time should be within 5 min. Notably, bullseye
    patterns with rings of different sizes appeared in the distribution maps, which
    may be caused by the low uniformity of the sprinkler system and the heterogeneous
    physical and chemical properties of the soil. Download : Download high-res image

    by Eq. 2 at different sampling time intervals. To quantify the differences in
    the NRCT distribution maps, the overlap percentages of the same grades for a given
    sampling time interval were calculated based on those of the minimum sampling
    time intervals (Table 2). With the extension of the sampling time interval, the
    percentage of overlap decreased. When the sampling time interval was less than
    or equal to 5 min, the overlapping percentage ranged from 79% to 95%, and the
    average overlap percentage was 88%. It was reduced to 69% under 26 min. Table

    maps NRCT distribution maps of summer maize and winter wheat on different observation
    days were generated under a sampling time interval of 5 min (Fig. 6, Fig. 7),
    and the overlap percentage of the same grades for any two days were calculated
    (Table 3). The minimum overlap percentage was 43% for summer maize on August 22
    and August 27, and the maximum value was 67% for summer maize on August 5 and
    August 22. The results indicated that there was great spatiotemporal variability
    in crop water stress before the soil moisture content reached the lower limit.
    The same phenomenon was observed when the VRI was initiated (Zhu, 2023), indicating
    that there was temporal and spatial variation in crop water deficit. Download

    irrigation system are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, and and irrigation amount
    is shown in Table 4. Although there were some differences in the management zones,
    the distribution trends and the irrigation amounts under the two canopy temperature
    acquisition methods were similar and the average irrigation amounts was equal.
    The feasibility of using IRTs mounted on sprinkler irrigation systems with a maximum

    0.36 I 0.34 I Mean 0.37 I 0.37 I Moreover, according to Eq. 2, the disadvantage
    of NRCT is that if the crop encounters high stress (and therefore high temperature)
    anywhere in the overall image, it would rescale the entire image; thus, the NRCT
    is dependent on the range of water status within the image. Taking an average
    value of Tc for each management zone would mitigate the effect of excessively
    high canopy temperature. This demonstrated that more sampling points were needed
    in each management zone. From Fig. 3, we can see that for a center pivot sprinkler
    system, the analysis of the sampling time interval was mainly for the outermost
    sensors. For different center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems, when the traveling
    speed and sampling time interval are the same, the traveling distance of the outermost
    sensor is the same, and more sampling points are obtained in a larger sprinkler
    system than in two spans. This verified that the recommended sampling time interval
    of less than 5 min was feasible for any center pivot sprinkler system. 4. Conclusions
    Monitoring Tc and generating VRI prescription maps are important steps in dynamic
    VRI management. In this study, the sampled Tc and calculated NRCT at various time
    intervals were interpolated by ArcGIS software during the growing seasons of summer
    maize and winter wheat to study the reasonable sampling time interval. Simultaneously,
    a method of generating VRI prescription maps was proposed, and the accuracy of
    VRI prescription maps based on IRTs mounted on a moving sprinkler irrigation system
    and the recommended sampling time interval were compared with those obtained by
    a UAV thermal imaging system. The results indicated that the sampling time interval
    should not exceed 5 minutes, and the VRI prescription maps generated by the UAV
    thermal imaging system and the IRTs mounted on the sprinkler irrigation system
    were similar. It demonstrates techniques for collecting IRT data but does not
    expand into a full VRI program based on these data to prove the feasibility of
    using IRTs mounted on sprinkler irrigation systems for precision VRI. It is necessary
    to conduct field experiments using this method for further research. CRediT authorship

    becoming an increasingly crucial decision-making task whose goal is to achieve
    effective and efficient use of water (Saggi and Jain, 2022). The crop quality
    and yield are significantly dependent on the amount of water and timing. The objective
    of irrigation scheduling is to apply an adequate amount of water at the right
    time to a specific crop. However, according to a survey by the US Department of
    Agriculture, more than 75% of irrigation scheduling methods applied by farmers
    in the US are based on the Checkbook method (Vellidis et al., 2016), and the condition
    of crops such as visual observations, crop calendars and observing what the neighbors
    are doing (USDA, 2017). Inefficient irrigation scheduling methods may result in
    over-irrigation or under-irrigation. Consequently, water scarcity, nutrient leaching,
    and increased soil salinity if groundwater is used for irrigation can be observed
    in over-irrigated regions or yield an economic loss in under-irrigated farms.
    Science- and technology-based irrigation scheduling approaches, as opposed to
    the Checkbook method or the condition of crop method, may boost crop profit while
    reducing environmental consequences by limiting crop water stress (Zhang et al.,
    2021). Model-based crop water demand assessment falls under three categories,
    deterministic methods, process-based models, and machine learning (ML) methods.
    Deterministic methods such as FAO-56 calculate irrigation water demand based on
    crop evapotranspiration approaches (Allen et al., 2005). Process-based models
    such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Aquacrop, Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator
    (APSIM) usually determine crop water requirement by simulating biophysical processes
    leading to plants’ growth in the soil-plant-atmosphere system using mathematical
    formulations of those processes. ML models, on the other hand, are data-driven,
    they estimate irrigation needs by learning the hidden function that relates input
    weather and soil data to crop water demands. All techniques have been applied
    in irrigation scheduling for different crops in various regions across the globe.
    However, process-based models are highly sensitive to uncertainties associated
    with physical processes such as initial and boundary conditions and spatiotemporal
    variability of soil moisture conditions than are deterministic and ML models (Karandish
    and Šimůnek, 2016, Gumiere et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020). Consequently, process-based
    models need extensive and constant calibration as new data are generated to accurately
    compute irrigation needs. Furthermore, process-based models are more suitable
    for irrigation planning than for real-time irrigation decision-making (Gu et al.,
    2020). Process-based models lack a way to explicitly enhance real-time soil moisture
    prediction by incorporating weather forecasts or feedback from soil moisture sensors.
    For instance, SWAT has shown consistent overestimation of the irrigation amount
    when used for irrigation scheduling which compromises the model’s accuracy in
    automated irrigation control (Sun and Ren, 2014, Maier and Dietrich, 2016). Fortunately,
    real-time irrigation prediction and scheduling can be achieved thanks to technological
    developments such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that enhance data availability
    and the increased computational power enabling the operation of ML models in real-time.
    Examples of such applications include an irrigation system developed by Glória
    et al. (2021) to attain the best water-saving schedule using real-time data, and
    smart irrigation strategies that predict irrigation water use using several ML
    algorithms (see Tace et al., 2022). The application of ML in irrigation scheduling
    promoted agricultural productivity and water use efficiency (Hunsaker et al.,
    2005, Karasekreter et al., 2013, Nachankar et al., 2018, Nawandar and Satpute,
    2019, Jamroen et al., 2020, Jimenez et al., 2020). With novel data collection
    techniques, the quantity of available data at a finer spatial-temporal scale,
    also known as big data, has increased in an unprecedented way (Donratanapat et
    al., 2020, Huang et al., 2019). Big data can be leveraged to find appropriate
    solutions for the problems faced by farmers (García et al., 2020), such as water
    shortage, and crop and cost management (Elijah et al., 2018). ML technologies
    can be leveraged to use big data for irrigation water use simulation. Indeed,
    the integration of ML technologies with big data enables irrigation estimation
    to be undertaken in more intelligent and efficient ways hence ensuring water sustainability
    for the growing world’s population (Sharma et al., 2021). Recent studies have
    investigated how ML can benefit the agricultural sectors by improving irrigation
    systems (Nemali and van Iersel, 2006, Liu et al., 2021). ML has been used to improve
    traditional ways of carrying out agricultural activities such as irrigation control
    and management (Tseng et al., 2018, Dahane et al., 2020, Torres-Sanchez et al.,
    2020). Indeed, ML has been employed to build intelligent data-driven models and
    provide the best solution for irrigation scheduling by learning the hidden relationship
    in datasets. The outcomes of the ML irrigation model can benefit farmers in numerous
    ways. ML algorithms can predict irrigation water requirements based on the study
    of evaporation processes through collected data and determine soil moisture variations
    over time. The soil moisture content can then be used as an indicator of when
    and how much to irrigate. This information can provide early intelligence to farmers
    to enhance their irrigation decisions. Currently, there are several ML methods
    available to predict irrigation water demand that have been applied in different
    farm settings. Liou et al. (2001) were among the first scholars who applied ML
    models, i.e., an error-propagation learning back-propagation neural network, to
    estimate soil moisture from simulated brightness temperature. In a sequence, Dibike
    et al. (2001) demonstrated the potential of support vector machine (SVM) to outperform
    artificial neural network (ANN) in remote sensing image classification and regression
    problems. Gill et al. (2006) used SVM to predict soil moisture in four to seven
    days ahead of time using historical data with forecasts that were quite comparable
    to the actual soil moisture measurements. In another study, Shrestha and Shukla
    (2015) utilized SVM to estimate crop evapotranspiration using lysimeter-based
    measurements for vine and erect crops to train the model. They found that the
    SVM model surpassed ANN and boosted the accuracy of FAO-56 crop evapotranspiration
    estimates by 4%. Soil moisture measurements became possible with the emergence
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the availability of enhanced and more accessible
    soil sensing and field communication technology (Kamienski et al., 2018, García
    et al., 2020). Major drawbacks of ML algorithms, however, are massive data requirement,
    black-boxiness, uncertainty associated with simulation(Tabas and Samadi, 2022),
    automatically deducing the features, and optimally tuning them for the desired
    outcomes (e.g., Windheuser et al., 2023). Overfitting and bias are two other common
    deficiencies in ML algorithms. Overfitting is a major issue in ML and occurs when
    a model cannot generalize well on unseen data during the testing period. Over-fitted
    models tend to capture all the trends in the data, including unavoidable noise
    on the training set, instead of learning the hidden relationship between features.
    The main causes of overfitting are noisy data, insufficient training data, and
    model complexities. In this review paper, we discuss existing opportunities to
    address these issues and provide a path for future ML research in irrigation decision-making.
    This review paper aims to (i) assess how ML has been used as an intelligent simulation
    model to promote water management in the irrigation sector, (ii) discuss the results
    of ML models applied in various agricultural water use simulation research, and
    (iii) highlight the limitations that hinder the effective performance of ML models
    in irrigation prediction and scheduling. By doing so, we discussed the applicability
    of various ML algorithms in irrigation management, articulated their weakness
    and strengths, and identified the knowledge gaps and the next steps to promote
    the application of these intelligent algorithms in irrigation scheduling. The
    remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief introduction
    to ML as well as the most used algorithms in irrigation prediction. Section 3
    presents surveyed studies that used ML approaches in irrigation-related studies.
    Section 4 presents existing limitations in the use of ML models and how they can
    be addressed, Section 5 highlights different ways to add physics into ML models,
    while Section 6 discusses major results from developed irrigation tools. Section
    7 draws major conclusion of the paper. 2. Machine learning modelling concepts
    ML, defined as \"the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically
    through experience and by using data\" (Mitchell, 2007), has been used in agriculture
    due to the increased availability of data and the need to improve traditional
    farming practices. IoT is an emerging technology that uses smart sensors and devices
    interconnected through the internet to collect data and transmit them to a server
    with no or limited human intervention. As such, it allows continuous monitoring
    and management of soil and climate conditions and promotes efficient farm management.
    ML and IoT enable big data collection and modeling, and farm machinery modernization
    that gives rise to precision agriculture, also known as smart farming. Precision
    agriculture is the use of up-to-date information technologies, smart devices,
    and software tools to support decision-making in agriculture (Pierce and Nowak,
    1999). It aims at increasing the farm’s profitability by reducing the cost of
    production while improving environmental sustainability. ML algorithms fall under
    three categories, as illustrated by Fig. 1: supervised learning, unsupervised
    learning, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. In supervised learning,
    the developed model uses information from labeled inputs and outputs to find the
    functional relationships between them. Supervised learning can be used to predict
    categorical output values in which case a classification algorithm is used, on
    the other hand, if the value to be predicted is numerical, a regression algorithm
    can be used. In the unsupervised learning category, the learning algorithm uses
    unlabelled datasets to find the pattern that maps inputs to outputs. RL uses an
    agent to make a decision by interacting with the environment aiming at finding
    proper actions that maximize rewards and minimize penalties through trial and
    error. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, is also illustrated in Fig. 1. DL models
    can abstract features from high dimensional time series datasets and use multiple
    layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input data.
    This review paper is mostly focused on broader ML models, even though some review
    examples of DL models for irrigation demand modeling are also provided. Download

    Different types of ML algorithms. Three key steps are followed in building ML
    models to perform prediction tasks (see Fig. 2). Firstly, the input data is pre-processed
    by carrying out data cleaning to remove noise and missing data using data transformation
    methods such as discretization or normalization. The model is then trained and
    calibrated with the training dataset to find the function that relates the inputs
    to the outputs by determining a set of parameters that give the best results (Mahesh,
    2018, Oden Technologies, 2023). After this process, a new dataset (validation
    dataset) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Once an overall satisfactory
    performance is achieved, the model can be tested on an unseen dataset, the performance
    of the testing period determines ML''s ability to accurately perform a task based
    on the learned experience. Supervised learning and RL are recently used for irrigation
    water use modeling which are discussed in the following sections. Download : Download

    of ML approaches for irrigation water use modelling. 2.1. Machine learning algorithms
    commonly used in irrigation scheduling Most ML algorithms for regression problems
    estimate a mapping function that can predict the output variables (Y) for new
    input data (X). Some popular examples of ML algorithms are Linear Regression,
    Random Forest (RF), Boosting Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, and Long Short-term
    Memory (LSTM). Here we briefly explain different ML models. Readers are referred
    to Kecman (2005), Kavitha et al. (2016), and Tabas and Samadi (2022) for more
    details on ML algorithms. 2.1.1. Random forest Inspired by the work of Amit and
    Geman (1997), Breiman (2001) introduced RF. RF is a collection of tree-structured
    classifiers {h(x, ѳk), k = 1,…} formed based on a set of input vectors (X = X1,
    X2, …, Xn) and random vectors (ѳk) sampled independently but with a similar distribution
    to find a prediction function (f(X)) that can accurately predict the variable
    of interest (Y). RF can be used to solve classification or regression problems.
    After multiple (k) runs, the majority vote of the predictions given by each tree
    is the answer for classification problems whereas the predictions'' average is
    considered the model output for regression problems. Fig. 3 illustrates the workflow
    of RF simulation. The accuracy of the prediction function is given by the loss
    function L (Y, f(X)) which is a measure of the closeness of f(X) to Y. Thus, the
    optimum prediction function minimizes the expected value of the loss function
    EXY (L, f(X)). Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download : Download

    Boosting is a type of ensemble method that builds a good performing model (strong
    learner) by adding up several models in an attempt to combine multiple simulations
    until an accurate prediction is achieved or a maximum number of models are added.
    This is done in a sequential learning process where each model learns from the
    errors of its predecessor and tries to correct them. Popular Boosting ensemble
    models include Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB).
    In the Adaboost, observations are weighted, and less weight is given to instances
    already well classified whereas those that are more difficult to classify are
    given more weight to be handled by new learners. GTB uses a loss function such
    as squared error to minimize the error as models are added up. 2.1.3. Long short-term
    memory LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) developed by Hochreiter
    and Schmidhuber (1997). Unlike the traditional RNN, LSTM networks allow information
    to persist, thus managing the problem of the vanishing gradient in the traditional
    RNN. The LSTM has a hidden state known as short-term memory and an additional
    cell state, which is the long-term memory. The main attribute of LSTM networks
    is that they can remember information for a long time. Fig. 4 illustrates the
    structure of an LSTM network. As illustrated, the information flow is regulated
    by three gates; the forget gate determines if the information from the previous
    time step should be kept or forgotten, the input gate learns new information from
    the current time step and adds it to the cell, and the output gate that transmits
    the updated information from the current time step to the next one. Download :

    Reinforcement learning algorithms RL is an ML approach where the algorithm learns
    how to map situations to actions by interacting with its environment to attain
    a goal. This continuous interaction with the environment forms a closed loop problem
    solving system where the selected actions depend on learned experience through
    a series of interactions with the environment and the rewards received per each
    action chosen (see Fig. 5). The goal of the RL algorithm is to maximize the cumulative
    rewards through the interactive feedback mechanism that differentiates RL from
    other ML algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. RL agent and its interaction with a physical environment
    (i.e., a farm system). RL uses a mathematical model, i.e., the Markov Decision
    Process (MDP), to solve a problem. MDP uses a property that enables the next state
    and reward to be computed given that the current state and action are known. More
    precisely, the agent interacts with the environment in a time sequence of discrete
    time steps. At each time step t, the agent receives the current state of the environment
    with S being the set of all possible states and then selects an action where represents
    actions that can be taken in state . Following the action taken, the agent will
    then be given a reward and the environment transits to a new state . The goal
    of the agent is to maximize the cumulative rewards received from the environment.
    The measure of the values of possible action “a” at state “s” pairs that can be
    taken by the algorithm is determined by a value function . This function can be
    optimized through a series of iterations to give the optimal state action pair
    that results in the highest reward at each time step. For complex environments
    with a high dimensional state-action space, the value function (Q-value) is not
    suitable for defining the reward of each pair. Consequently, a more advanced RL
    algorithm known as Deep Q-Network (DQN) consisting of a combination of Q-learning
    and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is used to solve such complex problems. Instead
    of determining the cumulative reward based on the value function table, DQN leverages
    DNN to approximate the Q-values, the network takes the environment state as input
    and predicts the Q-values for each action. Focusing on RL applications in irrigation
    water use simulation, researchers define the state as actual observations to determine
    a sequence of optimal irrigation that is related to a farm’s environment such
    as soil moisture, crop growth status, and weather conditions. The agent, which
    is the learner and decision maker, is represented by the irrigation system while
    actions are the various choices made by the agent on the amount of irrigation
    water to apply. The reward function (R) is the profit made at the end of the season
    after the expenses associated with irrigating are covered and the goal of the
    agent is to perform a set of actions that maximizes this profit. 3. Literature
    review The literature review focused on collecting a wide selection of refereed
    journals from major publishers. A total of 56 publications were initially found.
    Among them, 16 studies were selected as they were more relevant to the application
    of ML algorithms in irrigation prediction and decision-making. These 16 studies
    are discussed as follows. Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) were the first scholars
    to use Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Systems
    (ANFIS) to predict the weekly irrigation run time of three drip irrigated citrus
    plantations in Spain. The goal was to find the irrigation duration that maximizes
    the yield while optimally managing water. Using volumetric water content, soil
    water potential and crop evapotranspiration as input data, the predicted irrigation
    run time by the two models were evaluated against irrigation reports provided
    by an agronomist. Both models accurately predicted the irrigation pattern followed
    by the agronomist but ANFIS outperformed PLSR by giving a better estimation of
    weekly irrigation amount. Sun et al. (2017) developed a RL algorithm to perform
    irrigation planning and scheduling. A neural network was used to emulate DSSAT
    in predicting seasonal total soil water content using irrigation and weather information
    as input. A second neural network was then used to predict crop yield using the
    predicted total soil water content. The crop yield prediction was then used as
    the training data to train the RL model. Soil moisture and yield were predicted
    to train the model and find the optimal irrigation schedule that maximizes the
    net return (see Equation 1). The net return was then taken into consideration
    in the model to measure economic gain and adapt to future changes in the produce
    and water price. The model was tested by simulating maize planted fields in Temple,
    Texas, (USA), Kunnunurra (Australia), Hyderabad, (India), and for wheat yield
    prediction in Saskatchewan (Canada). The predicted total soil water results were
    used by an irrigation controller to apply an adaptive amount of water as needed.
    This technique enabled automatic irrigation and surpassed threshold and fixed-based
    irrigation in the tested locations by achieving a higher net return. The developed
    irrigation system addresses the dynamic and complex nature of irrigation scheduling
    and control by taking into consideration the current and future soil water content
    variations to adaptively optimize irrigation schedules which is a significant
    contribution to improved water efficiency in irrigation systems. Its limitation,
    however, is that it is restricted to a small total soil water space and is not
    suitable for large-scale problems (continuous soil water space). Furthermore,
    the proposed system has not been tested with actual field conditions, therefore
    its performance cannot be validated in real applications. Net return = yield (kg/ha)
    * price of product (dollars/kg) – water use (ha-mm/ha) * price of water (dollars/mm)
    Equation 1. Kumar et al. (2017) created a fully automated intelligent irrigation
    system based on IoT to gather temperature, soil moisture, and raindrop sensor
    data. The data collected is used by a microcontroller for analysis of the irrigation
    needs of several crops including beans, curry leaves, lady fingers, moringa, and
    radish. A motor is activated for irrigating the field when moisture values drop
    below a threshold range. Using recorded temperature and water flow data, a linear
    regressor is used to predict the next irrigation water requirement. The system
    then schedules irrigation based on the irrigation amount predicted by activating/deactivating
    a relay which in turn activates or deactivates a solenoid valve as needed. The
    linear regression model is updated in case there is a change in the data. The
    system also includes a mobile app that enables users to have access to field data
    remotely. The performance of the system was, however, not compared to other irrigation
    demand assessment approaches, nor did the authors specify how much water can be
    saved. This work contributed to advancing the automation of irrigation systems
    to enable remote monitoring and control. Its innovative incorporation of IoT technology
    with ML for water demand assessment and scheduling was a stepping stone for achieving
    better results in water use optimization with limited labor. Goap et al. (2018)
    developed a smart irrigation system based on IoT and ML techniques. A combination
    of sensor-collected field data such as soil moisture, soil temperature, Ultraviolet
    (UV) light radiation, and weather forecast data including precipitation, air temperature,
    and other variables, was used to compute future soil moisture based on which irrigation
    requirements were determined. The smart irrigation architecture consists of an
    IoT data collection system that collects, transmits, and processes sensor data
    and weather forecasts. A soil moisture prediction algorithm was developed as a
    combination of SVR and k-means clustering algorithms that calculate soil moisture
    change due to weather conditions. An irrigation scheduling algorithm then takes
    the predicted daily soil moisture, retrieves precipitation information to find
    the nearest day it is expected to rain, and computes the required soil moisture
    to maintain crop growth. If the required soil moisture is below the minimum threshold
    a command is sent to a relay switch to start the water motor and vice versa. A
    responsive web portal is used to view the projected soil moisture along with expected
    rainfall and to start or stop irrigation. The algorithm achieved a correlation
    coefficient and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.56 and 0.135 respectively, when
    estimated soil moisture deficit (SMD) was compared to sensor-based SMD. The limitation
    of this work is that no water-saving analysis was performed to assess its potential
    against other systems. Additionally, the experiment was performed in a garden,
    so there is no record of its performance on a larger area such as a farm system.
    On the other hand, the study exemplifies how fully autonomous smart irrigation
    systems can be developed using sensor-collected data and weather forecasts to
    run ML algorithms and predict water demand. Concurrently, Goldstein et al. (2018)
    used regression and classification algorithms to build an ML model based on sensor
    and weather data to predict irrigation quantities for jojoba-planted fields in
    Israel as prescribed by an agronomist. These data were subdivided into eight subsets
    of different features to determine the accuracy of the models when inputs were
    changed. LR, Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT), and Boosted Tree Classifier
    (BTC) were used to estimate irrigation water demands. The models were evaluated
    on their ability to provide an irrigation value that is not more than 0.2 mm above
    or below the agronomist’s one. It was observed that LR performed unsatisfactorily
    giving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equal to 0.466 and a performance accuracy
    of 52.3%. GBRT outperformed LR as the lowest RMSE was 0.11 and the accuracy rate
    reached 92.7%. The BTC algorithm also performed well with an accuracy of 95%.
    It was concluded that non-parametric models perform well compared to LR methods
    in cases where there is a non-linear functional relationship between the dependent
    and independent variables. The authors also observed that the model run with less
    input data (such as the model run without saturation/drought data) provided quite
    similar results to the model in which all the variables were used to train the
    model highlighting the fact that selecting appropriate features is more important
    in achieving satisfactory performance. In another study, Adeyemi et al. (2018)
    developed a predictive irrigation scheduling system using the Feed Forward Neural
    Network (FFNN) model and LSTM. A neural network (NN) model was used to predict
    the one-day-ahead volumetric soil moisture using historical soil moisture and
    climatic data. Based on the predicted soil moisture, crop water requirement, and
    soil water retention, the irrigation depth and timing were determined for a potato
    field. According to the obtained results, the two models performed comparably
    on the validation datasets and provided better predictions than those of a non-ML
    approach that estimates the soil moisture from the average of previously observed
    three-day soil moisture values. However, the LSTM model outperformed the FFNN
    model in terms of regression coefficient when datasets from different sites were
    used. This showed the robustness of LSTM networks in approximating the underlying
    functional relationship between inputs and outputs for situations similar to the
    learned ones. The LSTM model was coupled with AQUACROP to simulate potato crop
    growth and develop a predictive irrigation scheduling system whose goal was to
    maintain the soil moisture within a set of upper and lower boundaries during the
    simulation period. Given the predicted soil moisture, the deficit amount of water
    to reach the upper bound was computed and the irrigation amount was defined as
    the water depth needed to replenish the soil to attain the set threshold. The
    system was compared with a rule-based irrigation system, the former achieved a
    water saving of more than 20% in the three tested sites compared to the latter
    while maintaining the same water use efficiency. Using daily climatic data and
    daily irrigation amount collected in a period of one year, Perea et al., 2019
    developed a model to predict irrigation amount based on farmers’ decisions about
    when to irrigate. The crops grown in the area were drip-irrigated tomato and maize
    and rice, which was flood-irrigated. The purpose of the model was to simulate
    the occurrence of irrigation one day ahead as planned by farmers. This model was
    developed using DT and optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal
    DT that accurately simulates farmers’ behavior. Based on the defined objective
    functions, three Classification Trees (CT; CT1, CT2, and CT3) were selected. The
    first CT (CT1) outperformed other DTs by accurately predicting all the observed
    irrigation and no irrigation events, achieving a performance accuracy of 100%
    in both cases. CT2 followed with an accurate classification of 73% of the irrigation
    rates and 93% of no irrigation rates. Lastly, CT3 was able to classify 68% of
    the actual irrigation rates and 93% of no irrigation rates. The developed model
    contributes to irrigation management by providing information on when to schedule
    irrigation and hence could help in better coordinating irrigation activities to
    minimize energy and water loss. Weekly irrigation amounts of orchards of citrus
    trees (orange, mandarina and lemon trees) located in Southeast Spain were predicted
    using a modelling system driven by LR, a random forest regressor (RFR), and SVR
    algorithms (Torres-Sanchez et al., 2020). These algorithms were trained to perform
    the irrigation assessment, as such the goal was to imitate the irrigation recommendations
    of an agronomist. Using the daily average matric potential of the previous five
    days, the total water needs, whether the fruit is gaining weight or not expressed
    as a binary value as input the ML models were trained to output the total irrigation
    amount recommended by the agronomists for the following week. The results were
    compared with irrigation prescriptions by agronomists. Results showed that RFR
    performs better than SVR and LR with an RMSE of 16.83m3, 17.13m3, and 19.5m3,
    respectively. A weekly average error of 9% was obtained when the predicted irrigation
    amount was compared with the agronomist’s report. To overcome the drawbacks of
    traditional RL models such as Q - Network (QN), Yang et al. (2020) proposed a
    deep Q - Network (DQN) to control irrigation scheduling. The difference between
    QN and DQN is that the former generates the value function table while learning
    from the data whereas the latter uses ANNs to compute the value function from
    multi-dimensional input data. Hence ANNs offer the possibility to handle a large
    amount of data and precisely render the irrigation scheduling problem more scalable.
    The environment was interfaced by AQUACROP, and simulations were conducted using
    three crops namely maize, wheat, and soybean. The state of the environment was
    described by the date, crop stage, precipitation, reference ET, total water content
    in the effective root zone, stomatal water content, and irrigation. Actions consisted
    of irrigation amounts from 0 mm to 10 mm with a 0.5 mm increment. Results demonstrated
    that the suggested algorithm outperformed traditional irrigation approaches such
    as constant irrigation, and percentage available water in dry, moderate, and wet
    weather conditions and was closest to the Q learning estimation for dry conditions.
    Coupling AQUACROP with DQN for irrigation scheduling allowed for a more comprehensive
    assessment of crop water demand by enabling the simulation of different crop growth
    scenarios based on the applied irrigation amount. This integration also addresses
    the data scarcity issue often encountered in ML modeling. The system was however
    not directly tested on the farm, the replication of results as far as implementation
    is concerned is thus not ascertained. To determine the right set of features to
    use for determining the irrigation scheduling of a drip-irrigated rice field from
    weather parameters based on ML, Sidhu et al. (2020) used correlation to identify
    the dependencies in the data and guide the selection of feature sets. Features
    with a correlation of 0.7 and above were discarded. The variables found useful
    and used as input features for irrigation scheduling were number of days after
    sowing, maximum temperature, dry bulb at 6:00 AM, humidity at 2:00 PM, soil temperature
    20 cm below surface at 2:00 PM, sunshine hours, wind speed, wind direction, ET,
    number of days since last rain and number of days since last irrigation. Among
    different algorithms used in their study, Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) and Adaboost
    outperformed other algorithms. As noted by Goldstein et al. (2018), LR was unable
    to perform well in predicting irrigation demand. It was also demonstrated that
    Adaboost could perform equally well with a limited number of selected input features.
    Zhou (2020) proposed an RL method that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    to estimate the value function used to train the DQN algorithm. The algorithm
    uses sensor-collected soil data such as moisture and humidity, air temperature
    and air humidity, leaf water potential, and leaf conductance collected from a
    grape-growing greenhouse plantation as input features to train the model. The
    system improved irrigation decision-making on the plantation with no human intervention.
    To overcome the limited learning capability of some previously developed ML models,
    Kashyap et al. (2021) created a Deep Learning Intelligent Irrigation System for
    precision Agriculture (DLiSA) based on NN and IoT-enabled approaches that account
    for climate and soil moisture variations. The system comprises the one-day-ahead
    soil water content predicted by an LSTM model, an irrigation scheduler to compute
    the volume of irrigation water, and an irrigation planner to calculate the duration
    of the irrigation period and the water delivery across the field. Irrigation commands
    are then passed to the actuator nodes from which they get to the water valves.
    The particularity of this system is that it integrates feedback from climate and
    soil sensors which enables it to adapt to local changes and perform well during
    historical periods. A comparison of this irrigation system with those obtained
    with a threshold-based irrigation model and an FFNN showed that 43% and 23% of
    water volume, respectively are saved using DLiSA. Jimenez et al. (2021) used LSTM
    with soil matric potential (SMP) collected at three soil depths (i.e., 150, 300,
    and 600 mm), rainfall, and irrigation amounts as input data to predict irrigation
    schedules during a corn-growing season for sandy clay loam and loamy fine sand
    soils for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in advance. In addition, three different LSTM
    models were developed by changing inputs to evaluate the predictability of LSTM
    networks concerning the input data. The input data used for the first model were
    SMP at 150-, 300-, and 600-mm soil depths, management zone, rain, and previously
    applied irrigation; the second model used SMP and management zone, whereas the
    third model only used SMP as input. The results indicated that the same error
    and predictability level obtained for the first model can also be obtained using
    only SMP data. In terms of temporal models’ performance, the 1-hour ahead irrigation
    predictions were accurately predicted the same as the three and six hours-ahead,
    but the accuracy gradually decreased for irrigation predictions of 12- and 24-hours
    advance causing overfitting or underfitting. Nevertheless, it was concluded that
    irrigation prescriptions changes can be accurately forecasted on time by LSTM.
    The authors also noted that using rainfall and irrigation data as input caused
    overfitting in the testing period. This is because rainfall patterns change over
    time and those rainfall amount fluctuations might be unknown for the model. Y.
    Chen et al., 2021 combined several classifiers to form a strong irrigation predicting
    approach using stacking and boosting ensemble learning methods. The model was
    developed to predict irrigation volumes for multiple fields in a greenhouse of
    organic vegetables. Air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature, soil humidity,
    and light intensity data were used as input variables to linear SVR, Support Vector
    Classification (SVC), RF, and DT. Model performances of 0.45, 0.675, 0.645, and
    0.54 were obtained for each model, respectively. Stacked generalization was employed
    to combine the advantages of these algorithms using extreme gradient boosting
    (XGBoost) which improved the performance from 0.58 to 0.64. The best performance
    was obtained when simulated and observed water volumes were compared with 3.33
    and 8.16 for the MAE and RMSE, respectively. Concurrently, Deep Q learning was
    implemented by M. Chen et al., 2021 to perform irrigation scheduling for paddy
    rice using short-term weather forecasts. The input features defining the field
    environment on a daily basis consisted of one week forecasted rain sequence, water
    depth as well as minimum and maximum thresholds of water depth and the maximum
    allowable water depth where the maximum allowable water depth and the maximum
    threshold are determined based on the growth stage. The three irrigation actions
    that are defined to irrigate were no irrigation, supplying 50% or 100% of the
    water needed to attain the maximum water depth. Results showed that no yield losses
    were experienced in the studied period. The DQN was able to consider current field
    water conditions and weather forecasts to efficiently choose to irrigate or delay
    irrigation in order to avoid under or over irrigation which resulted in water
    conservation and increased rainfall use. Comparing irrigation with the flooded
    irrigation strategy, the DQN method reduced water use by 23 mm. This research
    demonstrates how advanced computational techniques based on ML can enhance irrigation
    prediction. By applying weather forecasts in crop water demand assessment to limit
    unnecessary irrigation, more water is conserved compared to conventional irrigation
    methods. The study also underscores the ability of the applied algorithm to optimize
    water despite imperfect weather forecasts thanks to its ability to learn from
    past irrigation experiences and weather forecast uncertainties. More recently,
    Alibabaei et al. (2022) trained a DQN to schedule and optimize irrigation for
    a tomato field. The state of the environment was expressed by a combination of
    average temperature, average relative humidity, precipitation, reference evapotranspiration,
    average wind speed, total soil water in profile, and irrigation amount. Actions
    consisted of irrigation amounts ranging from 0 to 60 mm - ha/ha. The agent environment
    was simulated by two LSTM models. One was to predict the one-day soil moisture
    in advance and the other was used to approximate the seasonal harvest based on
    the growing season environmental conditions and then determine the net return.
    To estimate the Q-table, an ANN, an LSTM, and a CNN were used. LSTM surpassed
    other algorithms because it memorized previous input data and used the retained
    information in the subsequent time steps. The results achieved by the developed
    algorithm showed an increase in the productivity in the test field and a reduction
    of irrigation water in comparison to threshold-based and fixed irrigation by 18%
    to 30%. The crucial finding of this study that showcases the strength of ML models
    is the ability of the developed irrigation system to adapt irrigation scheduling
    to the crop growth stages. At the beginning of the season, the system avoids water
    losses by adopting a lower water supply scheduling which gradually increases as
    the season progresses and eventually reduces to stress the plants towards the
    harvest period. This ensures that enough water is available to sustain the plants
    during the critical growth period and minimizes water losses at the start and
    end of the season. The surveyed studies illustrate the ability of ML algorithms
    to make use of data from different sources including weather forecasts, to assess
    crop water demand and predict irrigation schedules in a more efficient way that
    optimizes water use compared to conventional approaches. The attained water efficiency
    is shown by the amount of water saved as opposed to traditional fixed period or
    threshold value irrigation techniques that do not account for spatial-temporal
    changes in soil, crop, and meteorological variables. With the real-time data acquisition
    approaches enabled by IoT and the progress made in coupling IoT with ML models
    as applied and demonstrated in the several presented studies, ML algorithms hold
    great potential for automating the irrigation decision-making process. This will
    improve further timely irrigation scheduling and eradicate the additional work
    of manually controlling irrigation systems. Applying ML models in irrigation decision-making
    and scheduling is also economically beneficial as the crop water waste, the cost
    of water, and labor demand are minimized. Table 1 summarizes the reviewed studies,
    the algorithm used, and the obtained model performance. Table 1. ML based irrigation

    in irrigation water use modeling 4.1. Data scarcity The performance of ML models
    highly depends on the availability of sufficient data to accurately learn the
    underlying relationship between the predictors and the variable to be predicted.
    Due to the high variability of soil and climatic conditions in space and time,
    data should be available at a fine spatial-temporal resolution for proper results
    to be obtained. Data availability is often a challenge as the collected data by
    sensors such as soil moisture, are point measurements and hence do not represent
    the entire field’s conditions. To obtain representative information about the
    field’s conditions and improve the performance of ML models, many sensors need
    to be installed across the field which can be expensive. In addition, satellite-derived
    data can be useful for irrigation prediction but often are not available at the
    field scale. Satellite data can be an alternative source of data, however, the
    frequency at which data is collected is usually low due to orbital paths. The
    collection of good-quality satellite data is also hindered by the effect of canopy
    or cloudy atmospheric conditions which leads to significant data gaps. Moreover,
    the spatial resolution of these data is sometimes not satisfactory. For instance,
    the presently operating soil moisture products are available at a coarse resolution
    that cannot be directly used in irrigation prediction at the field level if not
    downscaled (Zhang et al., 2021). On the other hand, downscaling data adds more
    uncertainties that can compromise the modeling results. The data scarcity problem
    can be addressed by integrating remote sensing and field sensors’ collected data
    to increase the reliability of simulated results. In the event of low sensor coverage,
    satellite-based measurements can help bridge the spatial-temporal data gap. Satellite
    data such as soil moisture, surface temperature, Leaf Area Index (LAI), etc. can
    be used to supplement sensor data in modeling field conditions after carefully
    downscaling the data to the field level. Satellite-based measurements can also
    be used to validate sensor-measured data by detecting outliers. Having a complete,
    reliable dataset would considerably improve the performance of ML models and allow
    farmers and Extension irrigation specialists to make more informed irrigation
    decisions. Furthermore, most models use soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling
    methods; thus, soil moisture is commonly used as an indicator of crop water stress.
    However, plant water stress-related indices can also be useful predictors to assess
    irrigation demand (Jones, 2004, Gu et al., 2020) but no significant work has been
    done to build ML models for irrigation predictions using these variables. Thus,
    data of either plant-water status, such as measurements of leaf/stem/xylem water
    potential and leaf thickness, or plant physiology, such as sap flow measurements
    by sensors, stomatal conductance, and plant thermal sensing, can potentially enhance
    data availability and irrigation prediction accuracy. In addition, data augmentation
    techniques have been proven to remediate the data scarcity problem. Specifically,
    image data can boost the performance of ML models in irrigation modeling and applications.
    Data augmentation techniques are mostly applied in crop-weed classification (Fawakherji
    et al., 2020, Su et al., 2021, Divyanth et al., 2022, Espejo-Garcia et al., 2023)
    and plant disease diagnosis (Wu et al., 2020, Cap et al., 2022, Huang et al.,
    2022) Data augmentation involves implementing a sequence of methodologies to generate
    new images from the existing image dataset. Data augmentation techniques fall
    into three categories; the first class involves basic augmentation techniques
    that increase the size of a dataset by changing the geometric position of points
    in an image hence generating a new data point examples of this technique are geometric
    transformations such as scaling, rotating, and skewing images. Noise injection
    techniques such as Gaussian or uniform noise are also common techniques to increase
    data samples. They entail adding noise to data to increase the variance. The deformable
    augmentation technique is the second category of data augmentation techniques
    that can be used when the basic techniques do not provide satisfactory variability
    and include methods such as spline interpolation, which uses a piecewise polynomial
    function to interpolate a new data point between two observed points. Using statistical
    shape models is another advanced method to generate new data by using observed
    data and a mathematical model to understand the dataset’s variability and implement
    changes within the limit of possible parameters. The third category of data augmentation
    techniques is generative DL techniques. These approaches increase the volume of
    data by learning features in a dataset to generate synthetic but realistic datasets.
    The most common DL networks are generative adversarial networks (GAN) and their
    variants. Adversarial learning refers to the contest between two NNs, a generator
    and a discriminator. The generator learns to generate new data such that the distribution
    of the generated data is as close as possible to that of the observed data. The
    discriminator, on the other hand, learns to evaluate the generated data and differentiate
    them from authentic data. In addition to increasing the sample size, these techniques
    reduce overfitting by introducing new patterns in the data that can make a model
    more generalizable. 4.2. Noisy and heterogeneous data Data is the foundation of
    every ML project. Hence, preprocessing data prior to their use is an important
    step to ensure data quality and reduce the possibility of defective data that
    hinder model efficiency. Data noise and heterogeneity are the common issues encountered
    during data collection and preprocessing. Raw data contains numerous flaws such
    as missing values, incorrect values, and incorrectly formatted values that introduce
    noise to ML. Directly feeding such data to ML models is inappropriate as they
    may fail to derive the right pattern. Poor data quality can thus lead to significantly
    unsatisfactory performance. Data should be machine-readable, trustworthy, and
    impartial. By ensuring data is correctly classified, data curation can assist
    ML model developers in validating the diversity of training data for irrigation
    modeling applications. Therefore, it is important to statistically analyze and
    understand the data and select suitable methods for removing noise and bias in
    the data. To counteract the substantial bias that data preprocessing methods may
    induce in predictions, it is recommended that maximum entropy constraint be applied
    on the inference step (Pfeiffer et al., 2015), forcing predictions to have a distribution
    similar to the one of observed values. Although data sparseness might persist
    and perhaps be exacerbated by big data, the volume of big data presents exceptional
    prospects for predictive analytics because sufficient frequency may have been
    achieved for diverse sub-samples. On-farm big data are in divergent formats, from
    distinct population samples, and so are very heterogeneous. It can be very tedious
    to transform heterogeneous data into a uniform format. In addition, these heterogeneous
    data may be of different levels of importance in the learning process (Zhou et
    al., 2017). Therefore, adding all the features and giving them equal weights in
    ML models is unlikely to lead to optimal learning results. 4.3. Lack of accessibility
    and reproducibility of data and machine learning models Irrigation data is part
    of large earth system datasets that are produced at the farm scale; however, the
    majority of this data is not openly shared and is unavailable. Other irrigation
    metadata are put into password-protected and key-value data structures that limit
    their findability and accessibility significantly. Open access to data should
    be improved to better serve irrigation scheduling applications (Gu et al., 2020).
    Open data advances research by preventing duplicate data collection efforts freeing
    up resources to gather a more distinct collection of data and a more comprehensive
    record of observations. Secondly, open data regulations promote increased data
    usage and reuse. For example, after enacting the Landsat open and free data policy,
    data downloads increased by 20 times from 2009 to 2017, and, according to the
    annual number of publications, data use increased by four times (Z. Zhu et al.,
    2019). Advancing research is not solely limited to making data readily available
    but also requires the availability of developed software. Providing open access
    to software’s source code allows computational and scientific transparency and
    reproducibility. Scientific reproducibility is evasive if free access to code
    is restricted. Gil et al. (2016) argued that simply providing textual explanations
    of algorithms and code implementation may hamper reproducibility. Moreover, open-source
    software favors software reuse which reduces duplication possibilities, promotes
    the use of open data, and guarantees the code’s lifespan (Committee on Best Practices
    for a Future Open Code Policy for NASA Space Science, 2018). A rising recognition
    of the necessity of making data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and
    reusable (FAIR; Wilkinson et al., 2016) has set a standard for expanding the availability
    of research standards and tools that ease data sharing and management (Wagner
    et al., 2022). FAIR principles imply that data and tools must be easily findable,
    freely obtainable, and reusable so that methodology and derived results can be
    entirely transparent (Koymans et al., 2020). Data and tools can be findable when
    they are sufficiently described by rich metadata and registered or indexed in
    a known and accessible searchable resource. Accessibility means that users and
    machines, following appropriate authorization and via a well-defined protocol,
    can obtain data and the related tools. For data and tools to be interoperable,
    they should be described using normative and community-known specifications. Reproducibility
    is another aspect of the FAIR principle that received less attention in the irrigation
    community. Reproducibility necessitates describing in detail the characteristics
    of the data and tools, and their origin according to community standards with
    clear and accessible conditions for usage (Boeckhout et al., 2018). At a minimum,
    ML modeling outcomes should be reproduced and ideally replicated by other users
    before it is deployed. Currently, farm-related data, including irrigation, soil
    moisture, and climate information, are not based on the FAIR principles, nor their
    metadata format and terminology are constrained by these guidelines. To move towards
    a FAIRer future that boosts the availability of farm-related data and tools, continuous
    generation of FAIR metadata standards and reproducible tools are indeed needed
    for future data-driven applications in irrigation modeling. Towards this end,
    scientific communities can adopt several best practices, namely making their data
    and ML algorithms accessible in a public cyberinfrastructure and in a non-proprietary
    standardized format, creating a digital object identifier for their data and tools,
    and providing clear licensing information along with constraints on the use. To
    encourage reusability, software and code should also be openly available through
    a non-restrictive license adopted by the community to facilitate reproducibility.
    4.4. Blackboxness of machine learning models The explainability and interpretability
    of ML models are another aspect of ML that has been questioned in the past (Kaur
    et al., 2020, Moraffah et al., 2020). Enhancing models’ predictability comes at
    the cost of increasing their complexity which often makes them less interpretable.
    However, the interpretability of ML models is more important than their accuracy
    (Rudin, 2019). For example, to trust the irrigation recommendations provided by
    a model, irrigation specialists and crop consultants would be more interested
    in knowing the accuracy of irrigation recommendations for a certain scheduling
    time than in the structure of the algorithms and the types of performance metrics
    used in the model. Explainable ML has initiated a set of methods to increase the
    interpretability and explainability of ML models (Carvalho et al., 2019, Miller,
    2019). In the agricultural domain, these techniques have been applied in several
    prediction tasks such as crop yield estimation (Sihi et al., 2022, Wolanin et
    al., 2020), prediction of daily pan evaporation and evapotranspiration (El Bilali
    et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023) and in monitoring fields’ conditions for optimizing
    crop production (Sabrina et al., 2022). To interpret the results of a model, the
    current ML approaches aim to evaluate the effects of various combinations of input
    variables on the results by applying techniques such as Shapely Additive exPlanations
    (SHAP) that can assess the pros and cons of an input feature on the model output.
    Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is another popular technique
    applied to make ML models’ results human interpretable by estimating the behaviour
    of a complex model, it consists of adding noise to a data point without changing
    the rest of the dataset, fitting the new dataset to the model, and observing the
    behaviour of the model (Ribeiro et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, these
    approaches have not yet been adopted in explaining irrigation predicting models;
    there is, therefore, room to improve the understanding of these models by incorporating
    such techniques into the current ML modelling structures. 4.5. Lack of human interaction
    with machine learing-based irrigation modeling Although considerable effort has
    been made to develop irrigation decision-making models, current models lack a
    way to integrate expert knowledge into the simulation process. The limited success
    of these models is partly because the decision rules used in the models are limited
    in scope than the factors growers use to make decisions (Car, 2018). Researchers
    mostly create models that can tackle agricultural problems without the need for
    human interaction. Unfortunately, a majority of existing models have not yet reached
    this degree of intelligence. Due to calculation time constraints and the complexity
    of agricultural problems, models may provide imprecise irrigation recommendations.
    As a result, agricultural knowledge from experienced irrigation specialists, Extension
    professionals, and experienced farmers can be employed in the model to improve
    the feasibility of ML outcomes and validate the results. An interactive interface
    that allows professionals to share their knowledge and perspectives can be an
    approach to considering expert judgment. Another way to allow human control over
    ML models is to develop systems that enable human-in-the-loop feedback and interactions.
    The effective application of ML models in irrigation scheduling systems requires
    that humans control their outcomes to minimize the risk of lethal results. Efficient
    human control is the capability to incorporate human knowledge into the modeling
    process to make informed, timely decisions that provide the greatest operational
    outcomes possible (Boardman and Butcher, 2019). ML systems must create models
    that take into consideration a range of contextual data in order to function well
    in complicated settings (National Academies of Sciences, 2021). This allows the
    systems to make decisions by accurately understanding the current situation and
    projecting future scenarios. However, human-in-the-loop techniques need to be
    developed to ease the collaboration between ML models and irrigation experts such
    as Extension irrigation specialists and experienced farmers. This will help align
    goals and synchronize task prioritization, resource allocations, and improved
    irrigation decisions. 4.6. Uncertainty and error in machine learning simulation
    Although ML techniques for irrigation decision-making were proven to be helpful
    in irrigation planning, all the reviewed papers did not take into consideration
    the errors and uncertainties in the predictions. Uncertainty in irrigation modeling
    stems from the continuously changing environment, such as meteorological conditions
    and soil moisture variations. The lack of uncertainty quantification in the ML
    predictions may result in overfitting or underfitting outcomes. Considering ML
    predictions without assessing the extent to which results are credible given the
    associated uncertainties in the input data and model often leads to inappropriate
    or biased decisions. For example, if the input data fed to a model trained to
    predict the irrigation amount lies outside the training data distribution, the
    model may generate unreasonable irrigation recommendations that are essentially
    based on an “educated guess”. But, if the prediction is accompanied by confidence
    intervals that is the certainty the model itself has of its prediction, the decision
    taker would be informed of this randomness and decide on the irrigation amount
    accordingly. Thus, an assessment of uncertainties in the simulated results is
    crucial to ensure that the results fall within a certain level of confidence.
    Generally, uncertainty can arise from input data and the ML procedures or structure
    in the modeling process. There are two types of uncertainties, (i) epistemic uncertainty
    resulting from the ML architecture choice and model parameters and (ii) aleatory
    uncertainty due to a physical system’s intrinsic randomness. Aleatoric uncertainty
    describes the inherent randomness of the data-generating process, which cannot
    be justified by gathering additional data samples or observations (Kendall and
    Gal, 2017). This form of uncertainty is caused by unknown processes that pertain
    to the concept of randomness, i.e., the unpredictability in modeling outcomes.
    Aleatoric uncertainty can further be subdivided into homoscedastic and heteroscedastic
    uncertainties. Homoscedastic uncertainty is independent of ML inputs, which means
    that it remains consistent regardless of input. Because this sort of uncertainty
    produces uniform variances for all inputs, the variation in observation noise
    for all input parameters is constant (Tabas and Samadi, 2022). On the other hand,
    heteroscedastic uncertainty varies with datasets, where some inputs provide more
    noisy outputs than others. Aleatoric uncertainty does not increase for out-of-distribution
    data contrary to epistemic uncertainty that can be handled in the modeling process
    if sufficient training data is available. Epistemic uncertainty may increase during
    the testing period for those data points that lie outside the training dataset.
    Thus, the larger the training dataset the lower the epistemic uncertainty. Modeling
    these two types of uncertainties increases the predictive performance of models.
    Understanding how individual sources of uncertainty propagate to the integrated
    irrigation system response is useful in analyzing the impact of data and model
    uncertainty on the simulated results. Additionally, distinguishing these uncertainties
    helps understand the sources of errors that have the potential to be reduced.
    Differentiating them also makes decision-making transparent and helps in making
    more informed (irrigation) decisions as unreduced uncertainties are clear and
    known (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen, 2009). Uncertainty estimation methods can
    be classified into four categories namely single deterministic methods, Bayesian
    approximations, ensemble learning, and test-time data augmentation methods. The
    most widely used methods are Bayesian approximations such as Monte Carlo dropout,
    Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) optimization methods (Duane et al., 1987), Bayesian
    Model Averaging (Samadi et al., 2020), and ensemble learning methods such as deep
    ensemble, Bayesian deep ensemble, and Dirichlet deep networks (Abdar et al., 2021).
    Largely, data uncertainty for a normally distributed uncertainty can be measured
    by predicting the parameters of a probability distribution for instance the mean
    and standard deviation (Kendall and Gal, 2017, Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017).
    These approaches can be coupled with ML-based irrigation water use modeling to
    reduce errors and uncertainty during both training and testing periods. However,
    to efficiently reduce uncertainty in ML modeling, rigorous tests of the suitability
    of different irrigation process parameterizations and model parameters are needed
    across different model development stages as well as various testbeds and farm
    settings. 5. Physics-guided machine learning (PGML) PGML offers a compelling solution
    to improve irrigation decisions and the interpretability of ML models. The interactions
    between plants, the soil, and the environment are complex and require a wide range
    of physical processes to be accurately programmed and described in space and time
    by a data-driven model. PGML provides an opportunity to leverage the best attributes
    of both data and physical processes in the ML models (Shen et al., 2018). Combining
    physical processes with data-driven capabilities can be performed in a variety
    of ways. Approaches to incorporate physical principles into ML models involve
    constructing new ML architectures that can employ some physical laws and processes
    in the irrigation water use prediction. These improvements are possible because
    ML models are modular and versatile. Scientific knowledge can be utilized to define
    node links that capture physics-based correlations among variables. Another method
    for infusing established physical properties into an ML architecture is to assign
    physical significance to some neurons in the network by incorporating physical
    intermediate variables into the network (see Fig. 6). Daw et al. (2020), for example,
    implemented these two approaches in LSTM for lake temperature modeling by introducing
    physics-informed connections among neurons in the network. Furthermore, they added
    physical significance to some of the network’s neurons by calculating physical
    intermediate elements along the network’s route hence creating a unique physics-guided
    LSTM structure. Another related method is to set some of the neurons’ weights
    to physically meaningful values or parameters and make them constant throughout
    the ML training process. Download : Download high-res image (103KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 6. Physics guided architecture of ML (adapted from
    Daw et al., 2020). Another point of view, however, tackles the challenge of embedding
    prior knowledge in an ML from a different perspective. Currently, rather than
    creating a specific model structure that indirectly imposes prior knowledge, endeavors
    are being made to enforce physics-constrained learning by encoding appropriate
    partial differential equations (PDE) into the loss function of ML approximations
    utilizing methods such as automated differentiation, (see for example Sirignano
    and Spiliopoulos, 2018; Raissi et al., 2019; Y. Zhu et al., 2019; Geneva and Zabaras,
    2020). This approach comprises a double learning process, where an algorithm learns
    to concurrently match the observed data and to produce outputs that approximately
    meet a specific set of physical laws such as energy and mass conservation. Constraining
    the optimization of data-driven models is a natural way to include domain knowledge
    in the process of learning, and by doing so physically implausible predictions
    can be avoided. For problems where linear equations can be used to describe physics-based
    constraints, integrating the latter in existing constrained optimization formulations
    is straightforward. However, many agricultural problems involve complex non-linear,
    and dynamic processes. For instance, simulating crop yield as a function of numerous
    inputs such as irrigation timing and amount, plant cultivar, and soil hydraulic
    properties have constraints that are expressed in complex formulations such as
    non-linear relationships between variables or PDE which are not effectively treated
    by conventional constrained optimization approaches. In this case, it is crucial
    to form constrained optimization methods that can use common PDE forms and can
    handle the non-linearity of physical variables. 6. Discussion This paper reviewed
    16 studies that were relevant to the application of ML in supporting irrigation
    decision-making. The goal was to identify ML algorithms commonly used to build
    systems supporting irrigation decision making, analyze developed systems based
    on these algorithms and discuss their performance and limitations as ways to improve
    irrigation water use management. We observed that the input data for soil and
    weather-related parameters used to train the developed models were obtained mainly
    from sensors distributed across the study areas. Therefore, wireless sensor networks
    and IoT technologies have played an important role in enabling the application
    of ML models in irrigation water use modeling. However, careful selection of input
    features is crucial to obtain a good model performance. While it is important
    to critically select the input data, it was demonstrated by Goldstein et al. (2018)
    and Jimenez et al. (2021), that having many input variables to predict irrigation
    demand does not imply having a better model. More than half of the reviewed papers
    used simple ML algorithms such as LR, RF, SVM, DT, etc. which sometimes do not
    accurately simulate the relationship between the plant and its environment, especially
    for high-dimensional datasets. As stated by Goldstein et al. (2018), Torres-Sanchez
    et al. (2020), and Sidhu et al. (2020), due to the non-linear relationships among
    soil, weather variables, and crop water requirement, linear regression models
    do not perform well because they cannot accurately learn the underlying functions
    and data patterns that relate the input to output process. Therefore, in crop
    water requirement prediction, the algorithms that can simulate the non-linearity
    between the inputs and outputs are recommended. Ensemble learning methods such
    as Adaboost and GBRT provide a way to improve the predictability of ML models
    and have demonstrated good performance in predicting irrigation management over
    algorithms such as LR. According to the results of Alibabaei et al. (2022), LSTM
    networks perform better than other algorithms because they can make use of the
    retained information from previous time steps in the following ones to provide
    better predictions. Hence, they have proven to be robust and able to accurately
    simulate the relationship between the dependent and independent variables when
    data sets from new sites are used. We postulate that PGML can be a better approach
    to modeling the interlinkage between the soil, plant, and climate variables. Moreover,
    these interactions vary extensively in time, distance, and region and physical
    attributes can better describe these variabilities; thereby incorporating physics
    into the ML algorithms can justify these interlinked processes and parameter choices
    for which reliable values can be obtained. On one hand, it was observed that ML
    approaches have shown the potential to support irrigation decision-making and
    reduce the time spent by agronomists on analyzing a large quantity of data to
    determine irrigation water requirements. On the other hand, ML models require
    a wide range of data in space and time which are often not readily available.
    To overcome this challenge, additional data sources were discussed and data augmentation
    methods such as GAN are proposed as approaches to generate new data. However,
    both data and model uncertainty should be addressed in data-driven crop water
    demand modeling. We observed that there is a lack of both aleatoric and epistemic
    uncertainties assessments in all the surveyed studies, yet these uncertainties
    affect considerably the simulation results and, subsequently. the reliability
    of the developed systems. Additionally, there is still a lack of incorporating
    agronomists’ knowledge in the irrigation decision-making process. To bridge this
    gap, human-in-the-loop approaches to enable interactions between farmers and ML
    models should be explored in the future. Lastly, to widen the adoption of the
    ML-based irrigation decision-making systems, we recommend the implementation of
    FAIR principles in irrigation modeling as has been the case for other disciplines
    such as ecological and environmental modeling (Petzold et al., 2019, Quay et al.,
    2021) and water science simulations (Crystal-Ornelas et al., 2022, Cannon et al.,
    2022). For ML-based irrigation decision-making models to have an impact on water
    sustainability and management, data and the resulting tools must be openly accessible,
    easily findable, and reusable. 7. Conclusions This review highlights the outcomes
    of ML based irrigation scheduling models applied in different geographical, farm
    and crop settings. We discussed the current state-of-the-art models and proposed
    several approaches that could complement data-driven irrigation modelling. To
    summarize, the reviewed studies provided promising outcomes for irrigation scheduling.
    As we make progress in data-driven simulation, we expect to gain a new understanding
    of the relative importance of the choice of different neural network architecture
    and their workflow and structure that drive decisions and actions. The review
    analyses presented herein are intended to provide a basis for data-driven irrigation
    scheduling applications across different environmental and geographical settings.
    Further research is, however, needed to ensure the effectiveness of developed
    ML models and their applicability in farms with different soil, weather, and crop
    characteristics. Recognizing a growing enthusiasm for data-driven modeling applications
    in irrigation scheduling, we anticipate growth on several facades: (i) a better
    ML model capable of forecasting irrigation water use in advance, (ii) a better
    benchmarking irrigation model to compare with the data-driven approaches, and
    (iii) a better pre-processing approach for data and error estimation methods and
    the ways to leverage human-in-the-loop in the ML modeling system. As always, we
    welcome discussions with irrigation research communities interested in data-driven
    and other related ML modeling development to address irrigation hydrology challenges.

    The global agricultural sector is a major user of freshwater, accounting for around
    70 % of the world''s consumptive use of freshwater resources. However, traditional
    agricultural irrigation methods face substantial challenges, including inefficiencies
    in water usage and suboptimal agricultural productivity. Additionally, the unpredictable
    impacts of climate change and global warming have disrupted rainfall patterns,
    affecting crop water needs, which vary based on seasonal and environmental factors
    such as weather conditions [1]. According to the findings of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), countries within the Mediterranean Basin are poised
    to experience more pronounced effects of climate change. These effects will manifest
    primarily as increasing temperatures, a reduction in the overall water balance,
    and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events [2]. Specifically,
    in the Mediterranean Basin, there are two major challenges: less rainfall and
    rising temperatures, especially during the summer period. These lead to water
    shortages in many areas, affecting rivers, lakes, and water reservoirs. Water
    shortages are a significant threat to food and energy security, especially for
    agriculture, resulting in lower crop yields and jeopardising sustainable development.
    Adding to these concerns, the world''s population is expected to reach 9.1 billion
    by 2050, increasing the demand for food and energy, and making the issues of water
    scarcity and rising temperatures in the Mediterranean Basin even more pressing
    [3]. Greece, a Mediterranean Basin country experiencing the impacts of climate
    change [4], is one of the largest producers olive and cotton in Europe. In the
    olive cultivation sector, Greece consistently maintains its position among the
    top three European countries, alongside Spain and Italy, accounting for approximately
    15 % of the total 4.6 million hectares of olive groves within the European Union
    in 2017 [5,6]. Moreover, cotton is primarily grown in the European Union on around
    320,000 ha, with Greece dominating the cotton area at 80 %, followed by Spain
    and Bulgaria [7,8]. Although cotton and olive trees possess impressive adaptability
    to diverse environmental conditions, they remain vulnerable to the impacts of
    climate change, particularly concerning their growth and need for irrigation [9,10].
    Olive trees thrive in regions with as little as 400 mm of annual precipitation—below
    the traditionally recommended 600 mm threshold [11]. Despite the inherent drought
    tolerance of olive trees, modern agriculture increasingly employs irrigation for
    olive cultivation to optimize yields and address the challenges posed by shifting
    climate patterns and the rising demand for olive-related products. As a result,
    implementing efficient irrigation management strategies and adopting precision
    irrigation technologies play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable and resource-efficient
    olive farming [9]. Cotton cultivation requires 600–1000 mm of precipitation during
    its entire growth phase, further highlighting the importance of water in its cultivation.
    The absence of sufficient water for cooling poses a significant threat to cotton
    plants due to excessive heat. Consequently, cotton''s growth and temperature management
    heavily rely on irrigation, whether from precipitation or irrigation. Precise
    timing and proper water application during the growing season become critical,
    as any disruptions in water availability can hinder plant development, potentially
    resulting in reduced yields. Notably, cotton farming significantly relies on irrigation,
    accounting for approximately 53 % of the world''s total irrigation, with irrigated
    fields producing 3000–4000 kg of seed cotton per hectare, compared to 1000–2000
    kg in non-irrigated fields. Consequently, over 73 % of the world''s cotton fibre
    originates from irrigated cultivation [10,12]. To address water scarcity and subsequent
    sustainability challenges, precision irrigation systems have emerged as a practical
    solution [13]. Precision irrigation, in the context of precision agriculture,
    is a technologically driven practice that involves the accurate and timely assessment
    of crops'' water requirements, followed by the precise delivery of the exact amount
    of water they need. This method incorporates information systems, communication
    networks, and real-time control mechanisms to monitor and respond to crops'' dynamic
    water needs, taking into account factors such as soil variations, plant responses,
    and changing weather conditions. The overarching goal of precision irrigation
    is twofold: firstly, to optimize water usage and enhance the efficiency of crop
    cultivation, and secondly, to alleviate the pressure on natural water resources
    [14,15]. Leveraging technologies like Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic
    Information Systems (GIS), in conjunction with computer modelling, remote sensing,
    and advanced information processing, enables the collection of comprehensive field
    data pertaining to spatial and temporal variations in crop production [16,17].
    Previous research has consistently shown that the adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies leads to elevated crop yields and enhances the efficiency of water,
    soil, nutrients, and other agricultural inputs [14]. For instance, a study implementing
    Variable Deficit Irrigation (VDI) in cotton production, integrating remote sensing,
    soil analyses, and crop growth modelling for irrigation management, reported a
    substantial increase of approximately 28.7 % in yield, accompanied by a 24.9 %
    reduction in water usage. This approach also demonstrated enhanced nitrogen and
    fertilizer productivity [18]. Similar positive outcomes have been observed in
    other studies related to cotton cultivation that utilized irrigation Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) [1,[19], [20], [21]] and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. These positive results extend to olive cultivation,
    where a study utilizing DSS-based irrigation management demonstrated its effectiveness
    as a sustainable and resource-efficient choice, resulting in a notable 42.1 %
    reduction in water and energy compared to conventional practices [28]. In another
    study focused on Scientific Irrigation Scheduling (SIS) in olive groves, soil
    moisture sensors coupled with a drip irrigation system resulted in water savings
    between 17 % and 25 %, along with yield enhancements of 8 % and 9 % [29]. Furthermore,
    studies have proven that employing remote monitoring and control systems [30,31],
    as well as a combination of remote and proximal sensing technologies, can improve
    water efficiency in olive cultivation [32]., Despite the evidence of the advantages
    of precision irrigation technologies, the adoption and widespread implementation
    of these technologies have been relatively slow, especially due to high initial
    investment costs and the lack of farmer skills required in the integration of
    the new technologies into current farming operations. Recent reviews of adoption
    studies in precision agriculture highlighted the lack of substantial research
    on the behavioural factors affecting farmer adoption of precision agriculture
    technologies [33,34]. Notably, the vast majority of studies has focused on farm
    and agro-ecological related factors, socio-demographics, and technology-related
    characteristics [35]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the factors
    influencing its adoption, a key step toward more effective implementation [36].
    A plethora of theories and models have emerged to shed light on the factors that
    affect behaviour and adoption of technologies, with the most prominent being the
    Rogers'' Theory of Diffusion of Innovation, Davis et al.''s Technology Acceptance
    model and Ajzen''s Theory of Planned Behaviour. Rogers'' Theory of Diffusion of
    Innovation (1983) serves as a foundational framework, providing a systematic roadmap
    for adoption. Within this theoretical framework, Rogers identified five essential
    attributes that profoundly influence the adoption rates of innovations: relative
    advantage, measuring an innovation''s superiority; compatibility, assessing alignment
    with pre-existing values and needs; complexity, assessing the perceived ease of
    use; trialability, indicating the potential for experimentation and testing; and
    observability, highlighting the visibility of tangible benefits associated with
    the innovation. Innovations scoring higher on these attributes tend to be adopted
    more swiftly [37,38]. Simultaneously, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), introduced
    by Davis et al. (1989), directs our attention to two key factors: perceived usefulness,
    which reflects the degree to which individuals believe that a particular system
    will enhance their job performance, and perceived ease of use, related to the
    perception of how effortless it will be to utilize the system. Both these beliefs
    are significantly influenced by the design characteristics of the technology.
    TAM has undergone continuous evolution, with researchers introducing new variables
    and complicated relationships into the model. As a result, it has become a widely
    cited framework for comprehending technology acceptance [39,40]. Ajzen''s Theory
    of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (1991) serves as a central framework, explaining how
    individuals arrive at decisions regarding the adoption of technologies such as
    Precision Agriculture. It places significant emphasis on the role of attitudes
    and intentions in shaping final decisions. Intentions and actual behaviour are
    determined by two additional factors, namely, subjective norms (a person''s perceptions
    about the community''s attitude to certain behaviour) and perceived behavioural
    control (a person''s perception of ease or difficulty in carrying out a behaviour).
    These theories provide a promising theoretical framework to examine the behavioural
    factors that influence adoption of precision irrigation technologies [34,41].
    Extant research with respect to the behavioural factors that foster or hinder
    adoption of precision irrigation technologies is scarce. Some studies have concentrated
    on investigating a range of factors that influence the adoption of smart farming
    technologies [42], [43], [44]. Partalidou et al. [43] identified the primary barriers
    to adoption as a lack of knowledge, lack of guidance or support systems for the
    effective utilization of technology, and high initial investment costs. Kernecker
    et al. [42] focused on various technology-related factors and highlighted the
    importance of perceived usefulness, compatibility, ease of use, and perceived
    benefits in driving adoption of precision agriculture technologies. Systemic factors
    also play a role with financial support, legal framework, extension and advisory
    services, and the availability of informational sources playing a crucial role
    in bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users [42,44]. However,
    there is a lack of empirical studies specifically investigating the context of
    precision irrigation technologies and the associated determinants of farmers’
    adoption. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature and aims to analyse
    the determinants of farmers’ adoption precision irrigation in olive and cotton
    farming in Greece by focusing on certain individual behavioural factors. 2. Theoretical
    model In this section, we present our theoretical framework for understanding
    the adoption of precision irrigation (Fig. 1). In this framework, we propose a
    series of hypothesis, labelled as H1, H2, and so forth, which guide our research.
    Each hypothesis addresses a particular research question, and we will explain
    each one further in the upcoming sections. Download : Download high-res image

    model for precision irrigation. 2.1. Perceived behavioural control In the context
    of socio-psychological factors, individuals'' intentions play a crucial role in
    predicting their actual engagement in specific behaviours. This principle holds
    true for farmers as well, where the belief that they possess the necessary skills
    and time required for technology adoption significantly influences their likelihood
    of adopting it [45]. Perceived behavioural control is a key factor of Ajzen''s
    Theory of Planned Behaviour and refers to an individual''s belief in their ability
    to perform a specific behaviour. This belief is shaped by their perception of
    various control factors that can either make the behaviour easier or more difficult
    to execute. These control factors encompass a range of aspects, such as one''s
    skills and abilities, the availability of time, money, and other resources, as
    well as the cooperation and support of others [46]. In the context of adopting
    new technologies, perceived behavioural control relates to farmers'' perceptions
    of the ease or difficulty associated with the adoption process. Previous studies
    found that farmers exhibited a higher willingness to embrace new agricultural
    techniques when they perceived that the learning requirements were manageable
    and substantial investments were not necessary [47], [48], [49], [50]. H1: Perceived
    behavioural control has positive correlation with adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies. 2.2. Environmental consciousness Another individual factor that
    may affect farmer adoption is environmental consciousness. The importance of examining
    environmental consciousness lies in its ability to predict subsequent environmental
    actions. Environmental attitudes, which are viewed as enduring beliefs shaping
    how individuals interact with the environment, are expected to guide individuals
    towards corresponding pro-environmental behaviours. Based on Schwartz''s theory,
    individuals are more likely to take action when they are aware of the positive
    consequences of their actions and feel a sense of responsibility for helping the
    environment [51]. Prior research has delved into the influence of environmental
    consciousness on the adoption of environmentally friendly agricultural practices,
    with findings indicating that cultivating a strong personal sense of responsibility
    for environmental issues, such as water pollution [52] along with maintaining
    a heightened awareness of environmental issues [53], acts as a substantial catalyst
    for embracing environmentally friendly agricultural practices. H2: Environmental
    consciousness has positive correlation with adoption of precision irrigation technologies.
    2.3. Perceived economic benefits Perceived economic benefits is expected to be
    a key influencing factor in the adoption of precision irrigation. Perceived economic
    benefits refer to the expected economic rewards that farmers anticipate reaping
    after investing in precision irrigation practices. These rewards may manifest
    as heightened productivity, increased profitability, and savings in labour. When
    farmers believe that adopting sustainable practices will bring them economic advantages,
    they are more inclined to embrace such practices [54]. Understanding the potential
    advantages of increased yields and cost savings increases confidence, thereby
    alleviating their uncertainties and fears associated with adopting agricultural
    technologies [55]. H3: Perceived economic benefits have positive correlation with
    adoption of precision irrigation technologies. 2.4. Perceived compatibility Perceived
    compatibility is a critical factor to investigate when examining the adoption
    of technology. This concept is closely tied to the widely recognized Technology
    Acceptance Model (TAM). Perceived compatibility, within the context of technology
    adoption, delves into the degree to which individuals perceive a new technology
    as aligning with their established values, past experiences, work routines, and
    personal preferences [56]. The influence of perceived compatibility on users is
    substantial. It significantly shapes their attitudes and intentions regarding
    the acceptance and utilization of technology. For example, a producer who is committed
    to traditional agricultural practices is unlikely to incorporate new technologies
    into their system because it is incompatible with the existing values and norms
    of its farming practices [34]. H4: Perceived compatibility has positive correlation
    with adoption of precision irrigation technologies. 2.5. Risk aversion Risk aversion
    has a substantial influence on the adoption of precision agricultural technologies,
    primarily due to the significant initial investment costs that heighten financial
    risk [57]. Risk aversion refers to the tendency to avoid risks and have low risk
    tolerance. Farmers are constantly faced with various risks which can be associated
    with productions risks (e.g., yield variability due to climate change or yield
    loss), policy risks (changes in legal framework, subsidies, etc.), market risks
    (e.g., changes in the prices of agricultural inputs, market demand) [58]. Studies
    have found that farmers who are unwilling to take risks tend to overestimate the
    costs associated with adopting a new technology and show lower intention to invest
    in sustainable agricultural practices [52,53]. H5: Risk aversion has negative
    correlation with adoption of precision irrigation technologies. 3. Materials and
    methods 3.1. Study area The research took place in two regions of Greece: Messenia
    with olive producers and Thessaly with cotton producers. Messenia is situated
    in the southwestern area of the Peloponnese Peninsula, with its regional capital
    being Kalamata. Messenia''s economic backbone centres on agriculture, particularly
    the cultivation of olive trees for olive oil and edible olives, establishing it
    as a major player in Europe''s olive oil industry. The predominant olive variety
    cultivated in this region is Kalamon. In 2016, agricultural land in the Messenia
    region comprised a significant 25 % (734.3 km2) of the total land area, with olive
    groves dominating, covering the 82 % (604.1 km2) of this agricultural expanse.
    Messenia experiences a temperate climate characterized by mild winters and hot
    summers. The mean annual temperature typically ranges from 13°C to 19°C. During
    winter, the lowlands and coastal regions maintain an average temperature between
    17°C and 21°C, thanks to warm and humid south winds. In Messenia, the annual precipitation
    averages between 800 and 1600 mm, varying with the region''s elevation. Winter
    in the area is marked by the passage of depressions forming over the Mediterranean
    Sea, while in summer, the region is influenced by heat waves from North Africa
    [59,60]. The second region, Thessaly, is located in central Greece. Thessaly is
    a major cotton-growing area cultivating approximately 100,000 ha of cotton on
    average, out of the 240,000 ha of the national cotton cultivation which constitutes
    80 % of the total European production [61,62]. The climate in the western and
    central regions of Thessaly is characterized by continental conditions, resulting
    in cold winters and hot summers with significant temperature fluctuations. Conversely,
    the coastal areas of Thessaly enjoy a more Mediterranean climate. During the summer
    months, Thessaly experiences hot and dry conditions, with July and August temperatures
    soaring to 40°C. On average, Thessaly receives approximately 700 mm of annual
    precipitation, but this varies significantly across the region. In the central
    plain, rainfall averages around 400 mm, while the western mountain peaks can receive
    over 1850 mm of rainfall. During the summer there is minimal rainfall [63]. 3.2.
    Survey design A survey was developed with the aim of examining the factors influencing
    the adoption of precision irrigation by olive growers in Messenia and cotton growers
    in Thessaly. The questionnaire initially asked participants about their knowledge
    with respect to precision irrigation technologies and subsequently provided a
    definition before eliciting participants’ responses about whether they have previously
    adopted such a technology. The questionnaire consisted of the following main sections:
    1) farmer demographics, 2) farm characteristics, 3) behavioural factors affecting
    adoption and 4) intention to adopt precision irrigation technologies. Independent
    variables included perceived behavioural control, environmental consciousness,
    perceived economic benefits, perceived compatibility, risk aversion while the
    dependent variable was the intention to adopt precision irrigation technologies.
    For each variable, respondents were required to indicate their level of agreement
    or disagreement with the corresponding statement using a 5-point Likert scale,
    where 1 signified \"strongly disagree\" and 5 represented \"strongly agree\".
    Scales were adopted from previous literature and adapted to the context of precision
    irrigation, where needed. Variables were measured using at least three item statements
    to ensure consistency and reliability of measurement. Positive- and negative-phrased
    statements were used, and negative statements were then recoded for statistical
    analysis. Finally, prior to the distribution of the questionnaire, it was piloted
    with 20 farmers from both Messenia and Thessaly and the wording was adjusted based
    on their feedback. Table 1 provides a list of items used to measure the study
    variables, along with their corresponding references and the Cronbach''s alpha
    values, which gauge the internal consistency of these items. As is evident from
    Table 1 in all cases Cronbach''s alpha exceeded 0.7, a minimum threshold indicating
    acceptable reliability. Table 1. Study variables, measurement items, references,
    and Cronbach''s alpha coefficients. Variables Items No. Sources Cronbach''s alpha

    Data collection Data collection lasted for three months in the period between
    July and September 2022. The questionnaire was administered face-to-face. The
    direct face-to-face interactions with the targeted producers allowed the research
    team to address any queries, provide additional context, and ensure a comprehensive
    understanding of the questionnaire. In collaboration with major farmer associations
    in Messenia and Thessaly, the snowballing technique was employed to facilitate
    farmer recruitment and data collection. A total number of 82 farmers was achieved,
    with 42 from Thessaly and 40 from Messenia, which has been regarded as representative
    due to the length of the questionnaire and its non-technical dimension of precision
    irrigation. 3.4. Data analysis The data collected were manually inputted into
    the Excel for further processing and analysis. The dataset was further imported
    to IBM SPSS Statistics 21 for the analysis. Initially, data were checked for missing
    values by examining frequencies to ensure there were no missing data. Subsequently,
    descriptive analysis was conducted to gain an understanding of the data properties,
    including standard deviation and mean for continuous variables, as well as frequency
    analysis for categorical variables. For variables measured on a Likert scale that
    consisted of three or more questions, a reliability analysis was performed using
    Cronbach''s alpha. As previously indicated, Cronbach''s alpha demonstrated reliability
    levels exceeding the acceptable threshold. Consequently, the questions were combined
    into a single variable which was calculated as the average of responses to each
    item statement. Afterwards, a correlation analysis was performed, specifically
    using Pearson''s correlation coefficient, to assess the degree and direction of
    relationships between various variables in our study. Subsequently, a multiple
    linear regression analysis was conducted in SPSS to examine the impact of independent
    variables on the dependent variable. Finally, the sample was divided into two
    groups: cotton farmers in Thessaly and olive farmers in Messenia. To assess differences
    between the two groups, independent samples t-tests were used for continuous variables,
    while Chi-square statistics were employed for comparisons of categorical variables.
    4. Results 4.1. Sociodemographic characteristics of producers and farm characteristics
    The total number of responses was 82. From the 82 surveyed farmers, 44 % indicated
    that they were familiar with precision irrigation technologies, whereas the remaining
    56 % reported not having knowledge of these technologies (Fig. 2). Furthermore,
    only 20 % of the respondents had previously employed precision irrigation technologies,
    while 80 % respondents had not yet incorporated them into their agricultural practices

    were observed in their knowledge of precision irrigation technologies (χ2(1) =
    0.410, p = 0.522 > 0.05) and their previous use of such technologies (χ2(1) =
    1.012, p = 0.314 > 0.05). Table 2 displays the sociodemographic characteristics
    of respondents. Most respondents in the study are males (90.2 %) aged between
    36 and 45 years old (24.4 %). A majority of them have completed high school education
    (42.7 %), while a significant number hold undergraduate degrees (40.2 %). More
    than half of farmers report annual incomes of 20,000 euros or lower (51.2 %).
    Income is primarily derived from agricultural activities, constituting more than
    75 % of their income sources (30.5 %). Additionally, farmers in the survey report
    having 1 to 10 years of farming experience (47.6 %) while a substantial portion
    of respondents indicate 11 to 20 years of farming experience (22.2 %). Lastly,
    the majority manages farms spanning from 8.1 to 18 ha in size (23.2 %) and 1.6
    to 3.5 ha (20.7 %). Table 2. Sociodemographic and farm characteristics (N = 82).

    the means and standard deviations of the study variables, each with a sample size
    (N) of 82. Participants exhibited a balanced perception of control over the use
    of precision irrigation technologies, a notably higher level of environmental
    consciousness, a relatively high level of positive views on the economic advantages
    associated with precision irrigation, a relatively high degree of compatibility
    between precision irrigation technologies and existing farming practices, a fair
    level of risk aversion, and a moderate level of intention to adopt. Table 3. Mean

    of precision irrigation in olive and cotton farming systems Pearson correlations
    have been conducted to examine associations between variables which are presented
    in Table 4. Intention to adopt variable is significantly and positively correlated
    with perceived economic benefits, environmental consciousness, perceived behavioural
    control, and compatibility, but not with risk aversion. Furthermore, most constructs
    of the model were significantly intercorrelated except for risk aversion which
    has weak and non-significant relationships with the other variables. To assess
    the potential issue of multicollinearity, we calculated Variance Inflation Factor
    (VIF) values for the independent variables. The analysis revealed that VIF values
    for most variables were close to 1, indicating that multicollinearity is not a
    substantial concern within the regression analysis (Table 4). Table 4. Pearson

    at p < 0.01. Multiple linear regression analysis was subsequently conducted to
    examine the effect of the five independent variables on the intention to adopt.
    Regarding model-fit statistics, the Adjusted R-squared value of 0.503 indicates
    that the independent variables collectively explain approximately 50.3 % of the
    variation observed in the dependent variable. Moreover, the F-statistic is 17.427,
    accompanied by a significance level (Sig. F) of 0.000, indicating high overall
    model significance. As can be seen in Table 5 among the five independent variables
    considered, four variables showed a significant relationship at a 5 % significance
    level while risk aversion was significant at the 10 % significance level. Remarkably,
    perceived behavioural control contributes positively with a coefficient of 0.263
    (p = 0.015 < 0.05), indicating that higher levels of perceived behavioural control
    are associated with increased probability of adoption precision irrigation technologies
    (H1). Environmental consciousness exhibits a strong positive relationship with
    a coefficient of 0.361 (p = 0.004 < 0.05), where individuals with higher levels
    of environmental consciousness are more likely to adopt precision irrigation (H2).
    Similarly, perceived economic benefits demonstrates a positive association with
    a coefficient of 0.393 (p = 0.007 < 0.05), indicating that heightened perceptions
    of economic benefits lead to higher intention to adopt (H3). Perceived compatibility
    also plays a role with a coefficient of 0.235 (p = 0.044 < 0.05), signifying that
    perceived compatibility contributes positively to adoption (H4). Lastly, risk
    aversion exhibits a negative effect on adoption, as indicated by its coefficient
    of −0.149 (p = 0.069 < 0.10) (H5). Hence, all the hypotheses were supported. However,
    it''s important to emphasize that this negative effect of risk aversion does not
    reach statistical significance at the conventional p-value threshold of 5 %. Instead,
    it falls just above this threshold, with a p-value of less than 7 %. Table 5.

    6, results in Messenia and Thessaly are presented. The means and standard deviations
    of each study variable for the two study groups, cotton farmers in Thessaly and
    olive farmers in Messenia, are presented, along with the results of the statistical
    test of significant differences between these two groups. On average, the intention
    to adopt was similar among cotton farmers in Thessaly and olive farmers in Messenia
    (t(80) = −0.920, p = 0.360 > 0.05). Similar results were found for perceived behavioural
    control (t(80) = −1.394, p = 0.167 > 0.05) and environmental consciousness (t(80)
    = 0.750, p = 0.455 > 0.05) where differences between olive and cotton farmers
    did not reach significance levels. However, a statistically significant stronger
    perception of the economic advantages associated with precision irrigation technologies
    was demonstrated by cotton farmers in Thessaly compared to olive farmers in Messenia
    (t(80) = −2.575, p = 0.012 < 0.05). In terms of perceived compatibility, no statistically
    significant differences were observed between the two groups (t(80) = 0.680, p
    = 0.499 > 0.05). Lastly, on average, cotton farmers in Thessaly exhibited a higher
    degree of risk aversion compared to olive farmers in Messenia. This difference
    was found to be statistically significant, but it''s worth noting that it falls
    just below the threshold of 10 % (t(80) = −1.888, p = 0.063 < 0.10). Table 6.

    practices is a multifaceted process influenced by a variety of factors. In this
    section, we discuss the results of our study, which aimed to find the intricate
    web of behavioural factors affecting the adoption of precision irrigation technologies
    among farmers in the regions of Messenia and Thessaly in Greece. We selected five
    key factors—perceived behavioural control, environmental consciousness, perceived
    economic benefits, perceived compatibility, risk aversion—to explore their impact
    on precision irrigation technology adoption. Behavioural factors have been systematically
    neglected in previous studies on the adoption of precision irrigation. These factors
    were chosen based on their theoretical relevance and empirical evidence from previous
    studies in the field of technology adoption. Findings from the questionnaire indicate
    that perceived behavioural control emerged as a robust predictor of farmers''
    propensity to embrace precision irrigation technologies. These findings align
    with the Theory of Planned Behaviour [69], which asserts that an individual''s
    perception of control over a specific behaviour substantially shapes their intentions
    and, consequently, their actual conduct. This underscores the idea that farmers’
    actions are profoundly affected by their self-assuredness in their capacity to
    execute a particular behaviour, with this perception playing a vital role in predicting
    and comprehending adoption of precision irrigation in their farming activities.
    The presence of facilitating conditions or situational constraints change farmers’
    perceptions with respect to the ease or difficulty of performing a given behaviour
    [70]. In essence, our study revealed that farmers who exhibited a stronger sense
    of control over the adoption of precision irrigation technologies were significantly
    more inclined to adopt them. This outcome harmonizes with previous research in
    the realm of agriculture [71,72], which emphasized the importance of perceived
    behavioural control in sustainable farming practices adoption. Regarding environmental
    consciousness our data revealed that individuals with higher levels of environmental
    consciousness were more inclined to embrace precision irrigation technologies.
    This inclination can be attributed to the profound sense of environmental responsibility
    that accompanies heightened awareness [65]. These farmers are probably more aware
    of the environmental challenges posed by traditional irrigation practices, climate
    change and recognize precision irrigation as a sustainable alternative. By significantly
    reducing water usage and minimizing the adverse environmental footprint of farming,
    precision irrigation aligns with their environmentally conscious values. This
    finding is in line with a growing body of literature [73,74] emphasizing the role
    of environmental considerations in influencing farmers'' adoption of environmentally
    friendly practices and technologies. This emphasizes the need for strategies that
    induce long-term changes in individual behaviour towards environmental issues
    [51]. Perceived economic benefits have proven to be a significant predictor for
    the adoption of precision irrigation technologies. Our study indicates that farmers
    are more inclined to transition from conventional irrigation practices when they
    perceive tangible economic advantages linked to precision irrigation, such as
    increased productivity and cost savings. This aligns with broader insights from
    the literature [43,75,76]. Farmers need to be confident that the long-term benefits
    outweigh the costs, helping to mitigate uncertainties and apprehensions associated
    with the adoption of agricultural technologies [35,77]. This effect may be more
    pronounced in the Greek context where the majority of agricultural holdings are
    characterized by their small size increasing the perceived risks associated with
    new practices. Perceived compatibility, in line with Technology Acceptance Model
    (TAM), stands out as a critical determinant in shaping farmers'' intentions to
    adopt precision irrigation technologies. Those farmers who perceive precision
    irrigation technologies as harmonious with their existing agricultural practices,
    farming operations and values exhibit a higher propensity for adoption [56]. This
    reflects the fundamental principle that people''s readiness to adopt an innovation
    depends on its alignment with their daily routines, goals, and values. Essentially,
    when farmers see precision irrigation technologies as a natural extension of their
    established routines, the perceived compatibility strongly influences their decision
    to adopt them [78]. These findings resonate with prior research [42,47,79,80]
    highlighting the critical role of perceived compatibility with current practices
    in shaping farmers’ technology adoption decisions. Furthermore, our study underscores
    the noteworthy, albeit marginally significant, impact of risk aversion on the
    adoption of precision irrigation technologies among farmers. This finding suggests
    that risk-averse farmers may be hesitant to adopt these technologies. This reluctance
    can be attributed to the inherent caution often exhibited by risk-averse individuals,
    who prioritize strategies geared toward minimizing financial risk in their agricultural
    operations. Precision irrigation systems necessitate an initial investment in
    specialized equipment and technology, which may be perceived as risky, especially
    when uncertainty covers technology performance and potential return on investment.
    Furthermore, risk-averse farmers may overestimate the probability of losses associated
    with new investments and may choose to maintain their current, familiar methods
    and technologies, avoiding risks associated with adopting new, unfamiliar technologies
    [81]. Hence, risk aversion can pose a significant barrier to adoption, even when
    precision irrigation holds the promise of long-term benefits. The finding that
    risk averse farmers are less likely to adopt precision irrigation technologies
    aligns with other studies [71,82]. In summary, our study underlines the important
    role of perceived behavioural control, environmental consciousness, perceived
    economic benefits, perceived compatibility, and risk aversion in the adoption
    of precision irrigation technologies. These findings highlight the significance
    of developing tailored educational and training programs aimed at farmers in these
    regions to build their capacities and increase their perceived behavioural control
    in integrating precision irrigation technologies into their olives and cotton
    farming activities. Furthermore, marketing campaigns and availability of information
    sources with respect to the impacts of climate change and the benefits of precision
    irrigation technologies could increase environmental awareness in the farming
    communities of these regions. CAP financial support schemes that support investment
    costs in new technologies as well as the development of both mandatory and voluntary
    schemes for the transition to more sustainable agricultural practices to tap the
    more risk averse/less environmentally conscious individuals versus more risk-seeking/more
    environmentally conscious ones are expected to foster adoption rates of precision
    irrigation technologies. The influence of risk aversion in adoption of new technologies
    underscores the pressing need for the development of innovative risk management
    tools specifically designed to mitigate uncertainty and alleviate concerns among
    risk-averse farmers. As precision irrigation continues to offer substantial advantages
    for both agriculture and the environment, our study emphasizes the importance
    of targeted interventions and support mechanisms to promote its adoption and foster
    more sustainable farming practices. While our study contributes valuable insights
    into the behavioural factors influencing the adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations that may impact
    the generalizability of our findings. One notable limitation is the potential
    bias introduced by selecting farmers through collaboration with major farmer associations,
    as these affiliated farmers may hold different attitudes and practices compared
    to their non-affiliated counterparts. Moreover, the relatively small sample size
    further emphasizes the need for caution in generalizing our results. To enhance
    the robustness of future research in this area, we recommend incorporating larger
    sample sizes. Additionally, gaining insights from farmers representative of the
    general farmer population and extending the geographical scope of the study would
    contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of precision irrigation adoption
    in the Greek agricultural context. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, this study explored
    the determinants of precision irrigation technology adoption among farmers in
    the Messenia and Thessaly regions of Greece focusing on olive and cotton growers
    respectively. Our study emphasizes the critical influence of environmental consciousness
    on farmers’ intention to adopt precision irrigation technologies. Additionally,
    perceived economic benefits, perceived behavioural control, and perceived compatibility
    play significant roles in driving this intention. While risk aversion has a smaller
    impact, it remains a noteworthy factor in our analysis. This study builds upon
    the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Technology Acceptance Model to investigate
    the impact of various behavioural factors in the adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies in Greece. The research addresses the significant gaps in the literature
    which has focused mainly on farm and agro-ecological related factors, socio-demographics,
    and technology-related characteristics, thus, neglecting the importance of farmer
    individual characteristics and behavioural factors. Findings from this study have
    important implications for strategy implementation and policy design. Future research
    may delve further into additional variables, providing a more comprehensive understanding
    of the intricate adoption process within precision agriculture in Greece and other
    European countries. Systemic factors, such as norms, information sources, extension
    and advisory services, legal framework, financial support are expected to significantly
    influence farmer adoption of precision irrigation technologies. Furthermore, additional
    methodologies could be employed to add more evidence on the farm decision making
    processes with respect to adoption of precision irrigation. Interviews could provide
    a more in-depth exploration of the process while experimental designs could establish
    causal relationships between behavioural factors and the intention to adopt. Informed

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market
    for smart agriculture in the next years. 1.4. Preceding affined review papers

    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much

    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling

    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.

    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely

    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

    imageryDeep learningSystematic literature review 1. Introduction With its first
    advent 13,000 years ago on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, agriculture
    and farming became a ubiquitous source of food production and job creation (Gray
    and Nuri, 2020). In this process, the agricultural segment not only feeds billions
    of people around the globe but also forms the backbone of the national economy,
    with a hefty GDP contribution for most countries (Abioye et al., 2020; Friha et
    al., 2021). However, with the rapid growth in the world’s population, which is
    expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050 (Syeed et al., 2020), agricultural processes
    are facing severe challenges. This is because arable land is gradually becoming
    limited owing to the increasing demand for food safety. This limitation has triggered
    a striking increase in water consumption and the use of synthetic fertilizers
    and pesticides to increase food production. This has intensified several challenges,
    including environmental protection, water preservation, and sustainability (Inoue,
    2020; Rejeb et al., 2022). This scarcity has led to the adoption of technology-intensive
    novel agricultural process management and environmental monitoring, namely smart
    farming (Gupta et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021; Rejeb et al., 2022), precision
    agriculture (Bhat et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2019; Rejeb et al., 2022), greenhouses
    (van Loon et al., 2019), and vertical agriculture (Goodman and Minner, 2019).
    Researchers and practitioners argue that this adoption will address the challenges
    of effective operations, real-time decision support, efficient production, and
    supply chain management of agricultural processes. Consequently, environmental
    damage can be minimized through optimal water distribution and natural disaster
    prediction and prevention (Chavas et al., 2010; Eskandari et al., 2020). Over
    the past decade, several prominent technologies, analytical models, and methods
    have been developed. These include Remote Sensing (Barrile et al., 2022; Shafi
    et al., 2020), Internet of Things (IoT) (Gill et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2020;
    Syeed et al., 2023a, Syeed et al., 2023b), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) (Chandra
    et al., 2022; Zheng and Yang, 2018), machine learning and deep learning methods
    (Attri et al., 2023; Parsaeian et al., 2020), big data (Gill et al., 2017), and
    blockchain (Pincheira et al., 2021). With the advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs), Remote Sensing technology is now considered a tool with a high potential
    to improve smart and precision agricultural processes (Rejeb et al., 2022; Tsouros
    et al., 2019). UAVs are remotely piloted aerial systems or drones rigged with
    sophisticated equipment (e.g., multispectral cameras, sensors, and communication
    devices with decision-making intelligence) to serve the purpose of data acquisition/perception,
    decision-making, and action performance (Eskandari et al., 2020). UAVs are technologically
    advanced, highly efficient, low-cost, and real-time action performing systems
    compared to their counterparts, such as satellites and manned airborne systems
    (Pádua et al., 2017). Recently, a wide range of studies have investigated the
    adoption of UAV-based remote-sensing technologies along with machine learning
    (ML) and statistical models for agricultural process management and global food
    productivity (Eskandari et al., 2020; Rejeb et al., 2022). The reported results
    suggest that this adoption could support precision agriculture through instantaneous
    crop monitoring, classification, and management to increase production with optional
    costs and environmental hazards. For example, crop growth monitoring (Enciso et
    al., 2019) , crop scouting (Théau et al., 2020), crop yield estimation (Hasan
    et al., 2019), precise agrochemical (e.g., pesticides and fertilizers) spraying
    (Bouguettaya et al., 2022), invasive plant fighting (Wu et al., 2021), crop surveying
    (Casella et al., 2018; Surekha et al., 2020), and water stress monitoring (Brewer
    et al., 2022; Mohite et al., 2022) can be effectively conducted with UAVs. As
    the non-orthogonal dependency of UAVs and agriculture has become a prevalent research
    direction, ample research results exist that are scattered and fragmented over
    diverse application domains and contexts (Eskandari et al., 2020; Khan et al.,
    2021; Rejeb et al., 2022). Considering their intellectual contributions, the knowledge
    on UAVs in agriculture must be systematically clustered. Additionally, as a constantly
    evolving field of research that explores the adoption of contemporary technologies,
    systematic reviews must be conducted to periodically summarize the extant literature
    and report research gaps (Rejeb et al., 2022). Therefore, in this study, an exhaustive
    systematic literature survey aka SLR (Kitchenham et al., 2010) was conducted to
    summarize and structure the existing body of knowledge in the concerned domain.
    The distinctive contributions of this review are as follows: draws a comprehensive
    architectural design for a UAV-based precision/smart agricultural process, discusses
    the associated technical feasibility, defines the correlation between UAV-based
    imagery modalities and their implications for agricultural applications, provides
    a detailed taxonomy of the agricultural imagery datasets and their assessment
    approach (e.g., ML and statistical) for agricultural decision-making and action
    performance, and finally, defines the geo-density distribution of UAV adoption
    for agricultural crop monitoring. Furthermore, the implications of the reported
    research results are documented to derive future research directions. This paper
    is organized as follows. In Section 2, the core contributions of this work, along
    with a comparative assessment against existing reviews, are detailed. In Section
    3, the manifestation of the SLR research method for this study is documented.
    The overarching process of deploying UAVs for precision or smart agriculture is
    summarized in Section 4. The exclusive findings and observations regarding the
    research questions are reported in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6.
    Finally, a critical discussion and paving the way for future work are presented
    in Section 5, followed by a validity discussion, and concluding remarks in Sections
    6 and 7, respectively. 2. Research rationale As a multidisciplinary and rapidly
    evolving technological field of research, UAV adoption in agriculture has recently
    become the central focus of the research community. As shown in Fig. 2b, sharp
    growth in research interest has been observed over the past 14 years. Consequently,
    several reviews offering exclusive summaries of the tacit knowledge of specific
    interests within a given domain have been reported. For example, in (Mogili and
    Deepak, 2018), a brief review of UAV adoption for crop monitoring and pesticide
    spraying in Indian agricultural processes and practices are reported. In this
    study, only the technical feasibility of the UAVs was assessed for specific agrarian
    tasks. (Inoue, 2020), precision agriculture from the perspective of satellite-
    and UAV-based technologies, such as the use of advanced high-resolution sensors
    and AI-based methods and algorithms. The effectiveness and challenges of these
    technologies are investigated using case studies. The applications of UAV thermal
    remote sensing in precision agriculture were thoroughly examined by (Messina and
    Modica, 2020), including monitoring plant water stress, detecting plant diseases,
    assessing crop yield estimation, and plant phenotyping. Agricultural applications
    such as crop scouting, prevention of yield losses, crop management planning, and
    plant phenotyping have been studied using UAV-based remote sensing information
    (Hunt Jr and Daughtry, 2018) and (Xie and Yang, 2020). In (Tsouros et al., 2019),
    a UAV as a component of an IoT framework for precision agriculture is observed.
    In this review, several aspects of UAVs are investigated, such as agricultural
    applications of UAVs along with their technical viability, data acquisition, processing
    methods, types of crops, and geo-distribution for UAV adoption. Finally, the limiting
    factors of UAVs for precision agriculture are documented. A similar study (Aslan
    et al., 2022) assessed UAV applications for indoor and outdoor precision agriculture
    and highlighted the importance of the simultaneous localization and mapping of
    UAV in greenhouses. However, none of these studies adopted the Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR) process (Kitchenham et al., 2010) as their review methodology. Therefore,
    it is not possible to justify the completeness of the reviewed articles, the associated
    data collection and synthesis processes, or reviewer bias mitigation (Kitchenham
    and Charters, 2007; Petticrew and Roberts, 2008). The earliest comprehensive literature
    review on the adoption of UAVs in agriculture was conducted by (Eskandari et al.,
    2020). This study categorically reports a framework for UAV-based smart agricultural
    processes, defines the feasibility of UAV-associated technologies in agriculture,
    and summarizes the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) and statistical methods
    for UAV imagery analysis and decision-making. Another study on the track (Rejeb
    et al., 2022) conducted an in-depth review of deep learning methods (e.g., CNN-based
    image analysis) to assess UAV-driven remote sensing image analysis for crop classification.
    This study also draws a comparative assessment between pixel- and object-based
    classifications and reports the impact of a comprehensive UAV imagery dataset
    on enhancing crop classification accuracy. Finally, in (Bouguettaya et al., 2022),
    a review is conducted through bibliometric analysis (e.g., citation and co-citation
    analyses) to identify eight prominent research clusters and provide the critical
    anatomy of research works within these clusters. Similar results were reported
    by (Adão et al., 2017). Although these reviews portray intrinsic insights, all
    of them are vertical in nature, thus offering fragmented knowledge on specific
    aspects. Therefore, they fall short of drawing a holistic overview with a critical
    assessment of the constituent components for an in-depth understanding of UAV
    adoption for precision agriculture and management. Moreover, many of these studies
    lack compliance with biblical review methods (Kitchenham et al., 2010), which
    may raise further concerns. To address this vacuum, this study leverages the bibliographic
    literature review method (Kitchenham et al., 2010; Syeed et al., 2013) for a rigorous
    quantitative and qualitative analysis of contemporary research literature on UAV-assisted
    agricultural process management. The distinctive contributions of this review
    to the concerned domain of knowledge can be summarized as follows: (a) draw a
    holistic working principle for a UAV-based precision/smart agricultural process,
    (b) define the feasibility of UAVs for agricultural automation in relation to
    contemporary remote sensing technologies, (c) build the correlation between imagery
    modalities and their implications for agricultural applications, (d) define the
    taxonomy of agricultural imagery data sets and their assessment approach (e.g.,
    ML and statistical) for decision making and action performance, (e) assess the
    technical configurations of the UAVs with respect to (c) and (d) to better support
    the agricultural needs, and finally, (f) define the geo-density distribution of
    UAV adoption for agricultural crop monitoring. In addition, the implications of
    the reported results are analyzed to forecast future research directions. The
    comprehensiveness of this review in relation to contemporary reviews (detailed
    above) is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Reflection of contributions in relation

    Methodology The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method is an evidence-based
    research approach (Kitchenham et al., 2010) that relies on the aggregation of
    the best instances of prior research to identify, evaluate, and interpret all
    available research relevant to a particular topic or phenomenon of interest (Keele
    et al., 2007; Kitchenham, 2004; Kitchenham et al., 2010; Kitchenham and Charters,
    2007). Conducting an SLR involves several discrete activities and guidelines,
    as developed by Kitchenham and Charters. This review implements the same in an
    orderly manner for a thorough, impartial, and fair synthesis of the existing research
    in the concerned domain (Kitchenham, 2004;Kitchenham et al., 2010 ; Syeed et al.,
    2013), and performs a meta-analysis to detect real causes and effects in the research
    to draw valid conclusions (Kitchenham and Charters, 2007; Petticrew and Roberts,
    2008). The flowchart diagram shown in Fig. 1 demonstrates the flow of this review
    process, adhering to the bibliographic SLR guidelines offered in (Kitchenham and
    Charters, 2007; Syeed et al., 2012), the detail of which is presented in the subsequent
    sections. Download : Download high-res image (306KB) Download : Download full-size

    objectives and research questions The core objective of this review is to conduct
    a meta-analysis of contemporary research concerning UAV adoption for visual imagery-based
    applications in agriculture. Addressing this overarching objective requires drafting
    a clear and concise set of research questions (RQs) for a fine-grained assessment
    of review articles. Table 2 defines the research questions and their contributions
    towards the objectives. Table 2. Study research questions and objectives. Research

    in research with respect to their geo-distribution? Section 4.6 [RQ8.] What research
    significance and pragmatic implications can be deduced from the reported research?
    Section 5 To establish the implications of the reported results for the advancement
    of precision agriculture using UAVs and document the prudent research directions.
    3.2. Article selection and quality assessment The aim of the article selection
    process is to execute a rigorous, unbiased search strategy to accrue as many primary
    studies (i.e., research articles) relating to the research questions as possible
    (Kitchenham et al., 2010; Syeed et al., 2023a, Syeed et al., 2023b). These primary
    studies provide direct evidence for the research questions (Kitchenham et al.,
    2010). Therefore, following the guidelines of (Kitchenham et al., 2010; Syeed
    et al., 2013), this study executes the following article selection process: (a)
    list the most relevant digital libraries to be searched and the set of keywords
    to formulate the search strings; (b) state the explicit inclusion criteria to
    ensure the relevance and quality of the searched articles; (c) define a manual
    assessment process to verify the appropriateness of the selected articles against
    the inclusion criteria; and finally, (d) carry out a non-recursive search in the
    references of each shortlisted article for the inclusion of missing ones. 3.2.1.
    Listing the digital libraries The selection of digital libraries is underpinned
    by their reputation, the rigor of the scientific content they publish, and their
    relevance to the research (Kitchenham and Charters, 2007). For this study, five
    digital libraries and one search engine were selected (Table 3). To increase the
    likelihood of shortlisting the most relevant articles, the advanced search option
    of digital libraries was chosen, and the search was confined to the titles, keywords,

    3.2.2. Keywords and search strings For searching the digital libraires, search
    terms must be defined (Beecham et al., 2008; Kitchenham, 2004). Therefore, this
    study defined search terms (i.e., a list of keywords) pertaining to the research
    questions. When searching for a digital library, these keywords were combined
    to form a search string by consulting the guidelines of that specific library.
    For reference, the keywords and generic search strings are listed in Table 4.
    3.2.3. Inclusion criteria Articles listed through automated keyword searches often
    contain irrelevant articles, mostly because of an inappropriate list of keywords
    for classifying articles and poorly written abstracts (Cornelissen et al., 2009;
    Kitchenham, 2004). Therefore, explicit inclusion criteria should be defined to
    manually assess the quality and relevance of the articles to be included in the
    review (Cornelissen et al., 2009). Table 5 provides a detailed documentation of
    the criteria set for article inclusion in this study. Table 5. Article inclusion
    criteria. Selection Category Definition Subject Domain The main subject focus
    includes the unmanned aerial vehicle captured images/ videos. Exhaustively, any
    pre-processing, methodology, parameters, monitoring, and real-time applications
    on UAV leveraged imagery are the main study subject. Research Area The imagery
    should only span in the field of agriculture. Agricultural crop related tasks
    are the main interest of this review. Therefore, a paper with the outcome on the
    agricultural field is included in this scope. Forums Articles published in referred
    journals and conferences are included for the review. Like most SLRs, books are
    not considered for review. Also, a paper which has multiple focuses or for survey
    purpose is not included in the review. Ranking / Quality For the Journal Q1, Q2,
    Q3 or Q4. For Conference CORE A, CORE B and CORE C. Indexing Articles should be
    indexed at least in the Web of Science (WoS) and/or SCOPUS. 3.2.4. Manual selection
    The suitability of the articles was evaluated against the inclusion criteria (as
    defined in Table 5) through a manual assessment of the titles, keywords, and abstracts
    for each article listed in the automated keyword search (Kitchenham et al., 2010;
    Petticrew and Roberts, 2008). In cases of doubt, the conclusions were checked
    (Cornelissen et al., 2009). However, as identified by (Robinson et al., 2021),
    this selection process is prone to reviewer bias, and therefore requires impartial
    assessment by a domain expert external to the review team. Therefore, a professor
    in the concerned domain, who is external to the review team, was approached, given
    the set of selected articles and selection criteria for his expert review (Cornelissen
    et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2021; Syeed et al., 2012). Any disagreements were
    resolved through discussion. 3.2.5. Reference checking and final selection The
    abovementioned article section process might fail to identify relevant articles
    owing to inherent shortcomings. Therefore, following the recommendation (Cornelissen
    et al., 2009), we performed a non-recursive search through the references of manually
    selected articles. The exhaustive article search process resulted in 214 articles,
    including 138 journal articles and 76 conference papers. The overall process and
    statistical breakdown of the number of papers are presented in Table 6. A complete
    list of selected articles is presented in Table 11 (Appendix). Table 6. Statistics

    The process of data extraction and synthesis included quantitative and qualitative
    meta-analyses of the articles to provide a set of possible answers to the research
    questions. Each article is thoroughly studied and interpreted to extract the most
    appropriate results and discussions relevant to the research questions and are
    documented for further analysis and interpretation. Two independent teams were
    formed from the authors’ list to execute this step. In the first pass, the first
    four authors performed the data extraction, documentation, and preliminary synthesis.
    In the second pass, three other authors independently verified the documentation
    against the reviewed articles to ensure originality and completeness. This two-phase
    process often ensures the quality of reporting and reduces potential reviewer
    bias (Kitchenham et al., 2010; Kitchenham and Charters, 2007; Syeed et al., 2013).
    3.4. Demography of the collected articles The demography of the collected articles
    was carried out in two axes, namely (a) through the major primary publication
    channels (Fig. 2a) and (b), in accordance with the intensity of research progress
    over time (Fig. 2b). Several prominent publication channels (i.e., digital libraries)
    publish articles in the concerned domain, with IEEE, MDPI, and Elsevier being
    the front-runners. Fig. 2a summarizes the number of primary articles on the Y-axis
    against the publication channels and type of publication (e.g., journal and conference)
    on the X-axis. Of the 214 articles, 138 (65%) were identified as journals, and
    the remaining 76 (35%) were published in designated conferences. The proportion
    of journal and conference articles designates the balance between in-depth empirical
    investigative research and pragmatically situated problem-solving investigations
    in the concerned research domain. The selected articles were published over 14
    years between 2009 and March 2023. Fig. 2b presents a trend chart revealing the
    frequency of publications every two years, starting in 2009. The number of publications
    gradually increased over the years, with a rapid increase since 2016. Consequently,
    the curve fitting of this trend explains the growing research interest in this
    domain. Download : Download high-res image (240KB) Download : Download full-size

    The overarching process of deploying UAVs for precision or smart agriculture comprises
    three fundamental procedures: data acquisition, perception, decision-making, and
    action performance/application (Bouguettaya et al., 2022). The decision-making
    procedure, in turn, consists of three sub-processes to be accomplished in sequence:
    data and imagery preprocessing, training/learning, and accuracy measurement. A
    summary of this procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res
    image (713KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Adoption of UAV and
    associated technologies in agriculture. The data acquisition procedure begins
    with an understanding of the weather conditions, selection of the area for data
    acquisition, and understanding of the regulatory compliance for UAV operation.
    Thereafter, flight and camera configurations must be set based on the intended
    data collection. The collected data (e.g., imagery of the surveyed agricultural
    land area) were then preprocessed to enhance their characteristics for efficient
    training of the ML and statistical models. Geometric and radiometric calibrations
    are primarily conducted for color adjustment, noise reduction, distortion elimination,
    and blur removal (Aasen et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2018). The processed imagery
    is then used for the training and accuracy enhancement process of the ML and statistical
    models, the categorical list of which is presented in Fig. 3. Prediction models
    are mostly developed for precision agriculture (e.g., classification and regression),
    crop mapping (Hunt Jr et al., 2010), crop yield estimation, and wetland classification
    (Mahdianpari et al., 2017). Several classification methods, e.g., SVM, CART, DT,
    RF, A-NN, and regression models, e.g., SVR, RF are utilized for this purpose (Belgiu
    and Drăguţ, 2016; Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2015; Jaakkola et al., 2017). In addition,
    model accuracy measurement approaches were used, as listed in Fig. 3. Finally,
    based on the assessment results of the models, necessary actions were taken. This
    includes, for example, real-time monitoring and displacement of pesticides or
    fertilizers (Chen et al., 2021; Tendolkar et al., 2021), or timely planning for
    the Govt. authorities, and farmers. 4.1. On the comparison between UAV and contemporary
    remote sensing technologies Remote Sensing is the process of accruing physical
    information about an object without touch or contact (Campbell and Wynne, 2011).
    The adoption of remote sensing technologies for precision agriculture involves
    observing crops or farmlands from distances ranging from a few meters to hundreds
    of kilometers (Bouguettaya et al., 2022). For instance, unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), satellites, manned aircraft, and ground vehicles (Manned or Unmanned)
    are the most reliable remote sensing technologies that provide enhanced support
    in several agricultural segments compared to human-intensive manual processes
    (Bouguettaya et al., 2022). These include crop scouting (Théau et al., 2020),
    crop yield estimation (Hasan et al., 2019), precise agrochemical (e.g., pesticides
    and fertilizers) spraying (Bouguettaya et al., 2022), and invasive plant fighting
    (Wu et al., 2021). Table 7 presents a comparative summary of these remote-sensing
    technologies in relation to their advantages and disadvantages for precision agriculture.

    agriculture is the spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of the captured
    imagery (Bouguettaya et al., 2022). In digital imagery, spatial resolution refers
    to the number of pixels utilized in the construction of an image. With a higher
    spatial resolution, images have a greater number of pixels and thus have detailed
    information about the subject (Kitchin and Thrift, 2009). Ground Sampling Distance
    (GSD) is highly associated with spatial resolution. The GSD is the distance measured
    on the ground between two consecutive pixel centers and is used as a standardized
    metric to define the spatial resolution of remotely sensed images on the ground
    (Hung et al., 2014). The greater the image GSD value, the lower the spatial resolution,
    and the less visible the details. In contrast, temporal resolution defines the
    frequency (or time interval) at which a given geographical site is sensed (Shekhar
    and Xiong, 2007). This is often termed the revisit time or repeat cycle, after
    which data are acquired from the same location (Shekhar and Xiong, 2007). A higher
    temporal resolution is valued in precision agriculture applications. Spectral
    resolution signifies the sampling rate and bandwidth at which an imagery sensor
    collects information about the scene or geolocation (Kotawadekar, 2021). A higher
    spectral resolution often makes it easier to distinguish between two objects,
    which are characterized by a narrow bandwidth. The narrower the bandwidth of a
    particular channel or band, the finer the spectral resolution. The radiometric
    resolution explains the actual information content of an image. This represents
    the amount of information captured by each pixel. The radiometric resolution is
    determined each time an image is captured on film or by a sensor, by assessing
    the sensitivity to the magnitude of the electromagnetic energy. The radiometric
    resolution of an imaging system reflects its ability to distinguish small energy
    variations. The finer the radiometric resolution of a sensor, the more sensitive
    it is to variations in the reflected or emitted energy. In general, high spatial,
    temporal, and spectral image resolutions are required to identify crops or plant
    types, particularly in mixed-planting agricultural fields. Additionally, large
    agricultural fields must be covered within a reasonable period. Recent technological
    advancements have made UAVs highly capable of acquiring images with high spatial,
    temporal, and spectral resolutions, using a variety of multi-sensor cameras with
    RGB, Multispectral, and Hyperspectral sensors (Jintasuttisak et al., 2022; Osco
    et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2022). Additionally, low-altitude maneuvers and arduous
    area accessibility with precise geo-positioning, low cost of procurement and maintenance,
    and less prone to bad weather make UAVs the dominant technology for precision
    agriculture at present. Furthermore, the three basic tasks for precision agriculture
    (as detailed in Fig. 3) can be performed using UAVs. In the agricultural fields,
    UAVs can acquire designated information using sophisticated camera sensors and
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) modules. Intelligence for decision-making
    can be developed by implementing machine-learning-based algorithms to accomplish
    certain objectives and take necessary actions (e.g., invasive plant fighting and
    pesticide spraying). UAV flight missions can be operated in two configurations,
    either by the autopilot, which covers a predefined flight path, or by a ground
    flight operator using a remote controller. However, the UAVs used in agricultural
    management often have limitations. This includes medium-to-low area coverage,
    payload limitations, aviation regulations, and expert ground operator involvement.
    In contrast, other available remote-sensing technologies (e.g., Satellites, Manned
    aircraft, and Ground Vehicle) suffer from inherent shortcomings to fully comply
    with the requirements for precision agriculture. For instance, satellite images
    often suffer from very low spatial and temporal resolutions owing to sensor types,
    long distances, long visit times, and weather conditions (Bouguettaya et al.,
    2022; Hall et al., 2018). However, recent satellite platforms such as PlanetScope
    and WorldView Legion allow relatively high temporal resolution with multiple daily
    revisits to the same geographical location. In addition, Ground Vehicles often
    destroy plants and damage fields through soil compaction while maneuvering to
    capture images. 4.2. On the UAV based imaging modality Imaging modalities are
    often categorized by the method in which images are generated (Jacques and Christe,
    2020), and in the case of UAV imagery for agricultural applications, images and
    videos are acquired in three main modalities: visible spectrum, multispectral,
    and hyperspectral. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of these modalities in the electromagnetic
    spectrum. Ideally, the visible light spectrum is the electromagnetic spectrum
    that the human eye can view (e.g., Red, Green, Blue or RGB), whereas multispectral
    and hyperspectral spectra consist of multiple other bands along with RGB. For
    instance, the multispectral spectrum consists of three to ten bands, with each
    band having a descriptive title, namely the Red Edge (705–783 nm), Near-Infrared
    or NIR (750 nm -14000 nm), and Thermal Infrared (750 nm - 15000 nm). The red-edge
    region includes three bands centered at 705, 740, and 783 nm. The hyperspectral
    spectrum may consist of hundreds of narrower bands (10-20 nm) without descriptive
    names. Download : Download high-res image (285KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Electromagnetic spectrum of RGB, multispectral and hyper-spectral
    imagery. (Singh et al., 2020). Each of these modalities often captures images
    at different bands and spectra, capturing the distinct features of the subject
    and supporting diverse unfolding characteristics (Thomas et al., 2008). In general,
    imaging modalities are considered complementary rather than competitive, because
    they provide valuable information about the subject, which can be combined to
    derive meaningful conclusions. Table 8 summarizes the imagery modalities used
    to capture agricultural images in the reviewed articles. According to this table,
    106 research articles used the visible spectrum (RGB). 85 articles adopted different
    combinations of multispectral bands, of which 28 articles utilized a combination
    of RGB and NIR bands, and 26 articles used RGB, Red Edge and NIR bands. However,
    only 10 articles applied the hyperspectral spectrum within the band range of 400–1000
    nm, with 16, 33, 125, 150, or 270 bands. In the following discussion, these modalities
    are characterized with respect to their implications in agricultural management.
    Table 8. Imaging modalities explored in related research. 4.2.1. Visible spectrum
    The visible spectrum mainly consists of three light beams, namely Red (R), Green
    (G), and blue (B) or RGB, which must be superimposed at an arbitrary intensity
    in the mixture (from fully off to fully on) (Fonseca et al., 2011). The possible
    combinations of wavelengths were 630, 532, and 465 nm for red, green, and blue
    light, respectively. All features and colors observed by the human eye are within
    this visible spectrum. The color filter array acts as the main camera sensor for
    capturing RGB images. Studies like (Kattenborn et al., 2019) demonstrated that
    close-range high-spatial-resolution RGB imagery can lead to superior performance
    of the CNN-based approach in accurately mapping plant species and vegetation communities.
    Additionally, RGB information is visually cognizant of humans, and thus enables
    us to differentiate the target classes perceptibly. Furthermore, the data collection
    for RGB images are relatively inexpensive and easy to operate, and the collected
    data do not require sophisticated preprocessing. Therefore, high-resolution spectral
    information must be eliminated to accurately identify vegetation species or communities
    (Kattenborn et al., 2019). The vegetative properties of high-spectral RGB images
    were explored by (Sa et al., 2018c), who claimed that they could be comparable
    to the NIR band in relation to elevating the detection performance of DL for banana
    plants. In (Neupane et al., 2019), the chlorophyll content in leaves of canopies
    is calculated using the triangular greenness index (TGI) that is based on the
    area of a triangle surrounding the spectral features of chlorophyll with points
    at (670 nm, R670), (550 nm, R550), and (480 nm, R480), where Rλ is the spectral
    reflectance at wavelengths of 670, 550 and 480, respectively. Alongside, the NGRDI
    (Normalized green-red difference index) is also calculated to measure the vegetation
    indices based on the following equation that utilizes the visible bands only.
    (1) In this equation, GREEN represents the Green reflectance values and RED represents
    the Red reflectance values. The NGRDI ranges from -1 to 1, where values close
    to 1 indicate high levels of vegetation and values close to -1 indicate low vegetation
    or non-vegetated areas. Furthermore, in (Lottes et al., 2017) and (Bassine et
    al., 2018), the Excess Green Index (ExG) is calculated (using the following equation)
    to derive vegetation indices from RGB images. However, in the case of excessive
    green objects in the image background, this approach can lead to misleading segmentation.
    (2) Several other indices based on the visible spectrum have been applied to analyze
    plant health and photosynthetic activity and to detect environmental objects to
    determine agricultural areas (Song and Park, 2020), such as the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and soil adjustment
    vegetation index (SAVI) (Lu et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2018). Like NGRDI, values
    of these three indices vary between −1.0 and 1.0 and can be used to calculate
    the greenness of agricultural areas. For instance, in NDVI indices, a value close
    to 1 indicates high vegetation, a value greater than 0.2 indicates sparse vegetation,
    and a value less than 0 indicates no vegetation (Andritoiu et al., 2018). However,
    the disadvantage of using a high spatial resolution is the decrease in area coverage,
    which can constrain the overall efficiency of remote sensing applications (Zhong
    et al., 2020). 4.2.2. Multispectral The multispectral spectrum captures data along
    wavebands 3–10 of the electromagnetic spectrum. Generally, it captures all three
    primary colors (i.e., RGB) and a few blocks in the infrared region (e.g., Red
    Edge, NIR, MIR, Thermal), as shown in Fig. 4. Multispectral images are captured
    using multispectral cameras equipped with parallel sensor arrays that detect radiation
    at several broad wavebands and wavelengths to collect data for a given object
    (Andritoiu et al., 2018). In addition to RGB, the remaining wavebands are invisible
    to the human eye. The produced image should have as many feature layers as the
    number of wavebands included in the camera (Jónsson, 2019). Therefore, each pixel
    in each layer represents the reflectance of a specific band. To classify an image
    based on a specific feature, the band(s) that best distinguish the information
    for that feature can be used for classification (Shafi et al., 2020). For instance,
    Near Infrared (NIR) band can be used to distinguish vegetation layers from artificial
    surfaces because NIR has a higher reflectance for vegetation but a lower reflectance
    for artificial surfaces. 4.2.2.1. Red edge A red-edge band is sensitive to crops
    and is useful for crop classification. The red-edge region at 705–783 nm contains
    three bands centered at 705, 740, and 783 nm, as can be seen from Fig. 4. In this
    band, the spectral reflectance of green vegetation changes rapidly. This band
    is often used to estimate the vegetation Leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll concentration
    (Singh et al., 2021), crop growth, and stress state (Sun et al., 2022). For example,
    (Song and Park, 2020) reported that the red-edge band had a higher reflectance
    for floating plants, whereas waterside plants had the highest reflectance in the
    NIR region. Ideally, the red edge can be measured using the NDREI (Normalized
    Difference Red Edge Index) as follows: (3) The NDREI ranges from -1 to 1, where
    values close to 1 indicate high levels of vegetation and values close to -1 indicate
    low vegetation or non-vegetated areas. 4.2.2.2. NIR NIR occupies a wavelength
    of 750–1400 nm in the electromagnetic spectrum and is a more non destructive,
    non invasive, and highly efficient way to localize certain characteristics/details
    than what is achievable with the visible spectrum (Lan et al., 2020). NIR often
    produces Grayscale images (black and white); however, trees and plants, which
    are highly reflective in the NIR wavelength, appear much brighter in Grayscale
    than they do in color. Therefore, for plant heath monitoring NIR proves to be
    highly effective (Andritoiu et al., 2018). Healthy plants often reflect visible
    green light in the NIR spectrum while absorbing bright blue and red light. Conversely,
    reflection in the NIR spectrum was significantly reduced in ill plants. However,
    in both cases, red light is absorbed. Mathematical models based on wavelength
    absorption and reflection by green plants have been proposed to calculate vegetation
    indices and measure plant health. One such graphical indicator is the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is derived based on NIR and Red wavebands
    to assess whether the observed target contains vegetation. For instance, it can
    be used to calculate the index of leaf area, concentration of chlorophyll in leaves,
    plant productivity, vegetation cover fraction, and amount of water accumulated
    (Sun et al., 2022). The NDVI is given by the following equation: (4) In this equation,
    NIR is the Near Infrared spectral band and Red is the red spectral band (visible).
    The NDVI ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate high levels of
    vegetation and values close to -1 indicate low vegetation or non-vegetated areas.
    There are several other vegetation indices, including the green normalized difference
    vegetation index (GNDVI), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), ratio
    vegetation index (RVI), and red edge ratio vegetation index (RERVI) (Lu et al.,
    2015). However, NDVI and GNDVI perform better than the other indices in classifying
    vegetation areas (Song and Park, 2020). On the downside, NIR produces gray-scale
    imagery that is difficult for the human eye to comprehend. In addition to the
    visible spectrum, NIR is the reflected energy, meaning that an NIR light source
    is required to create an image. During the daytime, the sun produces plenty of
    IR light; however, at night, IR light sources (e.g., IR LEDs) are required to
    illuminate an area/object. However, cameras that utilize IR LEDs for illumination
    at night are limited in range (usually to no more than 500m). 4.2.2.3. IR/thermal
    Temperature is a critical environmental factor influencing plant physiological
    activity. Thermal photography is a powerful technique for real-time plant water
    stress monitoring, detecting plant diseases, estimating crop production, and plant
    phenotyping, because plant temperatures change rapidly under stress conditions.
    Thermal cameras use sensors that detect infrared radiation and display the temperature
    in a digital radiometric image. Two types of thermal cameras are available: cameras
    with scanning systems that can capture a point or line, and cameras with a two-dimensional
    infrared focal plane array. The two-dimensional infrared focal plane array simultaneously
    captures every aspect of an image. It is faster and more widely utilized. Thermal
    sensors have gained prominence in recent years as sensor technology has improved
    and costs have decreased. In thermal imaging, infrared (IR) radiation (heat) is
    converted into visible images that depict the spatial distribution of temperature
    differences in a scene viewed using a thermal camera (Havens and Sharp, 2016).
    A thermal imaging camera is often fitted with an infrared detector, typically
    in a focal plane array of micron-sized detecting elements or pixels (Havens and
    Sharp, 2016). For example, the senseFly ThermoMAP is a thermal infrared camera
    that consists of an integrated shutter for in-flight radiometric calibration (Raeva
    et al., 2019). Thermal imaging can be used to determine the thermal properties
    of any object that radiates heat in space and time (Vadivambal and Jayas, 2011).
    In addition, this technology is non-invasive, non-contact, and non-destructive.
    Agricultural fields have found several applications (Das et al., 2020) of this
    technology, such as plant disease detection and yield estimation (Das et al.,
    2020), crop/fruit/vegetable maturity and bruise determination (Santesteban et
    al., 2017), nursery and greenhouse monitoring, and temperature monitoring (Marques
    et al., 2020), among others (Vadivambal and Jayas, 2011). The crop water stress
    index (CWSI) (Idso et al., 1981), is the most widely used metric for monitoring
    plant water status using thermal imagery. The equation used to calculate CWSI
    (Messina and Modica, 2020) is as follows: (5) where Tc - Ta represents the temperature
    difference between the canopy and air. LL corresponds to the values of Tc - Ta
    indicating the lower limit, whereas UL represents the values indicating the upper
    limit. Thermal imagery is not frequently used because of the properties of thermal
    sensors, the geometric resolution, and the type of imagery produced by thermal
    cameras. Compared to thermal sensors, RGB sensors have a superior geometric resolution.
    However, thermal imaging has been proven to be more effective than other imaging
    technologies in applications where temperature monitoring is critical. 4.2.3.
    Hyperspectrum imaging (HSI) In HSI, a wide variety of bandwidths in the light
    spectrum are analyzed instead of simply assigning primary colors (red, green,
    and blue) to each pixel (Schneider and Feussner, 2017). In this process, the light
    striking each pixel in the image is broken down into dozens or hundreds of narrow
    spectral bands for high-precision detection and identification of the attribute
    information of ground objects (e.g., to find objects, detect processes, or identify
    materials). Hyperspectral sensors are used to collect HSI information as a set
    of images where an image represents a spectral band (narrow wavelength of the
    electromagnetic spectrum). For processing and analysis, these images are combined
    to form a three-dimensional (x,y,λ) hyperspectral data cube (Sousa et al., 2022).
    Here, x and y represent two spatial dimensions of the scene and λ represents the
    spectral dimension with various wavelength (Sousa et al., 2022). In Faiçal et
    al. (2017), hyperspectral images were analyzed to effectively distinguish the
    maize plant from other ground objects, and the stalk, leaf, and other components
    of the maize plant were clearly designated. This result shows that with a higher
    level of spectral detail, hyperspectral images have a stronger ability to distinguish
    objects than multispectral or visual spectrum images. Other studies have reported
    similar findings, noting that hyperspectral imagery can precisely identify multiple
    crop types captured using UAV-borne hyperspectral camera systems (Du et al., 2021;
    Nevalainen et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2022). These cameras can simultaneously acquire
    high spectral resolution (nanometer level) and high spatial resolution (centimeter
    level) remote sensing imagery. However, a major disadvantage of HSI is its large
    number of narrow spectral bands. With an increasing number of narrow bands (e.g.,
    300 bands), the redundancy between channels increases, with a high density of
    duplicate information requiring additional preprocessing (Zhong et al., 2020).
    In this case, principal component analysis (PCA) (Du et al., 2021) and continuous
    wavelet transform (CWT) (Sun et al., 2022) can be used to aggregate essential
    information into groups called principal components by identifying duplicate data
    over several channels (Bostan et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2022). 4.3. On the taxonomy
    of visual imagery datasets For the design and development of precision agriculture,
    the adoption of Machine Learning (ML) and statistical models for autonomous decision
    making is inevitable (Fig. 3). Relevant datasets are crucial for training models
    with acceptable accuracy. The use of UAVs for aerial image collection to develop
    such datasets is often underpinned by the quality, type, and size of the dataset
    to ensure improved performance. Several studies have developed crop datasets using
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are often mounted with sophisticated cameras
    to capture images of the required modalities. This section presents a summary
    of these datasets, highlighting the image modalities, UAV and camera configurations
    utilized, targeted crop type, and geolocation of data collection. Table 9 provides
    an exhaustive list of these available datasets according to their image modalities
    and describes their use in ML models (e.g., classification, segmentation, and
    regression) and data sources. Table 9. UAV based dataset reported and explored

    were documented using the Hyperspectral (HS1 in Table 9) modality. These were
    WHU-Hi-LongKou, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, WHU-Hi-Hon-gHu, and Deep potato datasets. All
    these datasets were used for crop classification through the training of deep
    learning models. Benchmark crop data were collected between 2017 and 2020 as benchmark
    crop data (Zhang et al., 2019). Both the WHU-Hi-LongKou and WHU-Hi-HanChuan datasets
    were collected using Aibot X6 UAV V1, and the WHU-Hi-Hon-gHu dataset was collected
    using DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV. Both the UAVs were mounted using a Nano-Hyperspec
    sensor. To capture images for the WHU-Hi-Longkou and WHU-HiHanchuan datasets,
    the UAV was set at an altitude of 500 m with a spatial resolution of 46.3 cm and
    an altitude of 250 m with a spatial resolution of 10.9 cm, respectively. The flight
    operation was conducted under clear, cloudless weather conditions. However, the
    WHU-Hi-Hon-gHu dataset was collected under cloudy weather conditions, and the
    flight altitude was set to 100 m with a GSD of 4.3 cm. The WHU-Hi-LongKou, WHU-Hi-HanChuan,
    and WHU-Hi-Hon-gHu datasets contain six, seven, and three types of distinct crop
    images, respectively. Another dataset, Deep Potato, aims to model crop measurement
    parameters in the precise form of HSI. Two different types of potatoes, Lady Claire
    and Markie, were observed at four different timelines in 2020 at three locations
    in Poland. Images were captured using a push-broom line imaging spectrometer with
    150 spectral bands in the range of 460-902 nm. Three datasets have been reported
    in the literature under the category of Multispectral dataset (acronym MS2 in
    Table 8) that utilizes RGB, RedEdge and NIR for data collection. These were the
    CHM-NDVI, SI-111 IRR Maize temperature, and vineyard affected by Botrytis cinerea
    datasets. The term CHM-NDVI is the abbreviated form of Canopy Height Model (CHM)
    and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which are used to define the
    canopy and calculate the tree crown area of a hazelnut orchard covering a land
    area of 6.68 ha in Italy. The high precision multi-rotor DJI Phantom 4 (P4) Multispectral
    UAV is used for data collection with the given configurations, altitude set at
    20 cm, Red Edge 730 nm ± 16 nm, and use Near Infrared (NIR). The recently formed
    dataset, Vineyard, affected by Botrytis cinerea, focuses on the variability of
    multispectral images in necrotrophic fungus-affected vineyards. The variability
    in various image acquisition parameters was like the variable tilt angles (0°,
    30°, and 45 °) and different times of the day at a fixed height of 30 m. A total
    of 16,504 images of MS2 modalities were collected from a DJI M210 multi-rotor
    platform UAV in addition to a MicaSense Rededge 3 camera. The dataset was annotated
    to emphasize image segmentation tasks, followed by trunk detection, plant isolation,
    and other tasks. SI-111 IRR temperature data were collected for white and yellow
    maize in South Africa. A 4-m meteorological tower was installed at the center
    of the maize field using two infrared radiometers (IRR) to record the plant canopy
    temperature. A DJI Matrice 300 (DJI M-300) UAV mounted with MicaSense Altum camera
    and Downwelling Light Sensor 2 (DLS-2) was used for areal image capture and processing
    (3576 images were taken per flight). Four datasets were found in the category
    of MS3 modality according to the classification in Table 8. These are Multispectral
    datasets that use RGB and NIR. These are Weedmap, WeedNet, NAIP, and JAI datasets.
    The Weedmap dataset (Sa et al., 2018b) was collected using RedEdge-M and Sequoia
    cameras mounted on a UAV. It contains 10,000 multispectral aerial images of sugar
    beet crops and weeds. The WeedNet dataset (Sa et al., 2018a) consists of 465 multispectral
    images of sugar beet crops. The images were collected using a four-channel Sequoia
    camera mounted on a UAV at an altitude of 2m. The JAI dataset (Lottes et al.,
    2017) contained 97 images of sugar beets captured using a UAV mounted with a 4-channel
    JAI AD-130 GE camera in Switzerland. The flight altitude was set to 2-3m. Finally,
    a tree database of 2,912 individual trees, known as the NAIP dataset, was developed
    for the continental Unites State over the years which is known as the NAIP dataset.
    The entire NAIP dataset comprised 65 terabytes. The Aerial sesame weed dataset
    (Moazzam et al., 2022) is the only Multispectral dataset (acronym MS8 in Table
    9) that utilizes Green, Blue and NIR channels. The dataset contains aerial images
    of sesame weeds in Pakistan to classify sesame crops and weeds. To capture the
    images, an Agrocam NDVI mounted on Phantom 3 standard UAV was flown at an altitude
    of 15 feet. Around twenty-three datasets were recorded from the existing literature
    that utilize the Visible Spectrum modality or RGB (acronym VS1 in Table 8) to
    develop the imagery dataset. All these datasets are listed in Table 9 under the
    VS1 modality category and are summarized below, based on the information available
    in the literature. Two rice crop datasets have been reported in literature: the
    Rice Seedling dataset (Yang et al., 2018) and the International Rice research
    (IRRI) dataset (database Rice Knowledge Bank, 2018). The Rice Seedling dataset
    was developed for Taiwan in 2020 by the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute
    (TARI). Two distinct UAV configurations of UAVs are used for data collection to
    mitigate environmental disturbances. They were a 4-rotor commercial range UAV,
    DJI Phantom 4 Pro and DJI Zenmuse X7 with an interchangeable lens camera. The
    International Rice research (IRRI) dataset contains rice disease data in four
    categories: bacterial light, sheath light, brown spot, and leaf blast. The Soybean
    leaf dataset (Amorim et al., 2019) and the Soybean herbivorous pests datasets
    (Amorim et al., 2019) were developed in Brazil in 2017 and 2018, where the earlier
    dataset contains 300 areal images and the later has 5000 images. For the Soybean
    leaf dataset, a Phantom 3 Professional UAV equipped with a 1/2.3-in Sony EXMOR
    sensor and a 12.3-megapixel camera was used. For the soybean herbivorous pest
    dataset, a Sony camera equipped with an IMX260 12-megapixel resolution sensor
    was used. The Haly-1D dataset (Halys identification) was developed to detect the
    presence of Halyomorpha Halys (HH) insects in the orchards. The Mavic2 Pro DJI
    UAV was used in this study. A dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaf images
    was created for 13 distinct plant leaves with 54,305 images. This dataset is called
    PlantVillage (Geetharamani and Pandian, 2019) having 38 classes, each labeled
    as a healthy or infected plant, using disease labels. The same individuals from
    the JAI dataset collected another set of RGB images, namely the MATRICE dataset.
    The MATRICE dataset consists of 31 images. A Zenmuse X3 camera mounted on a DJI
    Matrice 100 UAV was used at an altitude of 15 m to capture images. Both datasets
    provided the basis for evaluating the line features and analyzing the performance
    of crop/weed classification. MauFlex is an aerial imagery dataset of 96 representative
    Mauritia flexuosa swamps (Morales et al., 2018a). Images were captured by three
    distinct UAVs: the TurboAce UAV mounted with a Sony Nex-7 camera, SkyRanger UAV,
    and Mavic Pro UAV to capture 47, 28, and 21 variants, respectively. The high-resolution
    RGB imagery dataset, Avo-AirDB, enriches the resources for avocado research. A
    DJI Phantom 4 Pro flowed over 113 hectares for 984 4864×3648 pixel high-resolution
    images. Two annotation platforms: Make–Sens ai and APEER.com were used to classify
    each pixel into four classes: Small, Medium, Large, and background. The CRanberry
    Aerial Imagery Dataset (CRAID) (Akiva et al., 2020a) is the largest repository
    of aerial RGB imagery of cranberry fields and consists of 21,436 cranberry images.
    Images were collected using a Phantom4 drone with a camera setting of 100 ISO,
    1/240 shutter speed, and 5.0 F-Stop. The Tomato disease dataset was developed
    in China using a drone embedded with a camera equipped with GNSS (e.g., GPS) and
    CMOS sensors. Tomato disease mostly occurs on fruits and leaves and varies with
    depth in the region. Therefore, three different datasets were developed based
    on the following three regions Changping, Shunyi, and Thouzhou with each region
    having seven different categories of tomato disease. The Fig dataset was developed
    in Mexico in 2017 to address the complexity of fig plant segmentation in top-view
    RGB images (Fuentes-Pacheco et al., 2019a, Fuentes-Pacheco et al., 2019b). The
    images were captured using a 12-megapixel RGB camera attached to the quadcopter
    DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter through a 3-axis gimbal stabilization system. The flight
    altitude was set at approximately 20 m. The UAV Sugarbeet dataset (Datasets, 2015)
    was created using two sugar beet fields. For the first field, a DJI MATRICE 100
    UAV equipped with a Zenmuse X3 camera was used to capture images at a resolution
    of 4000 × 2250 pixels. The flight altitude was between 8 and 12 m. For the other
    field, a GoPro camera mounted on DJI Phantom 4 UAV was used to capture images
    at a resolution of 3840 × 2880 from an altitude between 10m and 18m. The CoFly-WeedDB
    dataset contains 201 annotated RGB images of three types of common weeds found
    in cotton fields in Greece. The images were captured using a camera mounted on
    a DJI Phantom Pro and annotated using the LabelMe annotation tool. Finally, the
    Vegetational optical aerial image (VOAI) dataset consisted of aerial images of
    12 tree species captured at low altitudes of 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, and 50 m using
    a UAV. 4.4. On the configuration of the UAVs UAVs are gaining rapid acceptance
    in remote sensing because of their low-cost acquisition, maintenance, and the
    option to mount miniature and affordable versions of satellite sensors, for example,
    RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and lightweight LiDAR (Watts et al.,
    2012). Another advantage of UAVs is their low-altitude flight paths for high-precision
    image acquisition. UAVs generally have varying configurations, the selection of
    which is often underpinned by the intended agricultural applications, required
    payload capacity, sensor types, flight control software, and take-off/landing
    zone space (Pádua et al., 2017). Using UAVs, high-resolution diagnostic information
    for mid-sized agricultural farms can be acquired in an efficient and timely manner.
    For instance, the accurate and early detection of crop conditions (e.g., how they
    react to treatments, weeds, pests, and other abnormalities) is possible for faster
    planning of effective resource management to minimize losses (Aasen et al., 2018;
    Inoue, 2020). The appropriate adoption of UAVs can also affect the classification
    accuracy of deep-learning models (Bouguettaya et al., 2022). Based on these facts,
    a longitudinal classification of the UAVs used in the reviewed articles was conducted
    in this study and is summarized in Table 10. This taxonomy accentuates the UAV
    configurations in relation to their size and adaptability, endurance, payload
    weight, flight time and speed, flight control, sensor, and camera specifications
    (both inbuilt and mounted), and manufacturer details. In the following section,
    we critically assess these configurations in relation to their agricultural applications.

    and multirotor categories based on their physical construction. Fig. 5 demonstrates
    this taxonomy along with its utility. Fig. 5 demonstrates this taxonomy along

    full-size image Fig. 5. Taxonomy of UAVs used for civilian applications. Large
    UAVs are modified versions of military platforms adapted for civilian applications
    that are presumably unsafe for manned aircraft, such as wildfire monitoring (Ambrosia
    et al., 2011). However, these UAVs are unsuitable for agricultural use because
    of their high cost and operational complexity. Medium UAVs are cheaper and less
    complex to operate; however, they are not appropriate for agricultural applications
    (Eskandari et al., 2020). These UAVs are often used for surveys (e.g., land characterization,
    Arctic, island, and coastal areas), disaster or ecosystem assessments, surveillance
    operations, and decision support (Herwitz et al., 2004; Watts et al., 2012). For
    agricultural applications, mostly small, mini, and micro UAVs are used because
    of their all-round suitability (Hardin and Jensen, 2011; Watts et al., 2012).
    UAVs in this category are lightweight (less than 20 kg), have an average flight
    time of a few minutes to a few hours, and are equipped with relatively cheap,
    miniaturized, but technologically advanced sensors and easy-to-operate flight
    control software (Berni et al., 2009a; Hardin and Jensen, 2011). Based on wing
    configuration, UAVs are classified into Fixed-wing and multi-rotor categories.
    With long-range, fast, high-altitude cruises and preset flight paths, fixed-wing
    UAVs are suitable only for large agricultural areas. Additionally, they require
    launch ramps, large landing corridors, and a low GSD (Ground Sampling Distance
    (GSD), making them unsuitable for many agricultural applications (Watts et al.,
    2012). In contrast, multi-rotor UAVs are the most suitable for agricultural applications,
    including inspection, surveying, crop scouting, crop yield estimation, precise
    agrochemical spraying (e.g., pesticides and fertilizers), and fighting invasive
    plants (Chen et al., 2021; Maimaitijiang et al., 2020b; Surekha et al., 2020;
    Zannou and Houndji, 2019). Multirotor UAVs have several advantages owing to their
    propeller-driven structure mounted around the core/body. For example, vertical
    take-off and landing, which require only a few square meters to take off and land,
    and low-altitude cruise are less prone to vibration and crash, can obtain high
    spatial resolution imagery, and can carry relatively higher payloads (Anderson
    and Gaston, 2013). However, owing to their slow cruising speeds, only small-to
    medium-sized farmlands can be covered. To overcome this limitation, several studies
    have proposed the use of UAV swarms that can quickly examine large farms (Albani
    et al., 2017; Bouguettaya et al., 2022). Regarding this classification, the reviewed
    articles reported the adoption of small and mini sized UAVs only. This study listed
    19 distinct UAVs, among which only three were fixed-wing, 14 were multi-rotor,
    one was a custom-built multi-rotor, and one was a hybrid (having both fixed-wing
    and multi-rotor) UAV, as detailed in the first column of Table 10. The three fixed-wing
    UAV models used were SenseFly eBee X (Böhler et al., 2018; Jintasuttisak et al.,
    2022), Draganfly X4P (Rajapaksa et al., 2018) and AggieAir (Elarab et al., 2015).
    Multirotor UAVs include Parrot Anafi and Bluegrass (Qi et al., 2021; Su et al.,
    2020), DJI Mavic 3, Phantom 4 Pro, Mavic Air 2, and Mavic 2 Pro (Feng et al.,
    2022; Prasad et al., 2022; Zannou and Houndji, 2019), among others. The hybrid
    UAV possesses both fixed and multirotor wing configurations to facilitate vertical
    takeoff and landing with a long flight time, and therefore overcomes the two shortcomings
    of both types (Song and Park, 2020). Among the UAV manufacturers, DJI is by far
    the most popular choice, followed by Parrot, SenseFly, Draganfly and Nuvemuav.
    The flying time of these UAVs varied from 15 to 180 min, the flight range varied
    from 1 km to 18.5 km, and the weight ranges between .89 kg and 9.5 kg. Sensors
    are an integral part of UAVs and are often used to capture images from different
    modalities (as discussed in Section 4.2). With technological advancements, visible
    spectrum (R, G, B), multispectral (e.g., R, G, B, NIR, Red-edge), hyper-spectral,
    short/mid-wave range (e.g., thermal), and lightweight LiDAR (Watts et al., 2012)
    sensors have been miniaturized to integrate in small/mini-sized UAVs either as
    in-built or mounted cameras. Therefore, acquiring high-quality images at different
    band ranges is achievable using sensors that can sense a portion of the electromagnetic
    radiation reflected from agricultural fields, thereby making precision and smart
    agriculture realistic (Dwivedi et al., 2022; Murugan et al., 2017a). Visible spectrum
    (RGB) cameras are the most used sensors owing to their superior tradeoff between
    cost and performance. Based on this configuration, these cameras can capture high
    spatial resolution imagery in three visible wavebands: the ed (R), green (g),
    and blue (B). However, their performance is often vulnerable to weather/atmospheric
    conditions, such as clouds and shadows, fog/mist, and sunlight angles, which often
    distort the captured imagery and adversely affect the performance of the intended
    classification and detection algorithms (Ahirwar et al., 2019). Multi-and hyperspectral
    sensors can effectively overcome many of these obstacles with additional benefits,
    but at a very high price. They also require experts to operate, capture, process,
    and analyze complex data. These cameras are less sensitive to environmental conditions
    and can capture additional information at wavebands beyond RGB. For instance,
    thermal NIR cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) imaging systems can
    be used to estimate crop diseases and height, and assess water stress and biomass
    (Brewer et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). In relation to the camera sensors used
    with UAVs, two approaches can be adopted: using an in-built camera that comes
    with UAVs and/or mounting a third-party camera with the required specifications.
    Sometimes, both are required for additional spectral information but at a higher
    price tag (Ponce et al., 2021; Su et al., 2020). A detailed taxonomy of the camera
    sensors (both built-in and mounted) used with the UAVs are listed in Column 2
    of Table 10. According to this table, seven UAVs are used with built-in cameras,
    four UAVs are used with mounted cameras (because they do not have built-in cameras),
    and for five UAVs, both built-in and mounted cameras are used. Mounted cameras
    are preferable when the UAVs do not have built-in cameras (e.g., SenseFly eBee
    X, DJI Matrice 100, DJI V8 October copter UAVs) or when additional bands are required
    other than RGB (e.g., NIR, red edge, Hyperspectral sensors). Among the mounted
    cameras, the Canon IXUS 125 HS, Parrot Sequoia multispectra, MicaSense RedEdge
    Multispectral, Micasense Altum, Headwall Nano-Hyperspec imaging sensor, Sentera
    multispectral imager, UHD185 spectrometer, GoPro Hero3 Black Edition, and Micasense
    Altum are the most used. Most of these cameras possess multispectral or hyperspectral
    sensors and support FHD to 4K/UHD video resolutions. Conversely, all built-in
    cameras support only RGB channels, with video resolutions varying between HD and
    4k. Table 10 summarizes the specific configurations of the camera sensors. Finally,
    a few studies have used custom-built multirotor UAVs to reduce procurement costs
    (Andritoiu et al., 2018; Bayraktar et al., 2020). They built a UAV by themselves
    and mounted a camera that best matched their price-performance trade-offs. For
    instance, in (Andritoiu et al., 2018), a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera to solve
    the stabilization issue caused by UAV. However, performance benchmarking against
    professionally optimized UAVs may pose a threat to the captured image quality
    and overall classification results of these studies. 4.5. Assessment of computer
    vision enabled agriculture Computer vision enables computers and other intelligent
    machines to analyze and understand visual information, such as that of humans.
    It trains machines to accurately detect and classify objects from images or videos,
    and then act accordingly. Computer vision plays a crucial role in UAV technology.
    It is responsible for the vision of UAVs, allowing them to identify obstacles
    in real-time and avoid collisions. Without this vision, a UAV merely captures
    images and videos, but lacks the intelligence to understand and interact with
    its surroundings, such as a digital camera. Classification, regression, segmentation,
    object detection, image registration, and reconstruction are some of the primary
    computer vision tasks used to achieve precision in UAV-assisted agriculture. UAVs
    with computer vision are employed in precision agriculture to monitor crop health,
    soil conditions, anomaly detection, and other agricultural applications, and can
    be broadly classified into four categories:1) crop classification, 2) crop disease
    detection, 3) crop yield estimation, and 4) process monitoring for precision agriculture,
    as illustrated in Fig. 6. This study identified and reviewed 119 studies using
    computer vision technologies for precision agriculture. Download : Download high-res

    vision tasks for precision agriculture. 4.5.1. Crop classification Crop classification
    is a fundamental activity in computer vision-based precision agriculture (CVPR).
    Identifying distinct crops in the field, assessing their state or stage, seedling
    detection, tracing crop growth, counting trees, classifying crop species, and
    other similar tasks are all parts of crop classification. However, the detection
    of crop diseases was not considered a crop classification task in this review.
    The classification of crops allows policymakers and stakeholders to monitor them.
    Most computer-vision tasks are related to crop classification. Approximately 43.7%
    (52 out of 119 papers) of CVPR related literature (Treboux and Genoud (2018);
    Liang et al. (2019); Barrero et al. (2016); Singh and Singh (2021); Tatini et
    al. (2022); Capucao and Palaoag (2018); Moazzam et al. (2022); Lottes et al. (2017);

    et al. (2017); De Castro et al. (2018b,a)) belong to crop classification, as shown
    in Fig. 6. Among these, 16 studies focused on detecting weeds in rice, sugarcane,
    sugar beets, and other crop fields. Detecting and controlling weed growth is important
    because weeds cause a reduction in crop yield and affect crop quality. Weeds also
    function as reservoirs for pests and crop diseases. Other popular crops classified
    into different groups were corn/maize, grapes, wheat, rice, and citrus. These
    classification systems utilize pixel-, object-, or patch-wise information from
    imagery for classification or segmentation using machine-learning or deep-learning-based
    models. In pixel-based crop classification, each pixel is classified as either
    a crop or background using a semantic segmentation model. This model assigns a
    label to a pixel in an image, which is then used to recognize a collection of
    pixels that form distinct classes. The SLIC (Csillik et al., 2018), U-Net (Fawakherji
    et al., 2019; Kattenborn et al., 2019; Trujillano et al., 2018) and SegNet (Sa
    et al., 2018c; Yang et al., 2020) models are popular for such classifications.
    There are two approaches for object-based classification: object detection and
    object-based image analysis (OBIA). Object detection methods detect the presence
    of a specific object in a bounding box. YOLO object detection methods are widely
    used for locating crops and trees, such as rice and palm trees (Egi et al., 2022;
    Tatini et al., 2022; Jintasuttisak et al., 2022; Wibowo et al., 2022). The OBIA
    approach clusters pixels based on similarity metrics to form objects using a segmentation
    model. The pixels of the same object are homogeneous under certain criteria. These
    objects were then classified using classification models. The approach of combining
    segmentation with classification is widely used in precision agriculture. In contrast
    to pixel- or patch-based classification methods, OBIA provides increased accuracy.
    The OBIA approach, which involves segmentation and classification of the segmented
    objects, is popular for mapping crops (De Castro et al., 2018b,a). In patch-based
    classification, the entire image is divided into small patches that can be overlapped
    or non-overlapped. The patch size can differ depending on the task and model.
    Most deep learning-based models accepts patches of size 224×224 pixels. A larger
    patch is good to reflect the global context of the images while a smaller patch
    is useful to focus on the local information. Selecting an appropriate patch size
    is important to attain good accuracy. Classification models mainly utilize patch-based
    approach, especially the CNN based models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 and ViT.
    These crop classification tasks were primarily performed using RGB images (67.3%;
    35 of 52 crop classification papers). Although multispectral and hyper-spectral
    imagery are popular and provide high classification accuracy, RGB imagery is more
    suitable for designing low-cost and simple systems. Motivated by the detailed
    information availability of multispectral and hyper-spectral imagery, some methods
    utilize multimodal imagery, in which RGB images are combined with multispectral
    or hyper-spectral images to train the models. The models and approaches used in
    computer vision-based agriculture can be divided into three categories:1) traditional
    machine-learning methods, 2) deep-learning methods, and 3) empirical feature-based
    algorithms. Traditional machine learning models use features extracted using a
    separate method or handcrafted features. GLCM, Haralick, and local binary pattern-based
    features are effective for use in machine learning models. Support vector machine
    (SVM) and random forest (RF) machine learning approaches are effective for binary
    classification in agriculture (Albetis et al., 2018; De Castro et al., 2018b;
    Mohite et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2018). Deep-learning-based models are a popular
    choice for researchers because of their automatic feature extraction and selection
    abilities, which yield better accuracy for most problems. The CNN (Liang et al.,
    2019; Moazzam et al., 2021; Moazzam et al., 2022; Ochoa and Guo, 2019), R-CNN
    (Biswal and Chestnut, 2022; Hosseiny et al., 2020; Machefer et al., 2020) and
    YOLO (Egi et al., 2022; Tatini et al., 2022; Wibowo et al., 2022) models are the
    most common. 4.5.2. Crop disease detection Crops are vulnerable to various diseases
    and environmental stresses, which can be classified as biotic or abiotic. Stresses
    or diseases triggered by pathogenic pests are considered biotic. The abiotic stressors
    include temperature, water, ultraviolet radiation, salinity, floods, drought,
    and heavy metals. The early detection of stress plays a crucial role in saving
    crops and increasing crop yields. In total, 20.2% (24/119) of the CVPR-related
    literature was covered by crop disease detection papers, as shown in Fig 6. Among
    these, 11 methods utilized RGB imagery, five multispectral, five hyperspectral,
    and three multimodal imageries. Multimodal imagery has been found to be highly
    effective in detecting crop stress and diseases. The fusion of RGB images with
    multispectral or thermal images allows the extraction of diverse features that
    improve the model accuracy without complicating the system. Major crop diseases
    detected using these methods include leaf spot (Suryawanshi and Khurjekar, 2021;
    Tetila et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019), pest disease (Chen et al., 2021; del Campo-Sanchez
    et al., 2019), wilt disease (Ha et al., 2017), blight (Sugiura et al., 2016) and
    yellow rust (Marin et al., 2021; Su et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019) detection.
    Other related detected diseases or causing diseases include nitrogen deficiency
    in corn (Zermas et al., 2020), lodging stress (Song et al., 2020; Sun et al.,
    2022), crop water stress (Brewer et al., 2022; Mohite et al., 2022; Poblete et
    al., 2017; Sankaran et al., 2018), bud rot in palm (Montero and Rueda, 2018).
    Crop disease detection is performed by estimating the vegetation index or detecting
    the disease using machine learning or deep learning methods. The vegetation index
    is a single value that indicates the presence of green objects in an image. Green
    pixels are generated by image transformation. The vegetation index estimation
    is a well-accepted approach in precision agriculture (Matese and Di Gennaro, 2021;
    Tendolkar et al., 2021) and can be applied to RGB, multispectral, and hyper-spectral
    modalities. However, machine-learning- and deep-learning-based data-driven approaches
    have become more popular in recent studies. SVM (Mohite et al., 2022; Song et
    al., 2020; Zermas et al., 2020), RF (Mohite et al., 2022; Su et al., 2018b; Tetila
    et al., 2017), and k-means (Zermas et al., 2020) are the most popular machine
    learning models. CNN (Biswal and Chestnut, 2022; Suryawanshi and Khurjekar, 2021),
    R-CNN (Biswal and Chestnut, 2022), YOLO (Chen et al., 2021), U-Net (Song et al.,
    2020; Su et al., 2020), and GAN (Prasad et al., 2022) based deep models were found
    to be more effective than the other models. Among the U-Net-based models, SegNet
    achieved the highest accuracy in detecting tree-lodging stress (Song et al., 2020).
    As deep learning technology matures day by day, the detection of crop diseases
    has become more limited with in-depth analysis in recent studies (Bouguettaya
    et al., 2023; Shahi et al., 2023). 4.5.3. Crop yield estimation The yield estimation
    of crops based on UAV imagery is another major CVPR task. Several methods have
    been proposed for yield estimation with the intention of maximizing crop yield
    at minimum cost (Ashapure et al., 2019b; Escalante et al., 2019; García-Martínez
    et al., 2020; Geipel et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2020; Maimaitijiang et al., 2020b;
    Matese and Di Gennaro, 2021; Nevavuori et al., 2020; Shafiee et al., 2021; Wan
    et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021a; Yang et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2017a; Zhou et
    al., 2021).These methods are primarily used for maize, rice, corn, soybeans, wheat,
    tomatoes, and barley. Yield estimation methods use a two-layer architecture. The
    first layer extracts features that are then fed into a predictive model to predict
    the crop yield in the second layer. Most of these methods achieve automatic feature
    extraction using deep-learning models, whereas some methods use handcrafted features
    (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020b). The predictive layer was mainly based on regression
    analysis. Regression-based models, such as linear regression, LASSO regression,
    and support vector regression, have been found to be effective when trained with
    automatically extracted features. For example, (Shafiee et al., 2021) showed that
    both support vector and LASSO regression achieved good performance R2 = 0.90 for
    yield estimations. However, LASSO regression required a comparatively shorter
    training time. The random forest method achieves a slightly lower R2 value. It
    was 0.85 for rice (Wan et al., 2020), 0.80 for vine (Matese and Di Gennaro, 2021)
    and 0.72 for soybean (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020b) estimation. However, most recent
    studies have tended to rely on deep learning-based technology for both feature
    extraction and yield prediction. Among the 18-yield estimation-based studies,
    11 utilized deep learning models. The fusion of RGB and multispectral imagery
    is widely used for yield estimation. RGB imagery is the most common because it
    is useful for designing low-cost automated yield estimation systems (Ashapure
    et al., 2019b; Escalante et al., 2019; Geipel et al., 2014; Nevavuori et al.,
    2020; Zhou et al., 2021). Eight of the 17 yield estimation methods utilized RGB
    imagery, followed by the fusion of RGB and multispectral imagery (6 out of 17).
    Multispectral images have been reported to achieve high predictive performance
    (Shafiee et al., 2021; Xu et al. (2021a). Therefore, several studies have combined
    RGB with multispectral images to train machine learning models (García-Martínez
    et al., 2020; Maimaitijiang et al., 2020b; Wan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019b;
    Zhou et al., 2017a). 4.5.4. Agricultural process monitoring CVPR tasks include
    determining harvest time (Keita et al., 2022), detecting and interpreting crop
    transplanted positions (Shih et al., 2021), detecting healthy plant fields (Wijitdechakul
    et al., 2016), detecting soil contamination (Jia et al., 2021), counting plants,
    fruits, or leaves (Egi et al., 2022; Kitano et al., 2019; Machefer et al., 2020;
    Pang et al., 2020; Koh et al., 2019), and monitoring crops (d’Andrimont et al.,
    2022; Hunt Jr et al., 2010; Luna and Lobo, 2016; Raeva et al., 2019), estimating
    canopy (Al-Arab et al., 2013), mapping crop density (Piani et al., 2021) and detecting
    plucking area (Junagade et al., 2022) considered as agricultural processing monitoring
    tasks. Deep learning-based models based on RGB imagery are primarily utilized
    for agricultural monitoring tasks. This review identified 18 processing monitoring
    methods (out of 26) that utilize RGB imagery. 4.6. Geo diversity of UAV adoption
    in agriculture UAVs equipped with state-of-the-art sensors have been effectively
    deployed for timely acquisition of high-resolution diagnostic information on agricultural
    farms. Mid-sized agricultural firms or farmlands that are fragmented into smaller
    cultivation lands (traditionally found in Asian countries such as Bangladesh,
    Japan, India, and Pakistan) can be most effectively managed by these technologies.
    According to the reviewed articles, several countries worldwide are aggressively
    adopting this remote-sensing technology for the development of agricultural monitoring
    and management ecosystems that can cover diverse segments of agricultural crops.
    Therefore, this review provides an exhaustive summary of the reviewed articles
    and classifies crops according to their geographical distribution. Fig. 7 shows
    a summary heatmap of the research concentration in relation to the geolocation
    (i.e., countries and continents) where it has been conducted. The findings show
    that Asian countries are leading the domain followed by the American continent.
    China and India are the front-runners in this segment, with 26% of the overall
    research publications, followed by the USA and Spain, with 20% of the research
    output. Europe, Italy, and Spain lead this segment. Download : Download high-res

    Bananas are highly consumed fruits prone to loss during the early vegetation phase.
    Therefore, in (Neupane et al., 2019) the banana plants were automatically counted
    with precision from aerial images that were captured using an RGB camera and the
    characteristics of banana plant growth in the multispectral domain (Aeberli et
    al., 2023). In (Kadethankar et al., 2021) conducted an aerial investigation of
    coconut tree crowns to detect Rhinoceros beetle infestation, which is otherwise
    extremely tedious for farmers. These crops are mass-grown in Asian coastal countries
    such as Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and India. The Date palm tree is one of the most important
    economic crops in the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, and North Africa. Therefore,
    in (Jintasuttisak et al., 2022) drone-based surveillance for automated palm tree
    plantation management (e.g., counting the number of trees and their locations,
    monitoring health) and forecasting production. In (Quiroz et al., 2019), 14 RGB
    images of 2207 Mango trees were captured for the segmentation of individual trees.
    This study suggests that issues related to the elimination of false trees and
    surrounding forests need to be considered for better results. For Citrus production,
    consistent monitoring of seedling development, counting of the number of bearing
    trees, and pest management are necessary (Osco et al., 2021). Therefore, the application
    of a UAV-based multispectral image of a citrus field was evaluated by (La Rosa
    et al., 2020) and (Donmez et al., 2021) to accomplish these tasks. In (Sa et al.,
    2017) directly applied a CNN-based pixel-wise segmentation model to multispectral
    images of sugar beet fields to distinguish weeds from crops. A similar study was
    conducted by (Lottes et al., 2017) to precisely identify weeds on a per-plant
    basis in the intra-row space in the field. In studies by (Murugan et al., 2017a;
    Singh and Singh, 2021) and Murugan et al., 2016), UAV images of Sugarcane field
    are used for the classification of sparse and dense vegetation, large sugarcane
    plant height estimation (De Souza et al., 2017), and disease detection (Amarasingam
    et al., 2022). Approximately half of the world’s population consumes rice as a
    staple food, and 85% of this consumption occurs in Asia (Jia et al., 2021). Therefore,
    rice quality measurement, determination of the number of rice seedlings, and cultivation
    density approximation are required for a precise estimation of the yield (Jia
    et al., 2021). Studies (Jia et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2019) and (Der Yang et
    al., 2020) have investigated the feasibility of using UAV images of rice fields
    to estimate the same in China. In (Xu et al., 2021b), the Cotton crop field in
    Pakistan is observed with a low-altitude UAV flight for clear recognition of cotton
    bolls/blooms and densely planted plants. Similarly, UAVs equipped with multispectral
    cameras were used by Treboux and Genoud, 2018) to carryout object-based classification
    of grapevines in Switzerland. In China, Pakistan and Ukraine, Wheat production
    is observed by monitoring crop growth patterns (e.g., seeding, tillering, booting,
    heading, and ripening) and quantifying yellow rust disease in wheat fields using
    supervised multiclass classifiers (Lysenko et al., 2017; Prasad et al., 2022;
    Su et al., 2020). The Maize/Corn yield is of great significance for global food
    security. However, several associated factors can cause a decrease in maize yield
    and deterioration in grain quality (Hall et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2022). This
    includes the tall structure of maize plants, which leads to lodging stress, excessive
    cultivation density, water stress, and unreasonable fertilization. These issues
    hinder the normal growth of maize, reduce its photosynthetic rate, and make harvesting
    large fields difficult. Therefore, in studies (Feng et al., 2022) and (Chew et
    al., 2020), ultra-low altitude flights were operated using UAVs equipped with
    hyperspectral sensors over a corn field to analyze the lodging grades. An accurate
    measurement of this load assists farmers in estimating yield loss, calculating
    expected production, and implementing post-stress field management. In the modern
    diet, peanuts are highly valued because of their superior nutritional value (e.g.,
    rich in proteins and vitamins), which effectively reduce the incidence of cardiovascular
    diseases (Qi et al., 2021). Therefore, in (Qi et al., 2021) the chlorophyll content
    of two types of peanut leaves, namely, Yanghua 1 and Yueyou 45 is measured from
    the imagery captured by a Parrot Bluegrass UAV equipped with a multispectral sensor.
    This study aimed to evaluate the fertilization status of peanuts. For low-density
    crops such as potato fields, customized monitoring using UAV imagery and classification
    was carried out by (Machefer et al., 2020) for the optimal use of logistics and
    resources. For example, by identifying each potato, farm managers could localize
    herbicide spraying, estimate the emergence rate, target the watering strategy
    for the crop, and predict the yield. In Brazil, 300 aerial images were captured
    in soybean fields to detect diseases that were mostly identifiable from the upper
    stratum of the plant (leaves) (Amorim et al., 2019), and the outcomes were evaluated
    by experts and farmers to ensure the usability of the UAVs in monitoring and controlling
    pests in soybean fields. 5. Discussion and pave to future works Although the adoption
    of UAVs equipped with cutting-edge sensory cameras has gained momentum to address
    several agricultural process automations, a full-fledged framework for real-time
    remote-sensing precision agricultural systems is yet to be realized. To date,
    systems ideally capture images of diverse modalities using UAVs, which are then
    evaluated either by experts (manually) or AI-based DL models for automated or
    semi-automated detection, classification, or segmentation (Feng et al., 2022;
    Moazzam et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019a). However, a real-time system has not
    been developed to integrate all the constituent system components (i.e., UAVs,
    processing and storage units, and communication channels) for instantaneous data
    processing to offer observations and decisions and to take in situ actions for
    agricultural management. One constraint hindering the worldwide adoption of UAV-based
    precision agriculture is the lack of flight regulations and legislations for operating
    UAVs (Pádua et al., 2017). Many countries, particularly Asian and African countries,
    still lack proper legislation for regulating the use of UAVs for commercial, leisure,
    military, and scientific purposes. This often hinders the scientific adoption
    and commercial deployment of UAV-based agricultural monitoring infrastructure.
    Therefore, investigative and suggested guidelines for deriving legislation must
    be considered with utmost care in the future (Cracknell, 2017). Based on Fig.
    6, deep learning-based models are becoming popular for precision agriculture because
    of their ability to transfer weights from a well-trained model to another model
    for performing similar tasks while being explicitly trained. However, some studies
    reported overfitting. Typically, models become overfitted when trained with a
    limited and homogeneous dataset. Using an ensemble architecture in which multiple
    separately trained models are stacked together could be an efficient solution
    for handling overfitting issues (Hossain et al., 2022a). Several machine and deep
    learning models have been reported to achieve high accuracy in CVPR tasks. The
    SVM was found to be very promising for crop classification when trained with a
    comparatively smaller dataset. Linear regression was effective for yield estimation.
    YOLO- and unet-based segmentations are efficient for segmenting crop diseases
    or pests. The vanilla U-Net, SegNet, and Yolo models had the best results for
    detecting crops such as maize, wheat, and legumes. Crop features vary in terms
    of texture, color, and other visual aspects and can be extracted using the automatic
    feature selection approach of CNN architectures. Moreover, semantic segmentation
    models can achieve satisfactory accuracy when trained using small datasets suitable
    for agriculture. In agriculture, capturing images and generating large datasets
    are difficult. The analysis of CVPR-related papers revealed a clear shift toward
    deep learning methodologies. However, these methods require many images for training,
    which is often very difficult and expensive to achieve. Therefore, semi-supervised,
    weakly supervised or unsupervised techniques can be explored to reduce data dependency.
    Few-shot learning has also been investigated. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) enables
    a pretrained model to generalize over a new task using only a few training images.
    Vision-transfer-based models have recently gained popularity in two fields: natural
    language processing and computer vision. The amount of research on CVPR using
    vision transformers such as ViTs is limited. ViT is highly efficient for detecting
    important areas in images using a self-attention mechanism. Thus, using ViT models
    to detect harvest zones or stressed areas in agricultural fields is an intriguing
    topic for future research. The quality and color distribution of imagery play
    crucial roles in training machine learning models. Therefore, image quality evaluation
    and color normalization are routinely performed in computer vision tasks before
    images are fed into the model (Hossain et al., 2018, Hossain et al., 2022b). Image
    quality evaluation and color correction methods suitable for UAV imagery should
    be designed in the future. A related concern is that for effective adoption of
    Machine Learning (ML) and statistical models, a substantial number of UAV-based
    aerial datasets of crops/trees or farmlands are pivotal. The accuracy and performance
    of these models are often underpinned by the size, quality, modality, and type
    of the dataset. Although few studies have taken the necessary measures to offer
    such datasets (as can be verified from Table 9), they fall short of being comprehensive
    in terms of their size, annotation, geo-tagging, diversity (i.e., crop/vegetation
    types, crop development stages, and modalities), freedom of access, and use, among
    others. In addition, the datasets often differ in spatial, temporal, and spectral
    resolutions and geometric accuracy, which leads to further issues in the analysis
    (Mancini et al., 2019). Therefore, the development of standardized datasets addressing
    these issues should be a motivation for future research. The selection of the
    image modality plays a decisive role in acquiring distinct features of the subject
    matter, as detailed in Section 4.2. With the increasing number of bands in the
    electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., multispectral or hypersepctral), the number of
    observed features for a subject continues to increase. This allows for an in-depth
    understanding of the diverse characteristics that can be combined to derive meaningful
    conclusions. For example, in (Kattenborn et al., 2019; Wijitdechakul et al., 2016)
    it is argued that combining high spectral and spatial resolutions leads to better
    plant identification accuracy. However, increasing the spectral resolution also
    increases the cost of procuring expensive hyperspectral sensors and is overburdened
    by the complex computation of the collected data because of overlapping between
    the narrower bands. Therefore, future studies should focus on a well-judged selection
    of modalities, considering their impact on the intended outcomes and offer a rigorous
    comparative assessment of the use of images of different modalities. Moreover,
    UAV configuration and related properties are essential for pragmatic agricultural
    applications and improving the performance of deep learning models. Factors such
    as endurance, flight range, flight speed, payload, stabilization, altitude, and
    camera configuration (e.g., modalities, resolution, and field of view (FOV)) play
    pivotal roles in improving UAV efficiency and classification accuracy (Pádua et
    al., 2017). As detailed in Section 4.4, mostly small UAVs with wing configurations
    of either fixed-wing or multirotor are used in related research. While the former
    offers large-area coverage, they are prone to motion blur due to high speed and
    altitude and are not suitable for medium agricultural land. The latter is highly
    suitable for most agricultural applications; however, it does not cover large
    areas. In addition, the selection of UAVs in research is often biased towards
    affordability rather than capability and ease of data acquisition and processing,
    which naturally hinders the reported results. Consequently, UAVs that are easy
    to procure with reasonable configuration are deployed for remote sensing (Table
    10 lists the UAV configurations). Visible spectrum (RGB) or multispectral (mainly
    NIR band) camera sensors are mostly used in studies with a limited deployment
    of hyperspectral sensors. Therefore, future research should consider utilizing
    UAVs and associated technologies that are the best fit for this study. For instance,
    Albani et al. (2017) and Abualigah et al. (2021) suggested the use of a multi-rotor
    UAV swarm or the development of an intelligent Internet of Drones (IoD) system
    to cover large farmlands quickly. Additionally, powerful in-flight lightweight
    versions of deep learning algorithms should be deployed for in situ decision-making
    and action performance (e.g., pesticide spray or taking critical images), which
    would also minimize the power consumption for increasing flying time. Several
    other studies have explored the utility of UAVs in indoor farming as well (Aslan
    et al., 2022; Krul et al., 2021). Finally, our classification of crops with respect
    to geo-distribution (refer to Section 4.6) found that the selection of crops is
    often underpinned by two criteria: (a) importance of the crop in relation to food
    safety, economic importance for a geo-location, and the performance of the deployed
    system concerning its intended application (e.g., classification/segmentation
    accuracy of the DL models). However, it should be noted that the characteristics
    of crops, such as texture, color, size, and spatial distribution, vary significantly
    with geographical location (Wu et al., 2020) and at different growth stages (Niu
    et al., 2019). In addition, crops such as fruit trees and bush crops are often
    planted at low densities with large distances between the trees, which is significantly
    different from other crops such as rice, wheat, and sugarcane. These properties
    have a significant impact on the performance of deep learning algorithms; hence,
    a system performing well for one geolocation might underperform in other locations
    for the same crop (Capucao and Palaoag, 2018). Therefore, future studies must
    diversify crop selection by considering the above-mentioned heterogeneity of crop
    characteristics for increased accuracy and adaptability. 6. Validation of the
    study A systematic literature review is mostly a manual task and subject to interpretation
    (Kitchenham et al., 2010). Therefore, researcher bias is the most likely threat
    to the validity of the results (Kitchenham et al., 2010). To minimize this concern,
    the biblical process for conducting an SLR is adopted in this study, the detailed
    documentation of which is presented in Section 3. In this process, the research
    questions were defined based on the review objective, and the article inclusion
    criteria and search keywords were defined based on the research questions. Adhering
    to the inclusion criteria, articles were collected in a three-step process: automated
    keyword search in digital libraries, manual selection of shortlisted articles,
    and checking the references for the manually selected articles. This process ensured
    that the selected articles were representative and complete (Keele et al., 2007;
    Kitchenham and Charters, 2007). Furthermore, the review of the selected articles
    is subjective and susceptible to researcher bias (Kitchenham et al., 2010). To
    mitigate this issue, domain experts cross-checked the obtained data against the
    reviewed papers and research questions to guarantee proper interpretation and
    presentation (Kitchenham et al., 2010). 7. Conclusions The use of UAV-based remote
    sensing in precision agriculture is becoming a mainstream technology owing to
    its low cost, high resolution, and flexible observations of crops and soils for
    optimal management of farmlands. Therefore, ample research has been conducted
    on the adoption of UAVs and machine learning models to acquire remotely sensed
    high-resolution multispectral imagery of agricultural lands for autonomous analysis,
    decision support, and action performance. These include crop monitoring, diagnosis
    of crop growth, water stress and soil fertility, pesticide spraying, irrigation,
    and weed detection, among others, with optimum cost, labor, and energy consumption.
    In this study, an in-depth survey of contemporary research was conducted following
    the biblical SLR method to summarize existing research and obtain an overarching
    understanding of the intellectual structure of UAV adoption for agriculture. The
    distinctive contribution of this study is multifold, which includes a detailed
    manifestation of the framework to develop a real-time remote sensing agricultural
    management system using UAVs, an extensive investigation of the all-round competency
    of the UAVs against alternative technologies (e.g., satellites, manned aircrafts,
    and ground vehicles) in implementing precision agricultural applications, and
    documentation of the impact of UAV-based imagery modalities and available imagery
    datasets for the development of machine learning-based models. Thereafter, a categorical
    evaluation of the UAV configuration and a detailed scrutiny of the application
    of AI methods for agricultural process automation were carried out. An exclusive
    summary of the geodiversity of UAV adoption and taxonomy of agricultural crops
    and plants was also conducted. Finally, a pave for future work along the track
    is derived based on an executive summary of the contributions reported in this
    study. Overall, this study offers a comprehensive single-point reference for researchers,
    techno-professionals, and agricultural experts to gather overarching knowledge
    to decide on future agricultural endeavors using UAV-based remote sensing technologies.
    For instance, knowing the capability of UAVs and the impact of imaging modalities
    utilized in research to date, researchers can decide on the next experimental
    setup with improved or blended technologies for greater coverage of agricultural
    services and enhancement of accuracy and efficiency. Similarly, techno professionals
    can choose from an empirically verified set of UAVs and associated technologies
    to design and develop remote-sensing precision agricultural applications. Acknowledgments

    Precision irrigation is a water-saving technique that minimizes wastage and maximizes
    water requirements based on the actual needs of the plant, both in terms of water
    and nutrients, following site-specific soil texture and characteristics [1]. To
    date, precision irrigation aims to fulfill the growing food demand of an increasingly
    expanding population while minimizing environmental impact such as e.g., greenhouse
    gasses and fuel consumption [2]. In this regard, the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) has predicted that by 2050 there will be an increase
    of more than 50 percent in irrigated food production. This will lead to a 10 percent
    increase in water withdrawn in agriculture due to the raising productivity needs
    [3]. At the same time, climate change will affect the availability of water, generating
    conflicts between human activity depending on water, including crop productions
    and therefore also threatening food security [4]. The efficient use of water resources
    is essential to pursue sustainable development and to achieving the Sustainable
    Development Goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially in developing
    world. The water related European policies, the Water Framework Directive [5]
    first, promote water use efficiency to pursue the quantitative and qualitative
    protection of water. The Farm to Fork strategy [5], (declining the Green Deal
    initiative in the agri-food sector) and its application within the Common Agricultural
    Policy also go in the direction of guiding the transition towards a fair, healthy
    and environmentally-friendly food system. Together with the Biodiversity strategy,
    it proposes ambitious actions and commitments to achieve specific objectives by
    2030, requiring the agri-food system to review its production models, also to
    tackle climate change and protect the environment and biodiversity. One of the
    advantages of precision irrigation is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
    thanks to the improvement of the carbon reserve function of the soil. New precision
    irrigation technologies can be applied to greenhouse gas mitigation measures by
    significantly reducing the amount of inputs that are responsible for the contribution
    of greenhouse gasses and could contribute to the goal of minimizing the impact
    agriculture on climate change [6]. This is the rationale that has raised many
    concerns, not only among agronomists who see water use efficiency for crop purposes
    only, but also among researchers because, besides inferior productions, low water
    quantity can cause adverse effects and lead to really significant climate change.
    These pressing concerns have prompted several sectors to reevaluate agricultural
    water use strategies the way water is used in agriculture, embracing innovative
    monitoring strategies for optimal irrigation use that take into account site-specific
    soil texture, moisture conditions, weather changes, and plant physiological conditions
    [7]. Smart, precision agriculture and DSS (Decision Support Systems) represent
    innovative approaches to monitor and increase the irrigation performances in comparison
    to traditional methods [8] and to reduce use of nutrient [9], contributing to
    reduce agricultural pressure on water quality and quantity. Lower water use due
    to precision irrigation could mitigate water scarcity caused by climate change
    [10]. In fact, considering water scarcity as the condition in which the availability
    of water resource is insufficient compared to its demand, reducing the demand
    for water helps prevent scarcity [11]. Over the past 100 years, global water demand
    has grown twice as fast as the world''s population increase. And with climate
    change in between, the situation is set to get worse in the coming decades. By
    2050, in fact, water scarcity will grow for 80% of agricultural land worldwide.
    This is revealed by a study of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that has developed
    a more complete index of water availability measurement than those used so far.
    The researchers have integrated in a single index is the so-called blue water,
    that is, the water supply that derives from irrigation from rivers, lakes and
    aquifers, both the green water, that is, the water that remains in the soil, available
    to plants, and rainfall drift. Until now, measurements were made without taking
    into account green water [11]. Water deficiency can be identified via the Water
    stress index (WSI). Initially this index was born to prevent food self-sufficiency
    in the light of the future expected droughts and a growing population in Africa.
    For this reason, the WSI has become the most widely applied measure for testing
    water scarcity. The WSI originally defined water scarcity in terms of the number
    of people competing to be supported by a single unit of water flow [12]. In 1981
    a stress index for crop water (CWSI) was formulated, based on the temperature
    difference between crown and air (T c T a) [13]: where (Tc - Ta) is measured foliage–air
    temperature differential, (Tc - Ta)LL expected lower limit of (Tc - Ta) in the
    case of a canopy which is transpiring at the potential rate, and (Tc - Ta)UL expected
    differential in the case of a non-transpiring canopy. Along with water availability
    to the plant, also its quality plays a crucial role. The Irrigation Water Quality
    Index (IWQI) [14]. Although the Index has been developed for potability assessment,
    it is used for agricultural purposes as well. El Behairy et al. [14] carried out
    a study assessing and classifying the IWQI using GIS for sustainable agricultural
    purposes. Indeed, the index include a series of parameters that are weighted such
    as i.e. salinity hazard, specific ion toxicity, trace element toxicity (Arsenic,
    Chloride, Cobalt, copper etc.) and others. The main function of precision irrigation
    is to safeguard water management because it allows to provide plants with the
    appropriate amount of irrigation water responding to the needs of crops in different
    periods of time without stress. Therefore, crop productivity is maximized with
    a minimum amount of water [15]. Among DSS, Irrigation advice systems are a useful
    tool for quantifying the water savings guaranteed by an irrigation investment,
    required by the regulations of the European investment funds (ESI) and by cohesion
    policy funds as a precondition for funding; this through the quantification of
    water amount used “ex ante” and “ex post”. At national level, the DSS as Irrigation
    advice systems have also been identified as potential tools for estimating the
    volumes withdrawn and used at regional and local level, where it was not technically
    and economically possible to install the meter. This as part of the regulatory
    actions aimed at applying water price policies based on quantification of water
    volume, implemented to comply with the ex-ante conditionalities for water resources
    applicable to the EAFRD (European agricultural fund for rural development) [16].
    Smart irrigation requires sensors to monitor soil, plant, and weather conditions.
    Through data acquisition and modeling, sensors allow the definition of precise
    differential inputs on the base of crops specific needs and thus to provide the
    necessary amount of water, avoiding over-irrigation and under-irrigation [17].
    Modern technologies not only optimize water requirements and decrease pollution,
    but also reduce costs and manual labor. In fact, farmers can easily monitor various
    parameters on smartphones or other computing devices to guide their decisions
    manually or intelligently [12]. As reported by Abioye et al. [18], 90 percent
    of farmers agree that better irrigation management through the use of mobile and
    web applications can help improve the yield and productivity of their farms. Moreover,
    historical database can help planning appropriate farming management activities.
    In general, as reported by Plaščak et al. [19], the first strategy to be evaluated
    in precision irrigation is the combination of crop and soil monitoring and crop
    growth simulation. Once this strategy is identified, the four actions underlying
    precision irrigation, namely data collection, data analysis, and system monitoring
    and evaluation, must be undertaken. In fact, precision irrigation systems require
    spatially accurate and up-to-date data through measurements taken in the field
    and collected with an array of sensors. Then, the data obtained are interpreted
    and analyzed by software to aid decision making. Finally, all the previous steps
    are implemented to avoid waste focusing on real agricultural needs allowing water
    conservation over time [20]. In light of the panorama outlined above, this review
    work expanded the scope of the literature in this research area. In detail, bibliometric
    analysis was performed as a research method to explore the structure and characteristics
    of scientific articles published on the topic of precision irrigation. Specifically,
    publications from 2001 to 2023 on Scopus were extracted to perform a bibliometric
    mapping and analysis. Then, the publications retrieved were analyzed through CiteSpace
    software (6.2.R2 −64-bit- Basic); [21] from which 10 clusters were identified
    based on the keywords used by the authors in the publications. This software allows
    you to analyze quotes in each article based on quotes from all other articles.
    Next, the software automatically creates identified clusters, based on the amount
    of cross-referencing by naming each cluster [21]. The identified clusters are
    discussed with reference to publications after 2020. A time scan of the publications
    on precision irrigation was also carried out, obtaining the list of the 20 strongest
    keywords used in the years included in the search. 2. Advanced bibliometric review
    on precision irrigation 2.1. Database search The Scopus database was accessed
    on February 27, 2023, and used to retrieve bibliographic records related to precision
    irrigation research for the period 2001–2023; 1688 publications were identified
    in the initial stages. The SCOPUS database was chosen because it contains one
    of the largest selections of scientific literature in the natural sciences [22].
    To identify relevant publications on precision irrigation, the following keywords
    were used in the combined title, abstract, and keyword fields (for each publication):
    “precision irrigation” AND “smart irrigation”. Because the Scopus search was conducted
    in February 2023, publications from 2022 to 2023 had not yet been fully entered
    into the Scopus database by Scopus staff and may be underestimated. Only terms
    that recurred in the combined title, abstract, or keyword fields at least in ten
    publication were extracted [23]. A RIS file for this search is included in Supplementary
    Information S1. 2.2. CiteSpace software CiteSpace software is designed to answer
    questions about a knowledge domain, which is a broadly defined concept covering
    a scientific field, research area, or scientific discipline. A knowledge domain
    is typically represented by a set of bibliographic records of relevant publications.
    The goal of CiteSpace is the analysis and visualization of networks. Through network
    modeling and visualization, the intellectual landscape of a knowledge domain can
    be explored [21]. Clusters are created using the tf-idf algorithm. This algorithm
    converts the different forms of the word and that of the same root into a single
    form by selecting word suffixes from the same root [24,25]. In this work, CiteSpace
    was used to examine documents related to precision irrigation between 2001 and
    2023. Keyword clustering analysis was performed which is then performed on the
    keyword co-occurrence network to obtain a knowledge map of keyword clustering
    analysis with 10 main clustering keywords. Subsequently, the analysis was performed
    to obtain the 20 keywords in strength over the period 2001–2023, thanks to which
    it was possible to estimate the year in which they began and ended their burst
    strength. In detail, the table with 20 keywords in strength was obtained through
    the Citation Burst function, which represents the detection of a burst event,
    which can last for several years and for a single year. A series of quotations
    indicates that a particular publication is associated with a wave of quotations.
    The explosion of citations in the CiteSpace occurs through the Kleinberg algorithm
    [26]. Through Citation Burst History is able to generate a summary list of articles
    associated with citations. This view shows which references have the strongest
    citation outbursts and the time periods when the strongest outbursts occurred
    [21]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Number of publications Fig. 1 shows the trend
    in the number of publications on precision irrigation over time. From the graph,
    we can see that in 2001, publications appeared in almost no quantity until 2006.

    Fig. 1. The numbers of publications per year. In 2007, publications started to
    increase significantly, and by 2018 a total of 125 publications were detected
    in Precision Irrigation. By 2022, publications totalled 320. A first Increase
    in Publications occurred in 2007. In this period, we begin to talk about precision
    irrigation associated to wireless sensor network (Moisture Sensors of the Soil),
    control automatic system, drip irrigation and mathematical models to measure water
    management. Also, in 2019 there is a Second Increase in Publications. In these
    we begin to talk about near infrared, hyperspectral index linked to water content,
    Internet of Things (IoT), UAV, Agricultural Robot, Machine learning and Lora-Technologies.
    This shows a significant increase in the interest regarding this topic in recent
    years. The low number of publications in 2023 is due to the research including
    only the first two months of the year were considered. Therefore, the number is
    underestimated and will grow over time probably following the same pattern. Also,
    the number of publications in 2022 is underestimated because the articles are
    inserted until June of the same year because of the impact factor. Considering
    the authors’ countries affiliation, Table 2 reported the top 10 countries. In
    Table 2 it is possible to observe how the top countries are India, followed by
    the USA and China. As for the EU countries, there are Italy and Spain. Then Brazil,
    Australia, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Malaysia. In the work of Pallottino et al.
    [27] which has a range of publications between 2000 and 2016 the three top countries
    are USA, China and Germany. In contrast, in this work focused on precision irrigation
    the top country is India which probably for climate problems gives a huge contribution
    due to 400 occurences of publications by Indian authors. Regarding EU countries
    in this work there is no Germany but there is Italy and Spain which are important
    countries from an agricultural point of view. In the work of Pallottino et al.
    [27] they are at point 5 and 8 while in this work they are above Germany which
    does not appear among the top 10 top countries. Probably, Italy and Spain appear
    in the top 10 top countries for climate reasons. Other countries that invest in
    research for climate reasons and appear among the top 10 countries are Brazil,
    Australia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Malaysia [27]. 3.2. Cluster of research The
    visual analytics of the corresponding clusters, node by clusters on the authors’
    keywords reported by CiteSpace software was reported in Fig. 2. In this Figure
    keywords were connected by forming groups, each one corresponding to a specific
    homogeneous theme. Connecting the themes is the basis for linking the keywords
    together. The process of keyword synthesis and theme identification represents
    cluster analysis [28]. Download : Download high-res image (290KB) Download : Download

    As shown in Fig. 2, 10 clusters were extracted numbered #0 to #10; the smaller
    the number, the more literature was included. Based on the clustering themes,
    the research on precision irrigation (2001–2023) was divided into two phases of
    the time series. The clusters were presented in the following form: cluster label
    and size of the cluster. The highest-ranking clusters (i.e., #0, i.e., the most
    numerous) are represented in the middle part compared with the lowest ranking
    clusters (i.e., #10). As observed in Fig. 3, starting with the highest cluster,
    cluster #0 is about using internet, cluster #1 is about unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs), cluster #2 is about crop coefficient, cluster #3 is about precision irrigation,
    cluster #4 is about lawn turf, cluster #5 is about irrigation system, cluster
    #6 is about cost-effective, cluster #7 is about using machine vision, cluster
    #8 is about wireless sensors network, cluster #9 is about sprinkler irrigation

    cluster#8 WSN These two clusters will be discussed together because as can be
    seen in Fig. 3, they are also almost overlapping graphically and have strictly
    common themes, because sensors networking is strictly correlated to the Internet
    in precision irrigation. This hypothesis prompted us to discuss together these
    two clusters. One of the way farmers use the Internet for precision irrigation
    is by accessing data from weather stations and other sensors (such as WSNs, which
    are small, low-power sensors that can be placed in a field to collect data on
    soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors). Figorilli et al.
    [29] performed a study using an IoT open-source LoRa (long-range) soil moisture
    device and data analysis in a cultivated area in the municipality of Tenna (Trentino,
    South Tyrol, Italy) The experiment was conducted on two different apple varieties
    during summer 2019. In the study by Farooq et al. [30], a smart gateway equipped
    with WSN sensors was developed to measure water level and flow for open-channel
    precision irrigation. The smart gateway allowed water content to be delivered
    according to crop needs by calculating the amount of water based on fuzzy decisions.
    The mobile dashboard provided real-time information and control to the farmer.
    The system has been tested on a pilot scale and with a MATLAB simulation. The
    rate of moisture decline at different temperatures was tested to predict irrigation
    days. In conclusion, the Internet is a powerful tool for precision irrigation
    because it provides access to real-time data and modeling tools that can help
    farmers optimize water use and improve crop yields. In detail, WSNs enable real-time
    data collection on soil moisture and other environmental factors, can help farmers
    make more informed decisions about when and how much water to apply to crops,
    improving water use efficiency and crop yields. In addition to that a connected
    system can alert the farmer with error messages evidencing in real-time a field
    problem such as a flood, the breakage of a sensor, through the installation of
    flow meters, part of the irrigation system with consequent waste of water and
    potential damage to crops or even problem with the energy supply which means pumps
    not working or an interrupted line. 3.2.2. Cluster #1 unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) Over the past decade, the use of UAVs has enabled many practical applications
    in precision agriculture (PA). The importance of this cluster is demonstrated
    by how these vehicles enable increased agricultural productivity while reducing
    operational costs. UAVs facilitate a range of agricultural activities, including
    scanning soil health, planning irrigation schedules, planting, fertilizer application,
    and analysing weather conditions [31]. As reported by Cheng et al. [32], UAVs
    are inexpensive means to perform accurate estimation of soil moisture content
    (SMC) in the field. UAVs had similar performance to machine learning algorithms
    and were stable for SMC estimates at various depths and even produced a lower
    relative error for deeper (20 cm) estimates. Therefore, this method can be used
    to monitor SMC and support precision irrigation systems with a contained budget.
    The work of Meyan et al. [33] also showed an important help of UAVs equipped with
    sensor technologies for estimating the water status of crops and corn in particular.
    This study aimed to estimate the leaf and canopy water status of inbred corn lines
    using digital and hyperspectral UAV data. The results obtained show that the leaf
    cover extracted directly from digital images acquired by UAV is suitable to replace
    the leaf area index, improving the data availability for canopy water status estimation;
    therefore, the UAV hyperspectral camera, through the application of appropriate
    image analysis techniques, can accurately estimate the water status of inbred
    maize lines. In conclusion, UAVs are a powerful tool for precision irrigation,
    providing farmers with valuable data on crop health, soil moisture and other variables
    that can be used to optimize irrigation practices. As technology advances, it
    is likely that the role of UAVs in precision agriculture will continue to grow.
    Moreover, drone can provide additional benefit to the farm management since normally
    sensors embedded generate info also related to the crop health within the same
    flight economically maximizing the output obtained i.e., for the increasing adoption
    of fertigation and chemigation strategies. Must be added as drone flight can aid,
    not only in discriminating differences and providing watering bulletin, but also
    in detecting potential pooling and leaks in the system giving the ability to intervene
    quickly. 3.2.3. Cluster #2 crop coefficient The culture coefficient (Kc) is a
    key factor in precision irrigation, as it plays a key role in determining the
    amount of water that crops need to grow and thrive. The culture coefficient is
    a dimensionless factor that links the actual water use of a crop to its potential
    water use under ideal growing conditions. By accurately estimating the crop coefficient
    for a particular crop and growing environment, farmers can optimize their irrigation
    practices and achieve maximum crop yield. The way farmers employ the crop coefficient
    in precision irrigation is by using weather station data and other sensors to
    calculate the water needs of their crops site-specifically. Using this data in
    combination with the crop coefficient, farmers can determine the amount of water
    that their crops need to grow and adjust their irrigation programs accordingly.
    Zheng et al. [34] determined the culture coefficient (Kc) of two tea cultivars
    (Camellia sinensis), clone varieties Baiye1 (BY1) and Longjing43 (LJ43), based
    on lysimetric data, through the water balance equation. In addition, the effect
    of tea cultivars and tea pruning practices on tea Kc has been verified. The results
    showed the reliability of Kc in the tea plantation showing differences in plant
    growth on the base of Kc. This provided a solid foundation for precise irrigation
    in tea plantations in the specific subtropical climate. Kc can also be a good
    method in soil salinity. In the study conducted by Ma et al. [35], experiments
    were conducted to study cotton Kc (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under different degrees
    of soil salinization. Three grades of irrigation water were used to irrigate the
    mulched cotton. In addition, the Ks model was used to estimate saline stress under
    real conditions. This could be useful for efficient water management in cotton
    cultivation systems under mulched drip irrigation in arid regions. In conclusion,
    the specific research area represented by Cluster #2 show great potential of Kc
    being this is a critical factor in precision irrigation. The information can be
    acquired both proximally or remotely with the ais of drones for the creation of
    Kc map with temporal and spatial variability, allowing farmers to accurately estimate
    the water needs of their crops and optimize their irrigation practices to achieve
    maximum yield. 3.2.4. Cluster #4 lawn turf Precision irrigation is a valuable
    method of managing the use of water in turf production and maintenance. Indeed
    turf is a popular landscape choice in many regions, but it can be difficult to
    maintain due to its high-water requirements. Precisely to reduce the use of water
    while maintaining from the turf, you can resort to precision irrigation, such
    as drip irrigation and micro-sprinklers. A study conducted by Gu et al. [36] highlighted
    the importance of water conservation in California especially during drought seasons,
    creating an automatic irrigation system in order to minimize water use, but keeping
    the turf green. The study exploited an artificial intelligence algorithm based
    on weather data and induced irrigation models. An application was then created
    to notify the user of the irrigation rate automatically calculated by the algorithm.
    This saves money and minimizes water pollution by preserving water resources in
    dry seasons. One advantage of precision irrigation systems for lawn turf is their
    ability to deliver water directly to the roots of the grass. This can help to
    reduce water waste and improve water-use efficiency. In addition, precision irrigation
    can be customized to match the specific water requirements of different types
    of turfgrass, ensuring that each area among several, receives the appropriate
    amount of water. 3.2.5. Cluster #5 irrigation systems Also in this case, the cluster
    will be described together with cluster #9 because the latter is also a precision
    irrigation hardware and technique included in cluster#5. A key component of precision
    irrigation is the use of advanced irrigation systems that can provide water exactly
    where and when it is needed. There are several types of irrigation systems that
    are commonly used for precision irrigation, including drip irrigation, sprinkler
    irrigation, and central pivot irrigation. Drip irrigation systems are one of the
    most common types of irrigation systems used primarily for automatic irrigation
    in the beginning and now for precision irrigation purposes due to the flexibility
    they present in terms of automation. These systems use a network of small tubes
    and emitters to provide water directly to the plant roots. Drip irrigation systems
    are highly efficient, as they can provide water exactly where it is needed, minimizing
    waste, and maximizing crop yields. As for drip irrigation, AL-agele et al. [37]
    has designed and built a variable speed drip sprinkler that monitors individual
    drops of water. Unlike ordinary drip sprinklers, this sprinkler adjusts the water
    application directly by monitoring the applied volume in contrast to the uniform
    drip irrigation systems that control the water application indirectly by pressure
    compensation and operating time. This can also be used to change the distance
    reached. In this way, this tool is valid energetically going to reduce water consumption
    and related costs. Another type of irrigation that is gradually expanding is sprinkler
    irrigation. This allows the water saving and the increase of the yield showing
    further positive effects also in the precision control of water and fertilizers.
    Sprinkler irrigation systems are another irrigation system commonly used for precision
    agriculture. These systems use a series of sprinklers to provide water over a
    large area. Sprinkler irrigation systems can be highly efficient, when used in
    combination with weather sensors and other advanced technologies that allow farmers
    to adjust their irrigation programs and application rates according to the needs
    of their crops [38]. Satriyo et al. [39] conducted a study on an optimized control
    system developed via the Internet of Things to control the rain irrigation systems
    used for growing shallots. The results showed that controlled rain irrigation
    can optimize all important parameters for the plant, allowing irrigation to be
    carried out according to the desired level of soil moisture. The third type of
    precision irrigation is central pivot irrigation. These systems use a self-propelled
    long arm that rotates around a central point, providing water to crops in a circular
    pattern. Central pivot irrigation system is very popular in United States and
    other countries where big field with flat surface are presents. This system is
    under continuous developments and nowadays can be completely controlled remotely
    via specific app. Is interesting how despite in the past End Gun cam be mounted
    at the end of the pipe which is a large sprinkler used to deliver water directly
    to the corners of the field that cannot be covered by the circular pattern of
    the pivot. Central pin irrigation systems can be highly efficient, especially
    when used in combination with soil moisture sensors and other advanced technologies
    that allow farmers to optimize their irrigation practices. On this topic, Saraiva
    et al. [40] proposed a method to automatically detect and map central pin irrigation
    systems using U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture of image segmentation,
    applied to a constellation of PlanetScope images from the Cerrado biome of Brazil.
    Through the application of the neural network, 99% accuracy and an 88% recall
    were achieved to detect and map central pin irrigation systems in the study area.
    This method was proposed to detect and map central pin irrigation systems but
    has the potential to be scaled to larger areas also to improve and monitor the
    freshwater use by agricultural activities. 3.2.6. Cluster #6 cost-effective design
    This cluster shows, like always happens with technology under development, a step
    in the TRL (Technology Readiness Level). The implementation and use of a technology
    is strictly correlated with its cost in relation to the benefits it directly produces.
    Indeed, precision irrigation is an effective way to optimize the use of water
    in agriculture, but it can also be expensive to implement. However, recent research
    have focused on developing economic projects for precision irrigation systems
    that can provide the same benefits at a lower cost. One of these is the use of
    low-cost sensors and controllers to monitor and adjust irrigation programs based
    on real-time data. A study by Plaščak et al. [19] used pivot systems for data
    collection of soil temperature and surface temperature of the plant for the development
    of automatic irrigation. These systems have been found to be very convenient thanks
    to the low cost and ease of use even for small farmers. As reported by Iqbal et
    al. [41] ground moisture sensors were built using brass, copper and steel, in
    order to improve water productivity through a precision irrigation application.
    The cost of manufacturing these sensors was 10 times lower than that of imported
    sensors. Therefore, the results of the study showed that moisture sensors made
    of steel are accurate and allow monitoring of soil moisture in real time to promote
    precision irrigation and are low-cost tools which represent a big plus since often
    sensors need to be replaced. Zhang et al. [42] ‘s work was also conducted on the
    Internet of Things (IoT) system to monitor real-time data from sensors and automate
    irrigation systems. In detail, a low-cost and easily implementable IoT system
    was used that can be used for precision crop irrigation (LoRaWAN). The system
    has had advantages related to energy consumption, communication, sensor reading
    and valve control and is implemented for precision and automatic irrigation operations
    for horticultural crops improving crop water efficiency and being cost-effective
    due to the low-cost technology in use. In conclusion, precision irrigation technologies
    are following a trend towards a reduction of the costs of the hardware and therefore
    in line with the needs of companies and farmers who need effective tools available
    at an appropriate price. In addition, there are also open-source software that
    can be used to avoid the payment of services subscriptions. 3.2.7. Cluster #7
    using machine vision This cluster focuses on data analysis. Machine vision technology
    has the potential to revolutionize precision irrigation by providing data elaborated,
    also in real-time, on plant water stress and enabling precise water delivery.
    In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the use of artificial vision
    for precision irrigation, showing very promising results [2]. In the work of Gumiere
    et al. [2] the matrix potential of a soil cultivated with cranberries has been
    monitored through a model based on machine learning comparing it with a deterministic
    model based on physics. The results showed that although both models can accurately
    predict the potential of the soil matrix in the root zone, the machine learning
    model certainly has better performance. Blasi et al. [43] has conducted work to
    provide water irrigation scheduling using artificial intelligence (machine learning)
    to detect soil humidity and temperature by means of sensors that inhibit automatic
    irrigation following the humidity level. The intelligent automatic irrigation
    system model was built using the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm, which is a machine
    learning algorithm. The model showed a predictive accuracy of 97.86%, showing
    a good potential for irrigation scheduling in agriculture. Another Machine Learning
    approach was applied by Tschand [44]. In this work was built an IoT irrigation
    network for African territories. Then, was applied a semi-supervised model used
    to train a two-way recurring neural network. Model tests had a precision percentage
    of 89.1% and a binary classification success of 96.0%. The neural network reduced
    the negative impact of water scarcity on agricultural yields. In conclusion, machine
    vision technology has the potential to greatly improve precision irrigation by
    providing real-time data on plant water stress, health and growth, but can also
    be used for other scope i.e., pests detection. Using machine vision, farmers can
    optimize water use and increase harvests, improving profitability and sustainability.
    3.2.8. Cluster #10 energy saving Probably in line with the emerging problems worldwide,
    energy increasing demand and war just to cite some of them, this Cluster acquired
    importance over the last years. Indeed, the last cluster deals with the main topic
    of precision irrigation, namely Energy saving. This is important because pumping
    and water distribution can be energy intensive processes. There are several ways
    to reduce energy consumption in precision irrigation, such as optimizing system
    design, using efficient irrigation technologies, and using renewable energy sources
    [28]. As reported by Liu et al. [28], optimizing system design can help reduce
    energy consumption in precision irrigation. The work reported that by using smaller
    tubes, friction losses are reduced, and elevation changes minimized. This can
    help reduce pumping requirement and energy consumption. In addition, the use of
    efficient irrigation technologies such as drip irrigation and micro-sprinklers
    can also help reduce energy consumption by reducing water losses and improving
    water use efficiency. Another way to reduce energy consumption in precision irrigation
    is to use renewable energy sources such as solar energy. Overall, energy saving
    is a fundamental consideration in precision irrigation, and there are several
    ways to reduce energy usage while still maintaining effective irrigation practices.
    By optimizing system design, using efficient irrigation technologies, and incorporating
    renewable energy sources, it is possible to achieve both water and energy savings
    in precision irrigation systems. 3.3. Analysis of top 20 keywords in strength
    To better represent the central keywords, we have extracted the top 20 key words
    by diffusion force (Fig. 4). In terms of burst strength, the emergence of the
    frontier of research is likely to lead to an explosion of its keywords in a short
    time, with the result that the frontier evolves into the next hot topic or disappears
    and then we can get an idea of the evolution of research topics in the field from
    burst analysis [28]. Download : Download high-res image (647KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. CiteSpace analysis of keywords within items mentioned
    in search articles retrieved from the query. The color bars on the right represent
    the following period bands. Red: burst in the use of the term; dark blue-green:
    the term was used below the threshold of burst; pale blue-green: the term was
    not used. \" Begins\" and \"Ends\" represent the time interval (i.e., \"Year\")
    in which each term has been used. The bursting period of the term is between 2001
    and 2023. There are terms that in some periods have never been used. The red bar
    is the most indicative of the use of the term and its exploding period. It can
    be observed that in the last years and therefore starting from 2021 there has
    been an explosion of some terms that are absent in the first years of research.
    These keywords are “smart agriculture”, “internet of things”, “learning algorithm”
    and “deep learning”. These words exploded in 2021 and are still in use. Probably,
    this indicates that the theme of precision irrigation via IoT sensors and deep
    learning is expanding compared to traditional methods that are no longer mentioned
    in publications in recent years. In fact, some words such as “central pivot”,
    “control system” and “artificial vision” have ended their explosion already for
    some years, leaving room for technological innovation. As shown in Fig. 1, the
    number of publications remains quite constant between 2001 and 2016 with slight
    increases, while since 2017 a drastic increase could be observed. This trend is
    closely related to that shown in Fig. 3. In fact, in Fig. 3 in recent years the
    most popular words are those related to the implementation of robotics and AI
    technologies. In fact, recently, the traditional precision irrigation techniques
    popular until 2014 are giving way to modern IoT and Machine learning techniques.
    For example, one study that highlights the importance of irrigation systems in
    precision agriculture using sensors is the research conducted by El Chami et al.
    [45]. In their study, was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost wireless
    soil moisture sensor in order to determine the level of irrigation to optimize
    marketable yield, fruit quality and economic profit for tomatoes. 3.3.1. Artificial
    intelligence - AI In precision irrigation, AI is an approach that relies on machine
    learning algorithms to analyze large sets of environmental and plant growth data
    to identify models and relationships that can be used to predict irrigation strategies
    optimal [46]. The raising of AI is due to both, the development of new algorithm,
    and the strong increase of computational power achieved by computers. For example,
    Zhang et al. [46] used machine learning to develop a model for providing optimal
    irrigation programs for tomato crops in greenhouses based on environmental variables
    such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. The model was found to significantly
    improve crop yield and reduce water consumption compared to traditional irrigation
    methods. Another approach to precision irrigation via AI is based on decision
    support systems (DSS), which provide real-time recommendations for irrigation
    management based on data from sensors and other sources [47]. For example, Katz
    et al. [47] has developed a DSS for precision irrigation of peach orchards, using
    data from soil moisture sensors, weather stations and satellite images to provide
    recommendations for programming and watering amount. The system was found to significantly
    improve water usage efficiency and crop yield compared to traditional irrigation
    methods. The results showed that the IP was within the operating water status
    range of 15 MC, so excess irrigation was applied to the orchard. AI models, in
    addition to machine learning and DSS approaches, have also been used to predict
    demand for crop water based on plant growth phase and other factors. Among the
    different machine learning techniques that can be used in precision irrigation
    are regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks. These techniques
    can be used to predict crop water needs, to optimize irrigation planning and to
    predict crop yields. Thus, AI in precision irrigation offers several advantages,
    including [38]: • Improved crop yield: machine learning models can optimize the
    amount and timing of irrigation, which can lead to better crop yield. • Efficient
    water use: Machine learning models can help reduce water waste by optimizing the
    amount of water used for irrigation. • Reduced costs: Efficient use of water can
    reduce irrigation costs. • Environmental benefits: Efficient use of water can
    help reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by reducing water waste and
    preserving water resources. Because of all these advantages, it can be argued
    that machine learning is a powerful technology that can be used to improve precision
    irrigation systems that will lead to more sustainable farming practices for the
    benefit of both farmers and the environment [38]. As reported by Figorilli et
    al. [29] supervised adaptive predictive models can be used for optimization and
    management of precision irrigation agricultural practices, based on data obtained
    through sensors. They are called adaptive because they are self-learning as new
    data are acquired, updating the model over time. The main model employed is based
    on the TimeLag/TimeSeries concept, which accounts for the time interval between
    water supply and soil moisture data by employing cross-correlation analysis. Through
    these models, decisions are made, which in the context of precision irrigation
    is to suggest proper water supply to keep the crop always in the optimal range
    without wasting water-soluble fertilizer and/or energy. In the consortium over
    the course of the 78 days during the dry season, a total saving of 255 mm of irrigated
    water and 44,000 kW of electricity was produced, equal to 10.82%. 3.3.2. Internet
    of things (IoT) In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a widely used
    approach in precision irrigation, especially for observing various information
    related to soil humidity and temperature and weather conditions. The IoT uses
    low-power wireless technologies, inexpensive devices, and cloud data centers for
    storage [48]. The advantage of IoT irrigation systems lies in the fact that they
    can be used even when farmers do not have much economic resources. In fact, these
    are mostly low-cost sensors and controllers that can be used by anyone [49]. The
    type of sensors used when there is a shortage of water are those designed to be
    operated remotely exploiting IoT ecosystems. They take precise measures for planning
    irrigation, considering parameters such as water quantity, temperature, and humidity
    [29]. Currently, technologies defined as IoT are radio frequency identification
    devices (RFID), lorawan, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and other
    wireless communication technologies [50]. There are several works in the literature
    on the use of IoT technologies in precision irrigation. In the work of King et
    al. [51] an IoT system was developed, consisting of several sensors in order to
    monitor the real-time weather conditions, the temperature of the crown of the
    vine, the soil moisture and the amount of irrigation. Roy et al. [52] has developed
    an IoT irrigation planning system for efficient water management in farmland.
    This low-cost sensor is easy to use and results in a 10.21% increase in crop productivity
    compared to traditional manual irrigation methods. In the study of Abioye et al.
    [50] an IoT system was created to monitor irrigation for the cultivation of the
    Mustard Leaff plant showing an excellent method to monitor the volumetric content
    of water in the soil. Thanks to the controller you will have an optimal control
    action for better water saving, reduced energy consumption and higher yields.
    In general, the IoT defines itself as an extension of the Internet to all devices
    that can communicate with electronic equipment and are connected to the Internet
    and for this it is easy to use and manage. The use of IoT sensors is a valuable
    aid for farmers who can better understand crops, reducing environmental impact
    and conserving resources, using fewer resources, such as fertilizers, water and
    seeds [53]. 4. Conclusions In conclusion, the present work showed a panorama that
    underline the potential of precision irrigation to tell farmers where and how
    much to water underlining the deriving benefits. Precision irrigation has emerged
    as a promising solution for sustainable agriculture by improving water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. With the help of advanced technologies, such as sensors,
    machine learning, and data analytics, precision irrigation systems can provide
    accurate information about soil moisture levels, plant water requirements, and
    weather conditions. By using this information to deliver water precisely where
    and when it is needed, farmers can reduce water wastage, save energy costs, and
    increase yields. Souza and Rodrigues (2022) found that through the use of precision
    irrigation it is possible to reach energy savings potentials of up to 4,8% while
    the average potential for raised profitability using precision irrigation equal
    to 16.4%. Precision irrigation not only benefits farmers but also contributes
    to the conservation of water resources and the protection of the environment.
    As precision irrigation technologies continue to advance, it is expected that
    they will play an increasingly critical role in ensuring food security and addressing
    water scarcity challenges in many regions of the world. In this regard, it was
    surprising to see that no specific clusters regarding water consumption, water
    resources depletion and irrigation efficiency were identified by the bibliometric
    analysis. Precision irrigation has already gained significant traction in regions
    with limited water resources, advanced technology and knowledge availability or
    facing frequent droughts, such as the Middle East, America, Australia, and parts
    of Africa. However, there is still a long way to go before precision irrigation
    becomes a mainstream solution for agriculture globally. The high initial investment
    cost and technical complexity of precision irrigation systems pose a barrier for
    many small-scale farmers. Thus, governments and other stakeholders must work towards
    creating incentives and programs that support the adoption of precision irrigation.
    Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in compliance with Water framework Directive
    (WFD) and Farm to Fork Strategy, promote agriculture and precision irrigation
    as sustainable agronomic practices able for contributing to society''s needs in
    terms of nutrition and health. Furthermore, when providing investment support,
    Member States are required to pay particular attention to the cross-cutting objective
    of modernizing agriculture, promoting innovation and digitalisation in agriculture
    and rural areas. Support for the modernization and development of irrigation infrastructure
    is permitted only where it does not compromise the good quality status of the
    water. Italian CAP Strategic Plan identifies adaptation to climate change and
    rationalization of the use of water for irrigation purposes as one of the priority
    objectives to be pursued, in compliance with the territorial needs and the environmental
    objectives defined at River Basin District level. Therefore, it provides both
    support to investments in more efficient irrigation systems (through investment
    measures) and the adoption (through agro-environmental-climate measures) of agricultural
    practices and Decision Support Systems (DSS), to rationalize the use of fertilizers,
    plant protection products and water, allowing an efficient use of resources and
    the reduction of pollution. Even in the context of Italian Recovery and Resilience
    Plan, under the Next Generation EU, investments for innovation and the digitization
    of irrigation are envisaged. In particular, the investment program for Innovation
    and mechanization in the agricultural and food sector, in charge of Italian Ministry
    of Agriculture, finances the implementation of smart technologies for irrigation
    and water management on farms. Additionally, continuous research and development
    are crucial for improving the efficiency and affordability of precision irrigation
    systems. By addressing these challenges, we can unlock the full potential of precision
    irrigation in sustainable agriculture and ensure a more resilient and food-secure
    future for all. Ethics statement Not applicable: This manuscript does not include

    water management 1. Introduction The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
    (FAO) has projected that the world’s population will reach 9 billion by 2050,
    boosting agricultural demand by 50 percent compared with 2013 [1]. Moreover, the
    situation is aggravated by the negative impact of climate change, which contributes
    to an increase in extreme weather events causing disastrous impact on worldwide
    agriculture and more commonly to food security of developing nations [2,3]. In
    addition, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 created more uncertainties in the agricultural
    system and risks to global food security. Therefore, food production systems shall
    be governed by sustainable management of agricultural lands in order to reduce
    or end the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture, land degradation,
    water and energy resources, and biodiversity [4]. Agriculture, along with its
    allied sectors, is the largest source of livelihood in India. Approximately 80%
    of the population depend on agriculture or its by-products as the primary means
    of employment. Considering the rapid growth of the population, it is imperative
    for government policymakers to promote smart farming to make agriculture sustainable
    and profitable. Thus, it is essential to accelerate the integration innovative
    technologies to enhance the agricultural sector, especially in developing countries
    like India [5]. Traditionally in India, crop estimation and health status was
    monitored through crop cutting and manual observations. Based on this, farmers
    apply pesticides, herbicides, fertilizer, and irrigation to their farms for enhancing
    crop production. However, this process is both time consuming and resource intensive,
    leading to an increased input costs in agriculture. In light of overcoming this
    pressing issue, there is an urgent need for real-time crop growth monitoring across
    diverse locations and under varying environmental conditions. Real-time crop monitoring
    not only saves time and improves management techniques, but it also enables managers
    to effectively respond to extreme climatic events and minimize their impact on
    the global food system [6]. Remote sensing (RS) is an essential tool for meeting
    the aforementioned needs, as it offers a non-destructive method for acquiring
    information across local to global scales. It has proven to be a powerful tool
    to obtain significant volumes of crop data in a short time and generating valuable
    information for crop managers [7]. RS allows for the characterization of spatiotemporal
    variability within a given area. In recent times, our capacity to obtain remote
    sensing data has undergone remarkable advancements, ushering into an era that
    characterized by the proliferation of large datasets—commonly referred to as “big
    data”. Big data not only encompasses the voluminous data but also challenges arising
    from its rapid generation, diversity, reliability and inherent value, often encapsulated
    as 5Vs. The conventional processing techniques are incapable of meeting the constantly
    growing demands in the era of smart agriculture. To that end, the machine learning
    (ML) has emerged as a powerful technique for efficiently extracting information
    from diverse information sources. Numerous comprehensive reviews focus on the
    use of ML algorithms for agriculture management at the global level [8,9,10,11].
    Chlingaryan et al. (2018) reviewed the use of ML algorithms for crop yield and
    nitrogen status prediction [8]. Liakos et al. included a few contributions from
    RS tools at the global level [9]. Furthermore, Jha et al. analyzed the automation
    techniques applied to agriculture systems [10]. The work of Diaz-Gonzalez et al.
    (2022) included both ML and RS techniques but only to review the studies focused
    on soil quality assessment at the global level. All the above-mentioned reviews
    were focused on research studies executed at the global level [11]. Therefore,
    this review aims to discuss RS and ML applications in solving problems related
    to agriculture in India. Usage of advanced technology in Indian agriculture also
    gain momentum at the policy level. The Committee on Doubling Farmer’s Income (DFI)
    formulated the National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGPA), which is focused
    on agriculture management through advanced technology viz. remote sensing, machine
    learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, drones, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    sensors, data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain (https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1697526
    (18 July 2023). In the present study, we want to highlight the RS satellites and
    ML techniques used in the agricultural domain. We also summarize the challenges
    and future scope of linking ML technology to RS data for Indian agriculture based
    on the searched articles. Consequently, this study can serve as an extensive foundation
    for future research. In this regard, we conducted a systematic literature review
    (SLR) by applying a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
    (PRISMA) protocol. We selected 54 articles that dealt with the use of ML and RS
    data in agriculture in India. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section
    1 is the introduction; Section 2 deals with the theoretical background of AI/ML
    techniques/algorithms, RS applications in agriculture, and leveraging ML techniques
    on RS data for agricultural applications; Section 3 contains the methodology used
    to collect the relevant papers for the study; Section 4 explains the findings
    obtained from the analysis of the selected research articles; and Section 5 discusses
    and concludes the implications of the study. 2. Background In this section, we
    explain the basic concepts of ML and RS. Furthermore, we explain the role of ML
    and RS in solving agricultural problems in separate sections. 2.1. Machine Learning
    Machine learning (ML) is a sub-branch of AI and part of data science that principally
    focuses on learning systems and algorithm theory, performance, and properties.
    It is an an intelligent tool which has strong bearing on AI, statistics, engineering,
    mathematics, information theory, cognitive science, and many other scientific
    and technological disciplines [12]. In general, the goal of ML is to optimize
    the performance of a task using past experiences. ML can establish efficient relationships
    between data inputs based on the past experiences and can effectively analyze
    large volume of data [13]. It involves the process of creating mathematical models
    on sample data sets called “training datasets” to make decisions and predictions
    [14]. The algorithm or model first trained and then classified/predicted with
    a ML technique. The validity of the ML model is general tested using the “testing
    dataset”, which is further used to improve the model and perform accurate classification/prediction
    (Figure 1). Figure 1. General architecture of the ML model. The ML algorithm is
    classified into three main techniques depending on the nature of the feedback
    available for a learning system, which are unsupervised learning (UL), supervised
    learning (SL), and reinforced learning (RL) [9] (Table 1). Table 1. Different
    ML techniques. UL and SL are mainly focused on data analysis, whereas RL is mainly
    focused on solving the decision-making problems. Table 2 presents a comparison
    between different ML techniques according to the definitions provided by Liakos
    et al. [9]. Due to the numerous abbreviations used in the relative scientific
    works, Table 3 list the abbreviations referenced in this study. Table 2. Types
    of ML models used in this review. Table 3. List of ML-based abbreviations used
    in the study along with their full forms. To evaluate the performance of ML algorithms,
    statistical metrics are utilized [13]. 2.2. Performance Metrics Commonly Used
    in Reviewed Studies In this section, we provide a brief description of the performance
    metrics commonly used in the reviewed papers. These metrics are crucial in evaluating
    ML algorithms, as they offer a standardized way to measure their performance.
    The performance metrics used in the reviewed studies for regression problems are
    root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE), and mean squared error (MSE). The equation of the abovementioned
    metrics are as follows [13,15,16]: R2 = [n ∑ (YA × YP) − ∑ (YA) ∑ (YP)]/[ (n ∑
    YA2 − (∑ YA)2) (n ∑ YP2 − (∑ YP)2)]0.5 RMSE = (1/n ∑ (YA − YP)2)0.5 MAPE = 1/n
    ∑ |(YA − YP)/YA| MSE = 1/n ∑ (YA − YP)2 where n is the sample size, YA is the
    actual/observed value, and YP is the predicted value. In classification problems,
    to evaluate the model error, a confusion matrix is the most commonly used measure.
    Let us consider a binary crop classification example where we want to classify
    crops as “maize” and “wheat” (Table 4). Table 4. Representative illustration of
    a binary confusion matrix. True positive (TP): wheat correctly predicted as wheat,
    true negative (TN): maize correctly predicted as maize, false positive (FP): maize
    incorrectly predicted as wheat, and false negative (FN): wheat incorrectly predicted
    as maize. The aforementioned values derived from Table 5 can be implemented to
    estimate the performance metrics typically observed in classification problems
    [17]. Table 5. Summary of the performance metrics used in the reviewed studies,
    typically for classification problems. ML has been used effectively to solve different
    agriculture problems in crop management comprised of yield monitoring, crop identification,
    disease detection, and crop protection from animal intrusion; in water management;
    in soil management; and in drought monitoring [9,13,18]. 2.3. Remote Sensing and
    Its Application in Agriculture Remote sensing involves acquiring information about
    an object, area, and phenomenon from a distance using instruments and sensors
    mounted on a platform such as a satellite, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV). The sensor measures the electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected
    by the object/area under interest. The quality of information retrieved using
    remote sensing technology depends on the specific features of the sensor/instrument,
    which define the spatial resolution, spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio,
    and revisit frequency of the platform [19]. The use of RS in agriculture dates
    back to 1972, when the first successful launch of LandSat Multispectral Scanner
    System (MSS) satellite occurred. Bauer and Cipra classified Midwestern US agricultural
    landscapes into corn and soyabean fields using a LandSat MSS dataset [20]. RS
    is a non-destructive method of data acquisition, making it an inevitable tool
    to meet multiple goals in agriculture, such as monitoring crop production to feed
    a growing population, choosing economically viable activities, and reducing negative
    environmental impacts such as contributing to climate mitigation and minimizing
    resource depletion [19]. RS technologies serve as a diagnostic tool that can act
    as an early warning system, allowing the agricultural community to counter potential
    problems before they can negatively impact crop productivity. According to the
    Index DataBase (IDB), there are a total of 519 indexes used particularly for RS
    application in agriculture [21]. The most widely used VI is the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), which analyzes a near infrared (NIR) band centered at
    850 nm and a red band centered at 680 nm [22]. Table 6 shows the RS-derived variables
    that are identified in this review. Table 6. List of the RS-derived variables
    used in the review. 2.4. Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques on Remote Sensing
    for Agricultural Applications Agricultural monitoring using RS is a wide area
    of research that has been thoroughly explored from multiple perspectives, based
    on RS platforms (satellites, UAV, aircrafts), on specific applications (yield
    prediction, irrigation, crop stress detection and management, weed detection,
    irrigation management, etc.), and diverse climatic and location contexts (ranging
    from field scale to global scale, on wetlands or drylands). India has achieved
    notable success in utilizing RS technology for agriculture applications in crop
    acreage estimation, yield prediction, crop identification and mapping, crop stress
    evaluation, and crop protection with a strong expansion on national expansion.
    There has been a significant increase in published literature related to RS applications
    in agriculture in India, indicating that the RS for agriculture has reached a
    certain level of knowledge in the country. (Figure 2). This also reflects the
    substantial progress made in RS technology, including high-resolution satellite
    dataset (e.g., Sentinel) and the deployment of cloud computing and ML technology.
    Figure 2. Google Scholar search results. Number of publications, including the
    keywords: remote sensing, agriculture, and India from 2010 to 2021. The RS research
    community is currently facing the era of “big data”, where the utilization of
    ML and deep learning (DL) algorithms is growing for agricultural applications
    [23] through: (i) establishing complex relationships to retrieve RS variables
    from RS data [24,25] and (ii) solving complex classification/prediction problems.
    ML technology has been in routine use for the analysis of RS data for some time.
    One of the applications is classification with RS data (LANDSAT), often using
    an RF and an SVM technique. The utilization of ML technology for the effective
    prediction and classification from RS imagery has been reviewed previously and
    focused on SVM, NN, DT, RF, and k-NN [26,27]. Advanced ML algorithms such as SVM
    [26], RF [28], Gaussian processes, and neural networks [29,30] have been widely
    utilized to retrieve agricultural variables from RS data. These approaches allow
    the complex relationship between variables to be statistically characterized and
    permits real-time computations, which is of strong interest for agricultural applications.
    Most phenotypic studies concerned with multispectral cameras use ML algorithms
    to develop the relationship between vegetation indices and crop traits such as
    leaf area index (LAI), nitrogen content, and chlorophyll content [31]. ML techniques
    are also an efficient way to merge datasets of different natures, such as integrating
    in-situ data (soil data, farming management practice data from field surveys,
    weather variables) with datasets from various RS sources [32]. These technological
    advancements will definitely allow the long-lasting goals for RS applications
    in agriculture to be met. 3. Methodology Systematic Literature Review In this
    review article, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using the Preferred
    Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method. Our
    aim was to identify studies related to the application of ML with remote sensing
    for agriculture management. The PRISMA method includes 4 stages, namely, identification,
    screening, eligibility, and inclusion [33]. This review article stems mainly from
    three research questions: (1) Which agricultural-related issues are solved by
    linking ML techniques and RS datasets, particularly in India? (2) What are the
    principal ML algorithms and RS datasets used to analyze the data? (3) What is
    the progress and future scope of ML and RS to manage agriculture in India? We
    searched for relevant studies in seven databases, including Web of Science, IEEE,
    MDPI, Springer, Scopus, and Google Scholar for the literature search, with keywords
    namely, “machine learning”, “remote sensing”, and “agriculture”, in conjunction
    with “crop yield estimation”, “crop classification”, “disease prediction”, “water
    management”, “drought monitoring”, and “soil management”. We looked for these
    keywords in the article title, abstract, and keywords. Moreover, we considered
    research articles and conferences in English only from India published from 2015
    to 2022. Thus, non-English studies, review articles, preprints, chapters, and
    master’s and doctoral dissertations/theses were excluded. Overall, we identified
    54 relevant papers and selected them based on the PRISMA guidelines, as shown
    through the flowchart in Figure 3. We also considered the exclusive criteria similar
    to recent review studies such as [13,18] during the selection process. Figure
    3. Flowchart of the methodology of the present systematic review based on the
    PRISMA guidelines. 4. Results The selected studies were classified into three
    primary categories, namely, crop management, water management, and soil management.
    The studies under the crop management category further divided into four sub-categories,
    namely, crop classification, yield prediction, disease/pest detection, and weed
    detection. The articles presented here cover the period from 2015 to 2022. 4.1.
    Crop Management 4.1.1. Crop Classification Crop classification is one of the most
    important agricultural applications of RS. The knowledge of the crop type present
    in the field is important for devising and implementing agricultural policies
    [34], consequently leading to efficient crop management and ensuring food security
    [35]. It is worth noting that RS not only enables crop discrimination but also
    allows for the determination of the crop’s development stage. Accurate monitoring
    of heterogeneous agricultural plots is complex, but it is the foremost step towards
    monitoring smallholder cultivators’ farms. This is even more pertinent in Indian
    agriculture since small and marginal farmers together cultivate about 86% of all
    operational landholdings in the country [36], and subsequently improving their
    economic status can further help to meet the Sustainable Development Goals [37].
    RS techniques have improved the effectiveness of crop classification at various
    scales using optical (Landsat series, Sentinel 2 series, ResourceSat-2 series),
    microwave (Sentinel 1, RADARSAT), and hyperspectral data (Hyperion) [38,39]. Indian
    agriculture heavily relies on monsoons, and the Kharif (rainy) season, occurring
    from June to September, is crucial for crops such as rice, maize, cotton, and
    pulses. During cloudy weather, optical datasets are unavailable. Therefore, microwave
    data have been instrumental in overcoming the inherent limitation of optical data.
    Out of the total studies included in the sub-category of crop classification (Table
    7), maximum studies were based on optical dataset [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50],
    while six studies [51,52,53,54,55,56] utilized the capability of both optical
    and microwave remote sensing to classify crops, particularly during Kharif season.
    Refs. [57,58,59,60] used Sentinel 1 and RADARSAT data for crop classification.
    Ranjan and Parida demonstrated the overall accuracy of LULC classes (forest, paddy,
    and other) from Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2B with an overall accuracy of 90 and
    91%, respectively. Nevertheless, the optical data were more appropriate for LULC
    classification using RF, but Sentinel 1 A data were more useful for capturing
    paddy crops [52]. Only two studies were conducted using hyperspectral remote sensing
    [61,62]. Hyperspectral remote sensing data offer distinct advantages over multispectral
    data in identifying and discriminating target features or objects. The narrowband
    information acquisition in hyperspectral data provides detailed and comprehensive
    information about any object [63]. Remote sensing (RS) provides vast amounts of
    information collected globally by various satellite sensors. The availability
    of open-access datasets and rapid sensor technology advancements has expanded
    RS-based studies [64,65]. The challenge has shifted from a lack of information
    to the difficulty of analyzing this large volume of data, often referred to as
    “big data” [66]. Big data is characterized by its volume, variety, velocity, veracity
    and value [67]. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to analyze big
    data and deliver more accurate predictive information. One such tool is Google
    Earth Engine (GEE), which enables spectral and spatial analyses on batches of
    imagery. GEE supports advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms
    through a library of application programming interfaces (APIs) and development
    environments compatible with JavaScript or Python [68]. Gumma et al., in 2020
    and 2022 [49,50], effectively used GEE’s computing capabilities along with the
    random forest (RF) technique to map crop products such as irrigation and rainfed
    crop maps, cropping intensity maps, and crop type maps for South Asia, including
    India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The overall accuracy of each
    product was found to be above 70%. Table 7. Crop classification using RS and ML
    techniques in India.                                           4.1.2. Yield Prediction
    Yield prediction is of high importance for yield mapping and crop management to
    increase the quality and productivity, and subsequently matching crop supply with
    demand. Further, crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in maintaining food
    security. It is of utmost importance in a developing country like India, where
    growing population, heterogeneous agricultural fields, and poor management practices
    impose a range of uncertainties on the yield prediction and hence on crop management.
    The studies evaluated under the yield prediction sub-category are tabulated in
    Table 8. Table 8. Yield prediction using RS and ML techniques in India. The analysis
    of the selected articles indicated that the studies differ with scale (ranging
    from field level to country level), ML algorithm (SVR, ANN, k-NN, GBR), platform
    (Sentinel, MODIS, LANDSAT), and crop (rice, wheat, sugarcane, arhar/tur). LANDSAT-8
    satellite data with 30-meter resolution were effectively utilized for regional
    yield forecasting [69,70,71,72,73], followed by the images retrieved from MODIS
    [74,75,76]. Wolanin et al. conducted wheat yield prediction in the Indo Gangetic
    Plains. The authors utilized CNN, RF and RR, and ML algorithms to predict wheat
    yield and found CNN to be the best model for wheat yield prediction, with an NSE
    of 0.868 [71]. Coarse-to-medium spatial resolution systems like MODIS and Landsat
    struggle to accurately estimate crop production, as they cannot distinguish small
    individual fields, resulting in mixed pixels influenced by other landscape components.
    However, the operational deployment of the Sentinel-2 satellite systems (2A in
    2015 and 2B in 2017) offers key spectral wavelengths at 10–20 m resolution, a
    short revisit period, and open-access data, enabling more frequent high-resolution
    observations of agricultural fields. This advancement opens new possibilities
    for satellite-based crop production estimation in Indian smallholder systems.
    High resolution optical (Sentinel 2) and microwave (Sentinel 1) dataset was effectively
    utilized for rice yield prediction in Jharkhand [52]. Kurupavathi et al. estimated
    field-scale yield using medium resolution Landsat 8 satellite data with 95% accuracy
    [73]. 4.1.3. Disease and Pest Detection Plant diseases and pests pose significant
    threats to global vegetation [77]. Precisely locating and assessing the extent
    and severity of these occurrences is crucial for guiding plant protection measures.
    Remote sensing serves as a “radiodiagnosis” approach, offering non-contact and
    continuous monitoring of diseases and pests efficiently [78]. The early studies
    and applications of this technique date back to the 1980s, and Nilsson [79] demonstrated
    various applications of remote sensing and image analysis in plant pathology.
    As computer science and sensing technology rapidly advance, a wide spectrum of
    remote sensing data is now employed for detecting diseases and pests. In the work
    of Patil et al. [80], the authors utilized SVM, RF, and ANN algorithms for detection
    of blight in potato. Selvaraj et al. [81] presented a method for identifying five
    major banana diseases, such as Xanthomonas wilt of banana (BXW), Fusarium wilt
    of banana (FWB), black sigatoka (BS), yellow sigatoka (YS), and banana bunchy
    top disease (BBTV), along with the banana corm weevil (BCW) pest class using CNN
    architecture. The two studies in Table 9 [82,83] are dedicated to the detection
    and classification of diseased and healthy rice crops. Ramesh and Vydeki used
    KNN and ANN algorithms to discriminate crops affected by rice blast from the healthy
    rice crop [82]. Shrivastava and Pradhan aimed at the accurate detection of a range
    rice plant diseases, such as bacterial leaf blight, rice blast, and seath blight
    from the healthy rice crop based on digital imagery and SVM algorithm [83]. In
    the literature by Chauhan et al. [84], maize diseases were detected based on digital
    imagery and SVM, DT, NB, KNN, and RF algorithms. Singh et al. utilized the capability
    of both thermal and visual images to quantify the severity of stripe rust in wheat
    crop using SVM and ANN techniques. The performance of SVM was found to be better
    in comparison to ANN [85]. Table 9. Disease prediction using RS and ML techniques
    in India. 4.1.4. Weed Detection Weed detection in crop fields and its management
    poses another significant issue in agriculture. Weeds are the most significant
    threat to crop production, as they induce competition for nutrients, water, and
    sunlight, which are ascertained to the target crop. Weed detection is of high
    importance to sustainable agriculture, as weeds are difficult to detect and discriminate
    from the crops. In this regard, RS sensors in conjunction with ML algorithms can
    lead to the accurate detection of weeds with low cost and without any negative
    impact on the environment. Shorewala et al. estimated weed density and distribution
    using a CNN model with an overall accuracy of 82.13% [86] (Table 10). Table 10.
    Weed detection using RS and ML techniques in India. 4.2. Water Management Water
    is a prime contributing factor to the amount and quality of the developed yields.
    Crop water stress hinders the crop physiological processes. Water management plays
    a significant role in agronomical, hydrological, and climatological balance. It
    is particularly important in those areas where irrigation is a key component to
    attaining the desired crop quality and crop yield. Also, for irrigation management
    and scheduling, one should know the quantity and timings of the water supply,
    which can be determined with a proper spatial evolution of plant water stress
    [87]. This section is based on the detection of two water-based properties that
    can severely affect the growth and development of the crop: (i) drought and (ii)
    water stress. The first three studies in Table 11 [88,89,90] deal with drought
    prediction using satellite-derived variables and different ML algorithms. Dhyani
    et al. and Singh et al. utilized CNN and ANN models for drought detection in Karnataka
    and Maharashtra, respectively [88,89]. In the literature by Prodhan et al., a
    comparison between ML (GBM, RF)- and DL (DFNN)-based models has been made [90].
    The aim of the study was to detect drought in South Asia using different satellite-derived
    variables from different satellite products and ML/DL algorithms. The authors
    evaluated better performance of DFNN for drought detection over South Asia. The
    last three studies in Table 9 were based on the evaluation of water stress in
    rice crop [91,92] and maize crop [93] using hyperspectral remote sensing and UAV
    based imagery, respectively. Table 11. Water management using RS and ML techniques
    in India. 4.3. Soil Management Soil is a heterogeneous natural resource, entailing
    intricate mechanisms that pose challenges in comprehension. Soil properties plays
    a pivotal role in deciphering ecosystem dynamics and their impact on agriculture.
    Thus, accurate estimation of the soil conditions holds the potential for refined
    soil management and consequently enhanced agricultural practices. Nonetheless,
    gauging soil properties typically involves a resource-intensive and time-consuming
    process, prompting the pursuit of a cost-effective and dependable solution. This
    can be realized by leveraging readily available Remote Sensing (RS) datasets in
    conjunction with Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This specific category encompasses
    the application of RS in tandem with ML algorithms to predict agricultural soil
    properties, encompassing aspects like soil nutrients, soil salinity, and soil
    moisture content. The first three studies (referenced as [94,95,96] in Table 12)
    delve into estimating soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK),
    and soil organic carbon (SOC). For instance, Tiwari et al. harnessed hyperspectral
    remote sensing (Hyperion) in tandem with ANN technique to map soil organic carbon
    content [94]. In contrast, Kaur et al. integrated optical remote sensing (Sentinel-2,
    LANDSAT-8), terrain, and climatic data, employing RFR, SVR, and GBR techniques
    to estimate NPK and SOC in the Pune and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra [95].
    Kalambakattu et al., on the other hand, leveraged Landsat 8 and CartoDEM datasets
    to map soil organic carbon and available nitrogen in Himachal Pradesh’s hilly
    terrain [96]. The assessment and mapping of soil moisture play a pivotal role
    in determining irrigation needs in agriculture [97]. Backscattering measurements
    of microwaves from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have demonstrated promise
    in effectively monitoring moisture content. Given Sentinel-1’s (C-band) high temporal
    sampling and operational setup, it has significantly contributed to soil moisture
    monitoring. References [98,99] employed Sentinel 1 data in combination with various
    ML techniques to map soil moisture across diverse regions in India. In contrast,
    Das et al. exclusively utilized optical remote sensing datasets (Sentinel 2 and
    Landsat 8), employing a fusion of ensemble models (RF, Cubist, and GBM) to enhance
    soil moisture mapping accuracy [100]. Rani et al. introduced an innovative technique
    for estimating salt-affected soils, employing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm
    with NDVI data from MODIS, reflectance data from LANDSAT-8, and elevation data
    from ALOS [101]. Similarly, Kalambakattu et al. [102] and Vibhute et al. [103]
    harnessed the potential of the Hyperion dataset and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    algorithm to map soil salinity severity and soil types, respectively. The digital
    soil maps can help farmers and decision makers in utilizing precision information
    for farm-scale decision making leading to increased productivity through optimal
    nutrient use and ecosystem sustainability, ultimately securing food supplies.
    A unique methodology was developed by Kumarapermual et al. [104], to map three
    soil attributes and three soil taxonomical units using suite of 6 ML algorithms
    and 39 environmental covariates derived from RS dataset. The contribution of climate
    and topography was found substantial in digital soil mapping. Table 12. Soil management
    using RS and ML techniques in India. Farmers traditionally base their irrigation
    decisions on experience. Now, advanced technologies allow them to predict crop
    water needs based on weather and soil forecasts, leading to more informed choices.
    The integration of IoT and wireless sensor network technologies for smart agriculture
    application through remote sensing has provided valuable insights into weather,
    soil, and crop conditions throughout the growing season. The platforms lacking
    ML or mathematical based models are less effective. ML proves to be a powerful
    tool, emulating human-like capabilities and exhibiting an inherent commitment
    to enhancing machine intelligence [105,106]. It effectively addresses complex
    issues in irrigation systems, handling multivariable, non-linear, and time-varying
    factors [107]. Therefore, by leveraging massive spatial and temporal data stored
    in cloud or edge-based servers, smart decisions on irrigation management can be
    made using various ML-based models. 5. Conclusions A total number of 54 studies
    were included in this review article. The collection of chosen articles exhibited

    Delving into the content, a notable 38 articles concentrated on the integration
    of Machine Learning (ML) and Remote Sensing (RS) technology for crop management.
    In contrast, 6 articles revolved around water management, while 10 articles centered
    on soil management. This distribution is elucidated further in Figure 4, which
    visually delineates the selected studies’ allocation according to the application
    of RS and ML technology within distinct agricultural domains. Figure 4. Pie chart
    showing classification of the reviewed studies in different agriculture domains.
    The abbreviations in the rectangle form represents the following: CM = crop management,
    WM = water management, SM = soil management; CC = crop classification, YP = yield
    prediction, DD = disease detection, WD = weed detection, DP = drought prediction,
    WS = water stress prediction. Within the category of crop management, most of
    the studies were ascribed to crop classification, followed by crop yield prediction,
    disease detection, and weed identification. Under the soil management category,
    three studies each were allocated to soil nutrient prediction and soil moisture
    mapping. Concurrently, two studies centered on delineating soil salinity severity,
    and a single study focused on classification of soil types. In the water management
    category, three studies were conducted to predict drought in different regions
    of India and three studies were carried out to predict the water stress in different
    crops (rice and maize) using a spectroradiometer and UAV remote sensing technology.
    Throughout these studies, remote sensing technology was used in various forms,
    encompassing optical, microwave, hyperspectral remote sensing, and digital images.
    Based on the analysis of selected studies, a total of 27 studies exclusively based
    on optical remote sensing, whereas 6 studies harnessed the combined prowess of
    both microwave and optical data. On the other hand, 5 studies were exclusively
    based on microwave datasets. Moreover, among the available research, four studies
    aligned with hyperspectral and spectroscopy datasets, while digital imagery emerged
    as the sole avenue in predicting crop diseases. These multifarious remote sensing
    techniques are visually encapsulated in Figure 5, delineating their application
    across the diverse categories and sub-categories used in the study. Figure 5.
    Usage of remote sensing technology within each sub-category. The investigation
    revealed the application of seven prominent categories of Machine Learning (ML)
    models across the selected studies, as detailed in Table 2 and depicted in Figure
    6. Notably, variations within ensemble models (EMs)—such as RF, GBR, and XGB—featured
    prominently, encompassing a total of 31 instances. This prevalence was followed
    by the utilization of support vector models (SVMs), accounting for 28 occurrences,
    and neural networks (NNs) with 23 instances. EMs and SVM-based ML techniques were
    substantially utilized across the domains of crop classification, crop yield prediction,
    and soil management. On the other hand, NNs demonstrated exceptional effectiveness
    in identifying and classifying crop diseases, emerging as a prominent tool across
    all the scrutinized studies. Hence, the analysis underscores the predominant role
    of EMs in the spheres of crop, soil, and water management. Figure 6. Number of
    machine learning algorithms used in each category and sub-category. The preference
    for EMs like RF over NNs is frequently influenced by practical considerations
    concerning data availability, computational resources, model complexity, interpretability,
    and ease of implementation. These factors collectively position the RF model as
    a versatile and pragmatic selection for diverse applications. Leveraging machine
    learning on remote sensing data has widened the scope of evolving farm management
    systems into the real artificial intelligence systems. It can further provide
    a wide arena of smart decision-making with the ultimate aim of improving the quality
    and production of agriculture. Further, the increasing availability of various
    RS-based platforms imaging at varied scales along with a range of ML algorithms
    has the potential to boost even more research and development towards smarter,
    sustainable farming, preserving natural resources and protecting ecosystems. 5.1.
    Progress in Synergy of RS and ML Technologies in India This subsection aims to
    assess the advancements of RS and ML technology in agricultural management within
    India. To achieve this, the studies were initially categorized based on the geographical
    regions where the research was conducted. These research endeavors spanned across
    diverse regions of India, encompassing approximately 60% of the nation’s total
    land area (as illustrated in Figure 7). A discerning observation of the figure
    underscores that a majority of studies were undertaken in Uttar Pradesh (10),
    Maharashtra (9), Andhra Pradesh (4), Karnataka (4), West Bengal (3), Tamil Nadu
    (2), Jharkhand (2). Furthermore, a single study was conducted in each of the following
    states: Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
    and Himachal Pradesh. Notably, one study [72] estimated rice yield across 18 states
    in India, while another pair of studies [59,60] harnessed the prowess of cloud
    computing to classify crops based on irrigation type, crop category, and cultivation
    intensity across South Asia. Curiously, there is a dearth of studies from northeastern
    and Himalayan states, with the exceptions of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.
    This disparity in study distribution can be attributed to the varying levels of
    technological advancement in different states, coupled with the availability of
    suitable agricultural areas for study purposes. Figure 7. Geographical distribution
    of the selected articles from each state to the research field, focusing on remote
    sensing and machine learning applications in agriculture. The distribution of
    selected studies was further assessed on an annual basis, as illustrated in Figure
    8. The trajectory of research from India concerning the confluence of RS and ML
    technologies exhibited substantial variability. As discernible from Figure 8,
    there was no consistent upsurge in studies spanning the years 2015 to 2019. Conversely,
    in 2019, there was a marked surge in the number of selected studies, constituting
    a substantial increase of 20.37%. The culmination of this trend, reaching its
    peak at 27.78%, was observed during the year 2022. The increasing number of published
    studies distinctly highlights the achievement of a particular degree of proficiency
    and competence in RS and ML technologies within India. The widespread adoption
    of these advanced methodologies bodes positively for the achievement of long-standing
    goals connected to sustainable and economically feasible agricultural practices
    across the nation. Figure 8. Bar chart representing the percentage of the selected
    articles from the year 2015 to 2022. 5.2. Digital Transformation: Pathway to Prosperity
    Remote sensing provides robust, efficient, and reliable monitoring of agriculture.
    However, limited attention has been paid to how to adapt it for precision agriculture
    (PA) applications. PA applications require information at a much finer scale;
    there is a significant challenge to adopting methodologies across different scales.
    One exciting solution is to leverage high-resolution UAV technology to fine tune
    the satellite-derived variables in relation to the target crop. Machine learning
    (ML) technology provides a unique opportunity for the development of accurate
    and large-scale prediction [108]. ML algorithms with big data can solve extremely
    complex problems that cannot be solved via simple mathematical models [108]. One
    can use the crop phenotypic information extracted from the UAV technology to derive
    accurate satellite-based crop information at larger scales. Simultaneously, there
    have been significant advances in crop growth modelling using mechanistic models
    [109,110,111,112,113]. These models predict the crop evolution from sowing to
    harvest by utilizing the weather, soil, and crop management information and simulating
    crop phenology, photosynthesis, dynamics of temperature and soil moisture, gas
    exchange between the crop canopy and atmosphere, biomass, and crop yield. Crop
    growth models are difficult to parameterize for large-scale applications, as the
    variability in terms of varieties, soil types, and crop management practices can
    vary hugely. In this regard, the assimilation of remotely sensed crop data with
    a crop simulation model is a promising approach. ML technology has emerged as
    a promising complimentary tool to the commonly used crop simulation modelling.
    Although current ML technology is deterministic, crop simulation models are also
    capable of handling non-experienced scenarios [108]. Machine learning could combine
    the benefits of remote sensing and crop simulation modelling to make reliable
    crop-based predictions. Figure 9 demonstrates the integration of remote sensing,
    machine learning, and crop simulation modelling for agricultural applications.
    Figure 9. Digital transformation in agriculture representing integration of remotely
    sensed data, crop simulation, and machine learning. Figure modified from Jung
    et al. [108]. 5.3. Limitations and Way Forward The agriculture sector in India
    has yet to fully embrace advanced technologies. However, given the challenges
    posed by fast-degrading land, water scarcity, and climate change, it has become
    imperative to adopt modern technologies to ensure rational and efficient agriculture
    management. Although RS and ML techniques offer many advantages, they also have
    limitations. For instance, limited availability of RS data on cloudy days, especially
    the optical data, and the difficulty in real-time monitoring of crops. Additionally,
    the usage of UAV is not very prominent in India yet. With regards to the ML technique,
    the high cost of cognitive solutions in the farming market is a barrier, making
    it essential to provide more affordable options for wider adoption. An open-source
    platform could make these solutions accessible and increase understanding among
    farmers. To manage today’s data accumulation and leverage technological advancements,
    farms need decision support systems (DSSs) tailored to their specific cultivation
    systems. DSSs with advanced algorithms can process vast amounts of data and parameters
    that would be impossible for farmers to handle manually. However, the high infrastructure
    investment costs frequently prevent farmers from adopting these technologies.
    This study highlights the current scenario of remote sensing and machine learning
    technology in the agriculture domain in India. It is imperative to smartly manage
    Indian agriculture to sustain a huge percentage of the Indian population. In this
    regard, leveraging advanced technologies seems to constitute one of our best hopes
    to meet the emerging challenges. The availability of huge datasets, along with
    advanced technologies, can in the future lead to smart farming by adopting the
    decision support systems in relation to diverse cultivation systems in India.
    The integration of sensors, automatic data recording, ML technology, satellite
    datasets, UAV datasets, and decision support systems will provide a framework
    to increase crop production and improve crop quality. ML and RS will definitely
    provide a holistic framework for establishing sustainable agriculture. In this
    regard, it is anticipated that the present systematic review will constitute a
    beneficial guide to governmental policymakers, researchers, developers, and farmers.
    Consequently, this study adds considerable knowledge to the existing literature
    in the form of a comprehensive analysis of advances of ML and RS in Indian agriculture,
    with a holistic overview. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.R.P., S.P.;

    Keywords FertilizationNutrient managementMachine learning 1. Introduction Agriculture
    is the main source of food, income, and employment for developing countries and
    their rural populations, especially in Africa Preethi et al. (2020); Tapsoba et
    al. (2020); Collier and Dercon (2014); Rejeb et al. (2022). Given current population
    growth, pressure on agricultural systems will continue to increase Kamilaris et
    al. (2017); Bharath et al. (2022). Many countries are agrarian and their economies
    are based primarily on agricultural productivity Salami et al. (2010); Livingston
    et al. (2011). African agriculture, for example, is influenced by various factors
    such as climate, geography, water scarcity, spatial variability of soils, and
    policies Aworka et al. (2022); Diao et al. (2010); Olanipekun et al. (2019); Jayne
    et al. (2010). Despite the population explosion and increasing demand in the last
    century, farmers still suffer from large economic losses due to under-fertilization
    Chivenge et al. (2022); Jha et al. (2019). Although the amount and quality of
    experimental data is constantly increasing, researchers are still unable to integrate
    it, analyze it, and make the best decisions possible. Modern agriculture proves
    that the introduction of new technologies has solved many problems that farmers
    have faced in the last decades Liakos et al. (2018); Patrício and Rieder (2018);
    Adnan et al. (2019); Elavarasan et al. (2018); Babaie Sarijaloo et al. (2021).
    Technology transfer centers that promote the adoption of new agricultural management
    practices and the use of sensors, drones, and low-cost satellite imagery for pest
    control and better fertilization should help improve the welfare of smallholder
    farmers Kuijpers and Swinnen (2016); Holzworth et al. (2015). The rise of new
    data-intensive scientific fields has led to this modern agriculture, which now
    generates large amounts of data due to the multitude of sensors deployed in experimental
    fields. Traditional data processing techniques are not up to the ever-increasing
    demands of smart agriculture, making it difficult to extract useful information
    from numerous field experiments and soil tests. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging
    technology that can help discover patterns in large data sets Sarker (2021). This
    technology makes predictions directly from given data Ayodele (2010); Singh et
    al. (2016). ML Algorithms can predict yields using fertilizer rates, genetic data,
    and environmental and land management variables. Advances in machine learning,
    a subfield of artificial intelligence, are benefiting agriculture. The digital
    transformation of agriculture is evolving in parallel with artificial intelligence
    systems in various aspects, optimizing the ever-growing data coming from numerous
    sources, not only in crop disease detection, which has received the most attention
    from data scientists Barbedo (2019). In the area of nutrient management, it is
    possible to integrate and interpolate various pieces of information that have
    never been explored for this purpose before. This improves the overall understanding
    of agricultural systems, including nutrient requirements, and also allows economic
    aspects to be incorporated into decisions. Accurate diagnosis of current crop
    nutritional status and nutrient requirements plays a critical role in overall
    farm management and impacts not only the environment, but also the economic sustainability
    of the farm Goulding et al. (2008); Monaghan et al. (2007); Fairhurst et al. (2007);
    Dhal et al. (2022). Yield loss, under-utilization of natural resources, decline
    in soil organic carbon content (OC), lower carbon use, and other problems can
    be caused by either nutrient excess or deficiency. Accurate diagnosis would benefit
    farmers on many levels, including yields, fertilizer recommendations, and revenue.
    In this paper, we review ML based fertilizer estimation and nutrient status algorithms
    developed in the last decade. Commonalities in this area are identified, weaknesses
    are discussed, and possible solutions and future perspectives are proposed. A
    thorough review of detection and classification approaches was conducted, which
    served as the basis for a detailed assessment of key challenges that remain to
    be addressed. This review is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most
    common machine-learning algorithms, feature selection approaches, and performance
    metrics used in the reviewed work. In Section 3, the most common features for
    nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation studies and the methodology
    for study selection are presented, along with the ML-based algorithms used by
    each approach. Finally, Section 4 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of
    using ML in nutrient management. 2. Machine learning Machine learning is a branch
    of artificial intelligence in which the computer, referred to as a machine, learns
    to perform various tasks automatically Venkataraju et al. (2023). ML combines
    mathematical modeling and complex algorithms to perform tasks by learning from
    existing data. ML has been successfully applied in many fields that require classification,
    prediction, and recommendations Abioye et al. (2022). For example, it provides
    farmers with soil quality monitoring tools and personalized recommendations based
    on experimental and field data. ML uses features extracted from known experimental
    input data to develop models capable of predicting the desired outcome from new
    data. Machine learning can be divided into three main categories supervised learning,
    unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning depending on the desired outcome
    El Allali et al. (2021). In supervised learning, an input is mapped to an output
    based on a training dataset Venkataraju et al. (2023), as shown in Fig. 1. In
    the case of regression, the output is a value, while the output of classification
    is a class. Unlike supervised learning, which is task-oriented, unsupervised learning
    is data-oriented, meaning that the goal is to identify patterns in data sets based
    on a set of features Rainville et al. (2014). One of the most common applications
    of unsupervised learning models is clustering, where data with similar patterns
    are grouped into clusters. Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download

    Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has gained traction in the machine learning world
    as computational power is no longer a hurdle Ahmad et al. (2022); Durai and Shamili
    (2022). DL is used in either supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised environments.
    Unlike the algorithms of classical ML, which often require pre-processing of data,
    Deep Learning can bypass this step and is therefore better suited for unstructured
    data such as images. The data is often used directly, eliminating the human factor
    and automating the feature extraction step. A key advantage of DL is its ability
    to analyze huge unlabeled datasets, making it an invaluable tool for Big Data
    Analytics Najafabadi et al. (2015). 2.1. Machine learning algorithms With advances
    in machine learning algorithms, even the most complicated regression and classification
    problems can now be solved Tesfaye et al. (2021). In addition, many of the algorithms
    are available on a number of open source platforms designed specifically for ML.
    Regression is a part of supervised learning that provides a prediction of an output
    variable as a function of input variables that are usually known and available
    in these subcategories. There are many algorithms used in almost all fields, e.g.,
    linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso),
    logistic regression, and stepwise regression. Many complex algorithms have seen
    the light of day to solve much more complex problems, such as multivariate adaptive
    regression splines. Classification is another important type of supervised learning
    that uses models to predict a discrete label instead of a continuous output. Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) is an algorithm that classifies data instances by constructing
    a linear separation hyperplane John et al. (2020); Karimi et al. (2006). To improve
    classification, SVMs use a kernel function to transform the original feature space
    into a higher-dimensional feature space. Classification, regression, and grouping
    have all been performed with SVMs. SVMs are useful in a variety of applications
    because they overcome the difficulties of overfitting that occur in high-dimensional
    spaces and are based on global optimization. Support Vector Regression, Least
    Squares Support Vector Machine and Successive Projection Algorithm Support Vector
    Machine are the most commonly used SVM algorithms. Decision tree (DT) based algorithms
    use trees to gradually group the dataset into smaller homogeneous subsets (subpopulations)
    while creating an associated tree graph. Each branch of the tree graph displays
    the result of a particular pairwise comparison for a particular attribute, while
    each internal node represents the comparison itself. After following the path
    from root to leaf, the leaf nodes show the final judgment or prediction (expressed
    as a classification rule). The classification and regression trees, the automatic
    chi-square interaction detector, and the iterative dichotomizer are the most common
    learning techniques in this category. The Random Forest algorithm (RF) is also
    widely used and consists of a sequence of decision trees. The result predictions
    are combined for better predictive performance. DT can be either a regression
    algorithm or a classification algorithm and represents many suboptimal solutions.
    Based on a set of decision rules that follow a tree-like architecture, it can
    make recommendations based on classified data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
    are also supervised models commonly used for regression and classification Zupan
    (1994); Zou et al. (2008). ANNs use radial basis function networks, perceptron
    algorithms, and backpropagation to build predictive models Griffel et al. (2022).
    Deep ANNs, also called deep learning (DL) or deep neural networks (DNNs), are
    a relatively new branch of machine learning research that enables computer models
    to represent complex data at multiple levels of abstraction by using numerous
    processing operations Dharani et al. (2021). The Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) is also a well-known Deep Learning algorithm that was first used to classify
    images Wu (2017); Kattenborn et al. (2021). CNN creates an artificial neural network
    that can autonomously learn and make intelligent decisions by automatically extracting
    the most appropriate features from input sequences and layering techniques Al-Ajlan
    and El Allali (2018a); Farooque et al. (2023). One of the most attractive features
    of Deep Learning is that feature extraction is often performed by the model itself.
    DL Models have greatly improved prediction in several fields, including agriculture
    Subeesh et al. (2022); Raouhi et al. (2022); Bedi and Gole (2021); Paymode and
    Malode (2022). 2.2. Feature selection The first step in any ML experiment is to
    extract impactful features from the raw data Chandrashekar and Sahin (2014); Dash
    and Liu (1997). The goal of feature extraction is to find the most informative
    group of features (unique patterns) to improve the effectiveness of the classifier.
    Feature extraction, also called feature engineering, extracts features from the
    original data to achieve accurate classification. Feature extraction is an important
    step in ML as classification performance can decrease if features are not carefully
    selected Kebonye et al. (2022). Feature selection, commonly known as dimensionality
    reduction (DR), is a technique used in supervised and unsupervised learning to
    construct a reduced dimensional representation of a dataset while maintaining
    as much discriminative information as possible. To prevent the implications of
    excessive dimensionality, it is frequently used before building classification
    or regression models. There are many feature selection methods in supervised learning,
    classified into three categories, as shown in Fig. 2. The most commonly used DR
    techniques are principal component analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Regression
    (PLS), and linear discriminate analysis (LDA). However, algorithms based on metaheuristic
    approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) are gaining ground in the field of
    feature selection. Download : Download high-res image (110KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Different approaches to feature selection with examples
    for each type. The goal of feature selection is to extract all useful information
    from the data. The features are then used in the training phase to build the ML
    model. Feature selection chooses the smallest possible subset of features from
    the original set of features to maximize generalizability. Given many independent
    variables, the feature selection function selects a subset of variables on which
    to focus a learning algorithm. The model-based approach considers the correlation
    structure among predictors and assigns a value to each feature indicating how
    useful or important it is for model construction. The performance of the model
    would not be affected if features of little or no importance were eliminated.
    To reduce dimension and select the most acceptable features for classification,
    dimension reduction can be paired with a feature extraction algorithm Al-Ajlan
    and El Allali (2018b). On the other hand, Deep Learning uses an alternative architecture
    that incorporates the process of feature extraction from the data into the learning
    phase LeCun et al. (2015); Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018a). This crucial step has
    a significant impact on the results, as it can improve the performance of the
    model by removing unnecessary and redundant features. The model becomes less complicated
    and the likelihood of bias and error is decreased by reducing overfitting. The
    model gives more realistic recommendations by selecting the most relevant features.
    2.3. Performance metrics In order to measure the performance of machine learning
    algorithms, several performance metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision F-Measure,
    and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) are commonly used as performance metrics. In
    this section, we describe the metrics that have been used in most studies included
    in this review such as the coefficient of determination , the mean absolute error
    (MAE), and the root mean square error. , or the coefficient of determination,
    evaluates the proportion of the variance of the target variable that is explained
    by the model, as shown in Eq. (1): (1) is the observed value of the target variable,
    is the predicted value of the target variable, and represents the mean of the
    observed target variables. The highest possible value for is one, which means
    that the model is 100% accurate. However, this value can also be negative if the
    model produces slightly worse predictions. In the case of , the model is constant
    and always predicts the expected value of y, ignoring the input feature. Most
    often, values above 0.5 are considered good. or Mean Absolute Error is the average
    of the absolute difference between the observation and the predicted value, as
    shown in Eq. (2): (2) The root-mean-square error ( ), as shown in Eq. (3), assigns
    a high weight to large errors due to squaring. When the value is equal to 0, the
    model is considered to have the best fit. is less sensitive to large errors than
    and because equal weight is given to each error. (3) 3. ML based algorithms for
    nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation This section describes various
    machine learning algorithms used in the area of nutrient management and fertilizer
    recommendations. This review focuses primarily on the current state-of-the-art
    ML techniques for nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation. It addresses
    the many factors that influence yield and how machine learning could help predict
    fertilizer recommendations. Table 1 and Table 2 show a selection of articles from
    the literature on this topic. An extensive search was conducted to select relevant
    studies that use machine learning for nutritional management of cropping systems.
    In the first step, keywords such as “nutrient management”, “machine learning in
    agriculture”, “fertilizer forecasting” were used in various combinations including
    “machine learning in nutrient management”, “fertilizer recommendation tools with
    machine learning” for a broad search through Science Direct, Pubmed, and Scopus.
    At a first level, publications were classified into two general categories: Nitrogen
    Management and Nitrogen Phosphorous Potassium (NPK) Management. Only articles
    published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Although climate prediction
    is critical to agricultural productivity, it is not covered in this review because
    machine learning applications to climate prediction are part of a separate area
    of study. Finally, all articles covered here were selected for the period from
    2010 to July 2022 and found to be all within the scope of this work. Table 1.

    features The best nutrient management strategies are predicted based on a set
    of characteristics Khanal et al. (2018); Jian et al. (2020). For example, 17 nutrients
    are necessary for optimal crop development, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium. They are all equally important to crops, although their proportions
    are constantly changing. Because of these variations, the availability of nutrients
    in the soil affects plant growth, as the soil is the most important source of
    these nutrients for plants. If any of these nutrients are lacking, crop yield
    is reduced. In addition to the nutrients already mentioned, the following section
    discusses some other common features that can be divided into three categories:
    Climate is one of the most misunderstood factors in crop development Crane-Droesch
    (2018); Cai et al. (2019); Newlands et al. (2014). Although it may not appear
    so at first glance, water availability has a significant impact on agricultural
    productivity. Even low levels of rainfall can have a detrimental effect on crops,
    and production can fluctuate significantly due to extreme variations in rainfall
    amounts and periods. On the other hand, weather conditions are more complicated
    than just a rainy or dry climate. There are a number of climate features to consider.
    Total daily and annual precipitation, high-yield and well-distributed precipitation,
    and the Shannon diversity index (SDI) for precipitation are some of the most common.
    Other characteristics include daily maximum and minimum temperatures and total
    solar radiation, pest infestation under various atmospheric conditions and weather
    patterns. Algorithms for nutrient management include soil type and texture, organic
    matter, pH, accessible and exchangeable nutrients, total inorganic and organic
    carbon, and the total capacity of a soil to hold exchangeable cations (CEC). Qin
    et al. (2018) created two additional characteristics: a water table-adjusted available
    water capacity (AWCwt) and a ratio of cumulative seasonal precipitation to AWCwt
    (RAWCwt). Both features are used to reflect field-level hydrologic conditions
    and are dependent on conditions that are meant to showcase how soil hydrology
    impacts nitrogen dynamics. Taking into consideration that the amount of nitrogen
    lost under wet conditions is considered significantly negative for a soil''s ability
    to store water beyond the saturated zone, which is generally equal to the depth
    of the water table. Several soil management variables are considered and used
    as harvest management features: Planting date and density, date of nitrogen application
    (both at planting and side-dress application), grain yield, harvest key, fresh
    and dry biomass, fertilizer rate, and nutrient uptake Ahmed et al. (2021). The
    information contained in the red and near-infrared (NIR) canopy radiances is used
    mainly in common vegetation indices: Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI)[4] and Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)[5]. (4) (5) Where and represent the spectral
    radiances in the red and NIR regions, respectively. These indices increase the
    contrast between the ground and vegetation while reducing illumination effects.
    3.2. Nitrogen management based systems In recent years, many applications of nutrient
    management models have surfaced, especially regarding nitrogen recommendations,
    as it is considered very important for yield estimation Puntel et al. (2016);
    Dai et al. (2013); Castaldi et al. (2016); Shi et al. (2021). In the present time,
    the implementation of ML techniques for N management can be divided into different
    approaches such as EONR and NNI determination, remote sensing and spectroscopy.
    Determining the economically optimal amount of nitrogen can be influenced by various
    factors such as rainfall and management practices. Advances in ML paved the way
    for better Economic Optimum Nitrogen Rate (EONR) predictions that take these various
    parameters into account. Qin et al. (2018) looked at the prediction of EONR from
    field trial data at two different time points: i) seeding, ii) split application
    time points. Model-derived features such as AWCwt and RAWCwt and weather data
    were used to build the prediction algorithm. RR provided better results compared
    to LR, LASSO and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT). However, the results
    of this study cannot be generalized due to the limited data sets. Ransom et al.
    (2019) evaluated the ability of a set of machine learning and statistical algorithms
    to improve nitrogen recommendations for corn using measured soil properties along
    with weather variables from 49 sites in the Midwestern United States. The authors
    examined different modeling scenarios for improving three different nitrogen recommendation
    tools and tested whether adjustments for multicollinearity and accounting for
    the interaction between soil and weather parameters would result in improvements.
    Performance was evaluated using the out-of-sample RMSE and included soil and weather
    data prior to each nitrogen recommendation tool. RF provided better nitrogen recommendations,
    but compared to the performance of the models in terms of number of variables,
    the decision tree provided the best fit with the smallest number of variables.
    The results showed that reducing multicollinearity slightly improved the performance
    of the different ML algorithms. The objective of a study by Correndo et al. (2021)
    was defining the importance of soil, weather conditions, and cropping management
    in estimating and magnifying uncertainty in key components affecting the nitrogen
    response of corn yield. When yield without fertilizer, Yield at Economic Optimum
    N Rate (YEONR), and nitrogen fertilizer efficiency (NFE) are considered in EONR.
    Bayesian statistics were used for the N response curves fitting along with Extreme
    Gradient Boosting that evaluates the importance of the traits in the predictability
    process. EONR was the most difficult attribute to estimate, with an average uncertainty
    of 50 kg N ha-1. Weather accounted for about two-thirds of the variation in estimated
    values for YEONR, EONR, and NFE. Uncertainty in all aspects of the N response
    mechanism was also influenced by weather conditions (72% to 81%). With a constant
    but moderate contribution, soil factors explained both the predicted N response
    and the associated uncertainty (10% to 23%). Model uncertainty as a form of risk,
    potential seasonal weather predictions, and the development of probabilistic frameworks
    to optimize this data-driven decision process for corn nitrogen application should
    be considered in improving nitrogen decision support systems. Wang et al. (2021b)
    investigated the possibility of improving in-season N-nutrient index (NNI) along
    with corn grain yield prediction by combining management, soil, and weather data
    with’GreenSeeker’ data, an optical sensor that instantaneously measures crop health
    and vigor using NDVI. RFR was compared to Lasso linear regression (LLR), which
    contains similar combined data from multiple sources, and to the simple regression
    model, which uses only plant data. Studies of corn nitrogen fertilization and
    crop density were conducted at four sites in northeastern China. Using the RFR
    model to predict grain yield to simulate the response of corn grain yield response
    to a range of nitrogen fertilizer applications at different growth stages is an
    innovative method for seasonal nitrogen fertilizer recommendations that have been
    developed. The simulated results were as good as the measured results. The RFR
    model-based recommendation technique, which combines crop sensing data with soil
    data, is a promising avenue for corn nitrogen management. To improve machine learning-based
    N recommendation for seasonal seeding, additional data from the year of the site,
    varying conditions on the farm, and sensors with more spectral ranges are needed.
    Similarly, data from the RapidSCAN active canopy sensor was also combined with
    Genetic*Environmental*Management (G*E*M) information to increase the accuracy
    of NNI estimation in the Midwestern U.S. under a variety of weather, management
    and soil variables Li et al. (2022); Qiu et al. (2021) presented that conventional
    methods for monitoring nitrogen nutrient index (NNI) require manual real field
    measurement data, which is time-consuming and costly, red-green-blue (RGB) imagery
    from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an alternative. In this study, six machine
    learning algorithms were used to extract relevant data for predicting the NNI
    and vegetation index (VI). The results of predicting the NNI of rice using these
    algorithms showed that the methods of RF performed the best in each growing season,
    with the best NNI prediction occurring during the filling and early maturity stages.
    At the early maturity stage, rice NNI was found to be significantly related to
    both available nitrogen in the soil (AN) and yield. Combining RGB imagery from
    UAVs with ML algorithms provided a robust and simple solution for instant validation
    of rice NNI that improved nitrogen use efficiency and provided suggestions for
    precise fertilization in rice crops despite its limited accuracy. Modern remote
    sensing methods for precise nutrient management and fertilization could then be
    divided into two approaches: Deep learning methods for predictions based on multiple
    remote sensing data or multivariate regressions Wang et al. (2021a). Barbosa et
    al. (2020a) used five input variables (nitrogen rate, seed rate, elevation map,
    soil electrical conductivity, and the NDVI index) to estimate corn yield production
    using a deep-learning approach, and the results were compared with other machine
    learning approaches (Fully connected neural network (FNN), multiple linear regression
    (MLR), SVM, and RF regression models). Although a reduction in RMSE of up to 29%
    was validated compared to the random forest, it should be noted that the deep
    learning model, satellite data, required a total of 1800 plots to be defined.This
    study also shows that the most benefit comes from the higher variability of the
    spatial structure of the data. In their study, Escalante et al. (2019) investigated
    the recognition performance of a set of classifiers and deep learning convolutional
    neural networks for evaluating optimal fertilization using RGB images as input.
    The average LOO cross-validation performance was presented for each of the studied
    classifiers and each of the pre-trained models. The percentage of correctly identified
    images is used to quantify the performance. ANN, SVM and Adaboost performed the
    best with an accuracy of 81.9%, 80.5% and 83.3%, respectively. Considering that
    only visual features (Barley variety, Fertilizer rate, Vegetation indexes) extracted
    from RGB images were used, these are promising results (random guessing leads
    to an accuracy of 33%). This could be due to the fact that sophisticated models
    are more specific to the target they were created for, while a simple model can
    be more general and captures relevant information for the representation of images.
    Yu et al. (2018) used a deep learning-based regression model with a fully connected
    neural network (FNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to quantify nitrogen concentration
    in canola leaves. SAE was used to infer deep spectral features in the visible
    and near-infrared regions from a hyperspectral image of a canola leaf, which in
    turn were used as input data for the FNN to predict N content. With , RMSEP =
    0.307%, and a residual prediction error RPDp = 3.238 for N concentration, the
    model SAE-FNN performed quite well. The results show that with a combination of
    hyperspectral imaging and deep learning, it is possible to quickly and non-destructively
    detect N concentration in canola leaves to provide better fertilizer recommendations.
    In another study, Deep Learning was used to detect nitrogen deficiency in corn.
    For this purpose, four CNN models were pre-trained by applied transfer learning,
    considering (V4, V6 and R1) as growth stages. The leaf samples were then digitized
    to generate 384 images representing the 16 nitrogen treatments considered in the
    study. The results showed significant differences with respect to each growth
    stage. However, CNNs built using RGB images provided great results (average 61.8%)
    compared to traditional text-based methods (average 50–60%) Montes Condori et
    al. (2017). Similarly, in the study by Kou et al. (2022), RGB images of the cotton
    canopy were acquired using a UAV digital camera. The nitrogen content of the cotton
    canopy was predicted using two cotton cultivars and six nitrogen gradients. Forty-six
    features were extracted from the image after image preprocessing, and CNN were
    used to extract deep features. Pearson and partial least squares were used feature
    selection. For accurate prediction of nitrogen content of cotton crowns, manual
    features were used as input to build linear regression models, support vector
    machines, and one-dimensional CNN regression models. Deep learning based features
    were used as inputs to build a two-dimensional CNN regression model. The results
    were and RMSE = 1.67 g kg-1 for Xinluzao 45 and and RMSE = 3.13 g kg-1 for Xinluzao
    53, indicating that cotton nitrogen content can be predicted on a large scale
    using UAV RGB images and machine learning. However, the accuracy and stability
    of the prediction model still need to be improved due to insufficient data samples.
    In addition, soil properties such as total nitrogen can be determined by combining
    ML algorithms and spectroscopy. These algorithms are an excellent alternative
    to simple regression models when the goal is to increase the accuracy of the regression.
    Partial least square regression (PLSR) is a widely used approach for processing
    multivariable inputs, extracting successive linear combinations of the spectra
    to achieve the coupled goals of effectively explaining response variation and
    optimally explaining predictor variation. This is the most commonly used method
    in soil spectroscopy and chemometrics and has proven successful in assessing water
    and nitrogen status. The availability of large data sets coupled with better training
    and the provision of highly accurate models is one of the major challenges for
    this system when applied to nutritional management. Predictive models have been
    developed using several technologies, including PLSR, which reduces the number
    of features required, and neural networks, which compensate for nonlinearity Wang
    et al. (2021a); Tavakoli and Gebbers (2019); Morellos et al. (2016). Table 1 summarizes
    and includes brief descriptions of the above studies. 3.3. NPK management based
    systems The development of NPK management based systems follows two general approaches
    based the type of input, namely field data (soil tests, fertilization trials,
    etc.) or RGB and hyperspectral images. Yu et al. (2010) developed a fertilizer
    model with data points from 10 experimental fields with 4 fertilizer rates and
    14 treatments. A neural network ensemble was presented to calculate the fertilizer
    rate more accurately. The authors used K-means clustering to select the best networks
    individually and then combined the models using a Lagrange multiplier. A fertilizer
    model was created using the ensemble method for neural networks described above.
    In this model, soil nutrient content and fertilizer rate are used as inputs to
    the neural network, while yield is considered as an output. With this approach,
    the calculation of fertilizer rates becomes a programming problem and can be used
    to determine the fertilizer rate with the highest yield and profit and to predict
    the yield. This fertilizer model was also validated using data on the effect of
    fertilizers. The results show that using an ensemble of neural networks to predict
    yield is more accurate than using individual neural networks. According to Cholissodin
    et al. (2016), the integrated artificial neural network (ANN) can not only optimize
    fertilizer rates for corn, but also when used in conjunction with Bidirectional
    Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (BIPSO), the fusion provides better results.
    The ANN approach provided good results in predicting recommendations using field
    trial data as training data, while BIPSO optimized multiple features simultaneously,
    which accelerated the operation of the system. The smallest mean square error
    (MSE) value was obtained by 10-fold cross-validation, repeating CV hundreds of
    times. The goal of the study was to initially use ML in pasture and rotational
    cropping and then extend it to other crops based on the results, which could lead
    to new insights when used as input by other researchers. Kouadio et al. (2018)
    investigated the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to analyze soil fertility
    parameters and produce an effective yield estimate. The effectiveness of different
    ELM-based models based on Soil organic matter (SOM), accessible exchangeable nutrients,
    and pH was tested with single and multiple combinations of predictor variables.
    The results of the ELM model were compared with those of existing predictive techniques
    such as MLR and RF. The authors believe that the ELM model makes a unique contribution
    to the agricultural sector, particularly in terms of selecting optimal soil parameters
    for predicting coffee yields. The research demonstrates the potential value of
    combining machine learning with biophysical crop models. Moreno et al. (2018)
    found that they could determine the fertilizers and amendments needed for pasture
    production based on the major nutrients in the soil. They used a multilayer perceptron
    network trained with the backpropagation algorithm. For fertilizers and additives,
    a multilayer artificial neural network was trained with an input layer consisting
    of soil test variables and an output layer with many simultaneous outputs. The
    MSE of the test data and its standard deviation, and the MSE of the training data
    and its standard deviation were used to determine the quality of each neural network.
    The objective of the study was to develop a recommendation system suitable for
    pasture cropping despite the limited amount of data. Suchithra and Pai (2020)
    developed a system based on soil test results to classify and predict soil fertility
    indices and pH values based on various soil characteristics. The algorithm used
    in this study was an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification and prediction.
    This algorithm provides better-generalized results by feeding forward NN with
    a single hidden layer (SLFNs). The potassium fertility index had an accuracy of
    up to 78%, while the pH classification was up to 89%. The activation function
    in this NN that had the best classification, accuracy, and kappa values was the
    GRB function. Similarly, Timsina et al. (2021) also compared three different nutrient
    management strategies for common cereals considering various factors such as nutrient
    use efficiency (NUE). A developed site-specific decision support system Nutrient
    Expert (NE) was used to evaluate the nutrient balance of the field by analyzing
    past yields or costs. RF algorithm showed that NUE for rice and P and K uptake
    for wheat and maize were the most important factors contributing to grain yield.
    Random Forest was used in the study by Yan et al. (2021) to quantify the relative
    importance of different traits (Phosphorous (P) fertilization practices, region,
    soil properties, variety, and cropping system) on yield response to P and agronomic
    efficiency of P in maize. Although this algorithm produced very good results,
    Maize variety was selected as the most important factor affecting yield. The study
    encountered several limitations that should be considered in future studies, such
    as the differences in yield and agronomic efficiency between regions, the different
    release of fertilizer-P in soil dynamics, and the fact that only top soil samples
    were used rather than the entire soil profile. Coulibali et al. (2020) investigated
    and compared machine learning and probabilistic models with site-specific predictive
    models for fertilization of potato crops in eastern Canada. Using statistical
    models, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) performance is often associated with fertilizer
    requirements. Because of the many variables involved, such as soil, land management,
    genotypes, weather, and pests and diseases, it is difficult to predict appropriate
    nutrient levels. This study compared different models for evaluating NPK requirements
    for high quality and yield as a function of soil, land management, and weather.
    They used data from 273 field trials conducted in Quebec between 1979 and 2017.
    Predictions from k-nearest neighbors, RF, NN, hierarchical Mitscherlich model,
    and Gaussian processes were created, tested, and compared. For the prediction
    of marketable tuber yield, the ML models gave values of 0.49–0.59, which were
    higher than the of the Mitscherlich model (0.37). Some models did not agree in
    obtaining optimal rates from dose-response surfaces under constant conditions.
    Gaussian processes proved to be a promising method for site-specific fertilizer
    recommendations that can reduce economic or agronomic risks because of their ability
    to make suggestions in the context of probabilistic risk assessment. RGB or hyperspectral
    images can be used to detect nutrient deficiencies at early growth stages non-destructively.
    In their study, Backhaus et al. (2011) investigated whether supervised approaches
    for predicting plant nutritional status using classification models are robust
    enough to handle large data sets with significant variance, such as leaf age or
    pixel position in the leaf. The learning algorithms tested were SVM, Generalized
    Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (GRLVQ), Supervised Relevance Neural Gas
    (SRNG), and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network. Leaf growth stage had the greatest
    impact on classification accuracy, with SVM and RBF providing reliable results
    and SRNG and GRLVQ techniques falling to nearly determinable values. The importance
    of spectral bands in predicting nutrient content was estimated using three cameras
    covering the visible and shortwave infrared spectrum (VIS /SWIR). The simple separation
    of pixels of veins and epidermis proved to be a source of confounding variance
    for nutrient categorization in this work, but had little effect on actual classification
    performance. Leaf age had a much stronger effect on GRLVQ, SRNG, and SVM classification
    performance (simple spectra) for nutrient states, such that it was close to the
    rate. Automatic detection of nutrient deficiencies in leaves of oil palm using
    a visual system and pattern recognition was presented by Asraf et al. (2012).
    In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is also used as a classifier using
    three different kernels: a linear kernel, hard edge polynomial kernel and a soft
    edge polynomial kernel. According to the preliminary data, the SVM classifiers
    were able to detect oil palm leaves. The soft-edge polynomial kernel was able
    to accurately classify nutritional disorders in oil palm leaves with 95% correctness.
    Support vector feature selection (SVFS), as a variant of SVM, showed great potential
    in selecting relevant features for nutritional deficiencies. Images of the top
    three leaves of a rice plant (Oryza sativa L.) and associated leaf sheaths were
    acquired using static scanning techniques. Thirty-two spectral and shape features
    were identified from these images by fusion of an RGB mean function and a Matlab
    region-prop function. NPK deficiencies were effectively detected using hierarchical
    identification. The overall accuracy of NPK deficiencies for the four growth stages
    was 86.15, 87.69, 90.00, and 89.23%, respectively. Validation was performed with
    data from different years, and the accuracies were 83.08, 83.08, 89.23, and 90.77%,
    respectively Chen et al. (2014). In the study by Ghosal et al. (2018) individual
    soybean leaves that exhibited a range of deficiency symptoms such as potassium
    and iron were manually selected and collected in the field by destructive sampling.
    The leaves and charts were manually recorded with a digital camera. In this way,
    25,000 images were collected and labeled to create a dataset of leaf images. The
    authors used a CNN classifier and were able to achieve an accuracy of 94%. In
    this study, a deep machine vision based approach was used to detect early symptoms
    of stress. The presented method is widely applicable in modern agriculture and
    provides accurate and not time-consuming immediate stress detection. This method
    has been shown to be relatively insensitive to illumination variations, making
    it a simple technique for large-scale stress detection. Another deep-learning
    approach was developed by Culman et al. (2017), who presented PalmHand, a unique
    smart-device application that allows farmers to detect instant oil palm deficiencies
    using leaf images. The developed app works as an IoT device that stores and analyzes
    historical data collected from numerous users simultaneously in the cloud. A single
    MLP was used to classify oil palms into one of four possible categories. The MLP
    classified the image into four categories corresponding to a healthy palm or a
    specimen deficient in potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), or nitrogen (N). The average
    macroprecision and accuracy were 0.67 and 0.50, respectively. Considering the
    limited dataset available for training the classifier, these results were considered
    promising evidence for the concept. However, no information was provided on the
    circumstances under which the 52 RGB images were acquired. Similarly no details
    concerning the data were shared in the work of Archana and Saranya (2020) that
    proposed a method focusing on macronutrients (NPK), soil pH and electrical conductivity,
    and temperature to provide the best crop recommendations. Crop rotation, fertilizer
    recommendations, forecasting, and crop production prediction were part of the
    collaborative proposed system. The objective of this study was to develop a system
    that combines an agricultural dataset and uses a voting-based ensemble as a classification
    algorithm to recommend suitable crops. It was found that yield prediction could
    be of great help to farmers in increasing their yields. Crop rotation has shown
    good results in improving soil fertility when applied regularly. This technique
    helps in making fertilizer decisions that are beneficial to farmers. This system
    had an accuracy of 92%. Although machine learning is widely used in agriculture
    in general and in nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations in particular,
    the literature shows that research needs to focus on the availability of data,
    including all the important factors that need to be used to overcome the limitations
    Ransom et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2021b); Yu et al. (2010); Cholissodin et al.
    (2016). Table 2 summarizes the above work for the case of nutrient management
    subcategory. 4. Summary and outlook The development of a nutrient management tool
    using machine learning generated a great deal of interest in the scientific community,
    which recognized the importance of food security and the sustainability of its
    processes Thompson et al. (2015). With the revolution that our modern agriculture
    is experiencing today, the use of various sensors, smart irrigation systems, and
    remote sensing, more and more datasets are becoming available Chlingaryan et al.
    (2018). These large datasets have emerged simultaneously with major advances in
    computer science such as machine learning, which has led to incredible breakthroughs
    in this research area. In this paper, we collected and reviewed various machine
    learning approaches in the field of nutrient management. Analysis of these articles
    revealed that in the nitrogen management category, Random Forests was the most
    frequently used ML algorithm. The popularity of RFs correlated with better results
    ( was up to 0.97 Qiu et al. (2021)). In the NPK category, many models such as
    SVMs were used, but an RF-based algorithm gave the best score Timsina et al. (2021).
    In the Nitrogen category, we can see a high presence of image inputs, reflecting
    the emerging trend and the wide use of multi-source images (HS, RGB, NIR, etc.).
    This has been enabled by the development and affordability of this technology
    along with high computational power. By integrating machine learning with IoT
    data, farm management systems are evolving into true artificial intelligence systems
    that provide better recommendations and insights for future decisions and actions,
    with the goal of increasing productivity. To this end, it is envisioned that the
    use of machine learning models will become even more popular over time, enabling
    the development of integrated and applicable technologies. Despite the great strides
    that have been made recently in the field of nutrient management, actual practical/accurate
    application is currently a challenge. Many limitations have come to light that
    are related to the methods used and are both intrinsically and extrinsically related
    to the target problem. The current state of nutrient management using digital
    imagery and machine learning was also discussed to provide an in-depth analysis
    of the various challenges faced by many researchers working on this topic. Collecting
    datasets with such precise factors and for a specific crop is usually not an easy
    task, considering that not all available datasets are representative enough of
    the variation found in the field. To determine suitability for practical application,
    basic data from studies of crop response to nutrients in fields with cross-validation
    are needed. Soil properties John et al. (2020), plant density, weather indices,
    plant variety, plant growth stage and N, P, and K fertilizer rates, are all very
    important and should be considered in data collection because they can directly
    affect the model output Trontelj ml and Chambers (2021). Yield response can vary
    by plant variety in addition to the fertilizer rate proposed by recommendation
    systems. In addition, field trials would directly impact yield and improve not
    only biomass, but also solution sustainability and soil health. This practice
    would shed light on forgotten features such as SOM and tillage systems, leading
    to a better understanding of soil dynamics and better recommendations. For example,
    Ransom et al. (2019) and Qin et al. (2018) tested several models and algorithms
    to improve nitrogen requirement for corn. In the case of Ransom et al. (2019),
    the was up to 0.94, with data sets collected from 49 experimental sites in the
    Midwestern United States. While in Qin et al. (2018) was only 0.46, using data
    from a limited number of sites. Both studies tested the effect of ML algorithms
    on nutrient management but reached different conclusions due to the quality and
    size of the data they used. The most critical point to mention is that many people
    see machine learning as a solution to future needs in agriculture. On the other
    hand, machine learning only provides the best recommendations based on the inputs.
    In practice, various soil parameters need to be considered to achieve greater
    or higher yields and better environmental performance than traditional fertilizer
    management systems. However, to fully understand this system, a standardized research
    technique based on site-specific parameters is required. We believe that a comprehensive
    knowledge of what accuracy means is insufficient. As a result, different technologies,
    procedures, and criteria for accuracy and good results have been used, leading
    to a scenario of conflicting results. We also find that all approaches look at
    single procedures and solutions and are not sufficiently linked to the decision
    process as is the case in other application areas. The real problem is understanding
    the right path to the best nutrient management recommendations and making them
    accessible and understandable to farmers. Researchers should also focus on the
    transition between great modeling results and tangible practices to achieve them.
    From most of the articles reviewed, we can conclude that there were strong correlations
    between model accuracy and dataset size and quality. Compiling comprehensive data
    sets that account for all the different scenarios and variabilities is the most
    difficult task Barbedo (2019), but is considered key to accurate results. The
    first step would be to identify the data source, which could include field studies
    and research. Second, we need to collect data on soil type and climate from research
    studies and APIs. We also need data on crop type, crop yield, and management data
    that can be obtained from farmers, extension services, and government agencies.
    Finally, the collected data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This includes
    removing outliers and normalizing the data to combine them into a single data
    set that can be used by the ML algorithm. However, we believe that data availability
    is the bottleneck when it comes to taking full advantage of what ML can offer
    to the field of fertilizer recommendations. We encourage researchers to share
    their data with the community to enhance the capabilities and impact of the research.
    We also encourage researchers developing ML-based recommendation systems to suggest
    the best suitable features and develop other features that can be collected at
    a large scale. In addition, it is crucial to standardize the methodological approach
    to nutrient management systems based on a detailed description of the entire system
    so that results from different experiments and parts of the world can be logically
    compared. The accessibility of powerful machine learning tools and techniques
    on many open source platforms is certainly beneficial to the research community.
    However, this also leads to many misleading publications by researchers who either
    do not know exactly what ML expertise is required or do not have the proper soil
    and plant nutrient knowledge. This phenomenon has led to a great pipe dream Schut
    and Giller (2020); Lischeid et al. (2022); Paudel et al. (2021) in which scientists
    confirm the accuracy of their models while considering the wrong parameters. Given
    the rapid progress ML has made in recent decades, it is very likely that the world
    will see an increase in the applications of ML models. The integration and applications
    are becoming more and more remarkable. ML algorithms show great potential when
    properly used for support or decision-making. The fusion of spectral and spatial
    features and unique hybrid processing systems that complement each other''s limitations
    would definitely improve the understanding of soil dynamics. This success will
    likely be paired with better yields leading to a more food-secure world. Declaration

    irrigation (PI) in agriculture aims at keeping high crop yields with minimal water
    to reduce farm costs, such as electricity, and the environmental footprint (García
    et al., 2020). In other words, it determines exactly when, where, and how much
    water to apply to the soil (Kamienski et al., 2019). Efficient water management
    is essential under socioeconomic and environmental aspects since 70–80% of the
    world''s freshwater is consumed by agriculture. Water has been increasingly considered
    a scarce natural resource, making its rational use a matter of food safety for
    future generations (Grafton et al., 2018, Duran-Encalada et al., 2017). The recent
    advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies allow us to collect data with
    greater spatial–temporal granularity and enable higher level of automation. Throughout
    this paper, spatial–temporal refers to the nature of data, covering different
    geographical spaces and time frames, and granular means that data is collected
    at very short time intervals and from different places within one or multiple
    fields. These factors bring about the so-called smart irrigation era (Kamienski
    et al., 2019, Miranda et al., 2019), where data-driven approaches based on machine
    learning models are gaining widespread popularity. These approaches have expanded
    the range of applications in precision irrigation but face challenges due to the
    current stage of technology maturity (Togneri et al., 2019a, Lezoche et al., 2020).
    The success of smart irrigation depends on an accurate water need estimation (WNE),
    i.e., the calculation of the ideal amount of water the irrigation system applies
    to the soil to assure that the plant roots have an adequate moisture until the
    next irrigation opportunity (Jensen & Allen, 2016). The WNE process has many steps:
    data sourcing, estimation of the current soil moisture, soil water dynamics changes
    due to future environmental conditions, and the calculation of the amount of water
    to irrigate (Jensen & Allen, 2016). We refer to water dynamics as the hydrodynamic
    behavior of the soil, which depends on its physical–chemical structure, slope,
    surrounding geography, amount and speed of water intake and outtake (Jensen &
    Allen, 2016). WNE is a complex subject, and its importance to smart irrigation
    requires further attention. Specific issues about IoT architectures, irrigation
    decision-making, and machine learning approaches are out of scope, although we
    indicate references whenever these topics are mentioned. The main contribution
    of this paper is to highlight the importance and focus on the entire WNE process,
    including modern data-driven approaches, which are not adequately covered by the
    literature. To that end, we establish four specific objectives covered by 2 WNE:
    foundation, 3 Interaction graph, 4 The state of the art, 4.3 Feature engineering,
    4.4 Data sourcing, 5 Discussion: • Review the background and develop intuition
    about WNE (Section 2). • Understand the key topics and how they interact to generate
    a graph-shaped map providing a big picture of the process and developing awareness
    about the approaches, from sensing technologies (e.g., IoT) to WNE delivery (Section
    3). • Identify the literature with the most current view on the WNE process, key
    topics, and recent research trends (Section 4). • Discuss trends in WNE and provide
    our vision for the future (Section 5). 2. WNE: foundation WNE, also known as agriculture/irrigation/crop
    water demand or water requirements, is highly impacted by soil water dynamics.
    The ultimate objective of precision irrigation is to keep an ideal amount of water
    in the root zone that allows plants to develop their full potential. To achieve
    this objective, one must avoid both under and over-irrigation by adding only minimal
    water when necessary. That is, extreme and harmful conditions must be avoided:
    too much soil water may lead to flood and leaching, and too little may lead to
    plant water stress. In this paper, we refer to soil water content as soil moisture,
    a synonymous term used more recently in the literature (Jensen & Allen, 2016).
    2.1. WNE dependencies WNE is a complex task that depends not only on the gap between
    current soil moisture and its ideal value but also on other variables. First,
    future weather conditions influence water intake (from precipitation or groundwater)
    and outtake (soil water evaporation and plant transpiration). Second, soil water
    dynamics governs what happens with water through time. Third, operational constraints
    often do not allow continuous irrigation (e.g., only possible in some specific
    time windows or with an interval between events). Moreover, we need to consider
    the impact of delayed irrigations on the soil moisture, which requires a higher
    understanding of weather and soil. Next, we summarize some WNE dependencies: (i)
    Current soil moisture: Soil moisture (SM) is the amount of water stored in the
    soil within the plant''s root zone, held entirely by capillary forces (Topp, el
    al., 2008). It is frequently measured as the ratio of the weight of water to the
    weight of the solids or as a percentage of water volume to the total volume. Alternative
    literature jargons are soil water storage (SWS) and soil water content (SWC) (Jensen
    & Allen, 2016). (ii) Ideal soil moisture: An ideal amount of water optimizes plant
    development (Jensen & Allen, 2016), which also depends on soil properties (dictates
    how much water can be held), crop, and plant phenological stage. In most cases,
    the ideal point is near the maximum SM capacity without surpassing the flooding
    or leaching point because that is when water is more abundant and, therefore,
    easily accessed by the plant. However, there are cases where plants benefit from
    different conditions, such as paddy fields that are frequently flood-irrigated
    (Kuo, Ho, & Liu, 2006). Also, vineyards are frequently submitted to intermittent
    water deficits to induce plant water stress and optimize grape properties for
    high-quality wine production (Matese et al., 2018, Intrigliolo et al., 2018, Bellvert
    et al., 2021). We can calculate the gap from the current SM employing the ideal
    point. (iii) Operational Constraints of Irrigation Systems: As mentioned before,
    irrigation systems have operational constraints that prevent irrigation from occurring
    continuously or whenever needed. For example, large fields frequently use traveling
    sprinkles or central pivots as irrigation systems (Burt et al., 2000, Abioye et
    al., 2020), which means that a specific part of the field can only be irrigated
    when the equipment is passing through it. This situation implies a periodicity
    in which the traveling speed defines the irrigation intervals. Another operational
    constraint is the dependence on electricity tariff policies (García et al., 2016,
    Abrishambaf et al., 2020). In some places, energy is expensive during the day,
    forcing the farm management to irrigate only in less costly periods. Therefore,
    understanding the SM behavior between irrigation events is paramount, which must
    consider water outtake and intake processes. (iv) Water outtake and intake forecast:
    Water outtake and intake processes depend on the weather, making weather forecast
    essential. Future precipitation is the primary source of water intake, while future
    water outtake is mostly dependent on temperatures, relative humidity, solar radiation,
    and wind speed (Jensen & Allen, 2016). (v) Soil water dynamics: SM varies with
    time due to the influence the root zone suffers from environmental conditions
    and events, such as weather, crop, and soil properties (Jensen & Allen, 2016).
    Soil structure and texture are the most determinant characteristics of soil water
    behavior (Van Genuchten, 1980, Rawls et al., 1991), but others, like biological
    and chemical characteristics, also play a relevant role (Minasny and McBratney,
    2018, Yu et al., 2018, Obia et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020). The remainder of
    this section refines the understanding of the WNE dependencies. 2.2. System view
    Soil water dynamics have been studied extensively as a closed system in the root
    zone. Within this context, a series of factors influence the water intake and
    outtake (Jensen and Allen, 2016, Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2007, Pereira
    et al., 2020). This approach, known as soil water balance (SWB), models soil water
    dynamics along with inputs and outputs for estimation. Fig. 1 depicts the details
    of the System View. Initially, we admit that the root zone contains a specific
    water content. The factors that mostly influence water intake are precipitation
    and irrigation, with the capillary rise as a secondary water source. Water infiltration
    of precipitation and irrigation water usually depends on soil structure, texture,
    biological/chemical conditions, and the soil slope at a given location. In other
    words, water can then infiltrate, stay at the soil surface, or even experience
    surface runoff. The factors that commonly influence most water outtake are soil
    water evaporation (direct effect from atmospheric conditions) and plant transpiration
    (side effect from water use by photosynthesis) which together are called evapotranspiration
    (ET). Deep percolation might occur when root zone soil exceeds its capacity to
    hold water in its pores. Moreover, subsurface lateral flow can also occur depending
    on the location slope, both for water intake and outtake. Download : Download

    balance – Closed system view (Fig. 1, Fig. 2 are adapted from (Jensen & Allen,
    2016). In the past, measuring SM directly by soil sensors was challenging (IoT
    was not yet well established), and the typical approach for WNE has been via calculation
    of soil water balance (SWB) based on its main factors: precipitation (intake)
    and evapotranspiration (outtake) (Jensen & Allen, 2016). That is, WNE has traditionally
    been estimated indirectly, not by direct SM measurement. Precipitation is measured
    by weather stations, and evapotranspiration is usually inferred from weather data
    (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed). Furthermore,
    crop vegetation data is usually extracted from open or low-cost satellite services
    (Jarman & Dimmock, 2018). That strategy was a feasible and low-cost solution that
    has been working reasonably well for decades, and even nowadays, it is still primarily
    used and studied. The principle is simple: eventual negative water balance between
    evapotranspiration and precipitation should be compensated by irrigation. Both
    precipitation and evapotranspiration rely upon weather data, and weather forecast
    plays a relevant role in helping to estimate soil water behavior in the short
    term and allowing more precise estimates (Delgoda et al., 2016). Precipitation
    forecast is the most critical process, as we do not want the sum of irrigation
    and short-term future precipitation to exceed soil water capacity and cause leaching.
    Other approaches leverage from that: modeling and adding the effects of other
    water balance factors, like infiltration, surface runoff, subsurface flows, capillary
    rise, and deep percolation (Jensen and Allen, 2016, Delgoda et al., 2016). With
    the development of IoT, measuring SM directly and with higher spatial–temporal
    resolution has been possible. Therefore, current and forecasted SM data are also
    used for WNE, alongside precipitation and evapotranspiration data (Togneri et
    al., 2019b). 2.3. Evapotranspiration (ET) Evapotranspiration cannot be directly
    obtained since estimating evaporation and transpiration separately is not easy.
    More direct methods for evapotranspiration measurement (e.g., weighting lysimeter
    and eddy covariance) are generally expensive and do not account for spatiality
    (Verstraeten et al., 2008, Liou and Kar, 2014). Conversely, physical and empirical
    models based on sensing data (primarily from weather stations and satellites)
    were developed and became popular (Jensen & Allen, 2016). They produce indirect
    but reasonable estimates at low cost and implementation complexity. There are
    two main strands of estimation models: (i) Surface energy balance approach: Net
    radiation flux ( )5, soil heat flux ( )6, and sensible heat flux ( ) 7are typically
    calculated from remotely sensed data in visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared
    bands, while the latent heat flux ( , a proxy for evapotranspiration measured
    in energy rate) is calculated as a residual of the term in the energy balance
    equation: (Calera et al., 2017, Barker et al., 2018). That is a method based on
    energy flux measurements, balancing between energy inputs to and outputs from
    earth surface. It is calculated as the residual energy relative to water vaporing
    (water outtake, usually occurring at daylight) minus condensing (water intake,
    usually occurring at night). Surface energy balance techniques use various physical
    and empirical-based models, input data, and assumptions to solve the energy balance
    equation fully or partially. The most common procedure is to adopt daily aggregations,
    which always have positive values (water outtake in balance). Liou and Kar, 2014,
    McShane et al., 2017 provide a detailed review of various surface energy balance
    algorithms used for estimating landscape-scale evapotranspiration at high spatial
    resolution and discussed their results under physical basis, assumptions, uncertainties,
    and limitations. (ii) Weather data-based and crop coefficient approach (Jensen
    & Allen, 2016): Physical and empirical models estimate the so-called reference
    evapotranspiration ( ), which is the evapotranspiration for theoretical reference
    vegetation (a specific type of grass with uniform cover). To achieve the actual
    crop evapotranspiration ( ), is multiplied by estimated constants ( and ) that
    represent adjustments for the conditions of a specific crop. is convenient for
    depending exclusively on weather data as the crop is arbitrated constant (the
    reference vegetation). Among several physical-empirical models to estimate Penman-Monteith
    (Allen, et al., 1998) has a special place, considered the most precise and flexible
    method, applicable to many different world regions and for different time frames
    – monthly, weekly, daily, and even hourly. However, this method requires a wide
    range of weather data (air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind
    speed, geographical location, and a sort of radiation-related variables) that,
    in some cases, can be relatively difficult to obtain. The Hargreaves method (Hargreaves
    & Allen, 2003) is a simpler and more popular alternative when weather data is
    limited, only requiring a few readily accessible parameters: minimum, maximum,
    and mean temperature, as well as extraterrestrial radiation. There are many alternative
    models, but they are usually of limited geographical applicability (Jensen & Allen,
    2016). The crop coefficient ( ) is usually determined by establishing empirical
    statistical relationships between reference and crop evapotranspiration at any
    moment of crop phenological stages, considering the crop without any restrictions
    (well-watered crop and optimal agronomic conditions). Remarkably, there are statistical
    relationships with remotely sensed vegetation indexes, which is helpful in many
    situations (Ozier-Lafontaine and Bajazet, 2005, Aulen and Shipley, 2012). Leaf
    area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are two common
    remoted sensed indexes used to analyze natural or agricultural vegetation status
    (Ozier-Lafontaine and Bajazet, 2005, Aulen and Shipley, 2012). The result of is
    , known as crop potential evapotranspiration. The stress coefficient ( ), in turn,
    applies adjustments to considering any restrictions imposed on the crop (water
    or agronomical stress) so that the result of is , known as adjusted crop evapotranspiration
    or actual crop evapotranspiration. Crop evapotranspiration changes relevantly
    while the crop evolves through its phenological stages (Jensen & Allen, 2016).
    There is only evaporation in the initial stage, where the soil is bare, as there
    are no plants to cause transpiration. As the crop grows and vegetation cover increases
    (crop development stage), transpiration takes over most of the water outtake and
    causes the overall crop evapotranspiration to grow. Therefore, water outtake is
    much higher in a mature crop (mid-season stage). At the end of the season (late
    season stage), the crop goes into senescence after the peak of green mass production,
    causing transpiration and crop evapotranspiration to decrease. 2.4. Soil water
    retention curve (SWRC) Water is retained in soil pores, primarily by the capillary
    effect against gravity. Some soil types can retain more water than others or retain
    water more stably. Furthermore, the same water content level in different soils
    can represent different constraints for the plant to consume water. Thus, each
    soil is unique in its characteristics, which are particularly important to understand
    soil water dynamics. For this reason, a common practice is determining the soil
    water retention curve (SWRC) of a specific soil, usually estimated by curve fitting
    to empirical points from the laboratory or in loco experiments with soil samples
    (Jensen & Allen, 2016). Fig. 2 illustrates how SWRC works by contrasting SM (measured
    as a percentage of water volume to the total volume) and soil matric potential
    (SMP). The latter is a way of measuring soil water availability, interpreted as
    the difficulty of a plant in accessing water in a particular soil, measured in
    by a tensiometer (Kashyap & Kumar, 2021). As the SMP increases, it becomes increasingly
    challenging for plants to access water. The most popular approach to estimating
    SWRC is the Van Genuchten method and its variations (Van Genuchten, 1980). Download

    Example of soil water retention curve (SWRC). In-between irrigation events, soil
    water dynamics combined with environmental conditions dictate changes in SM. Moreover,
    as the weather is uncertain, these future changes are also uncertain. In such
    an unsettled scenario, keeping water content at an optimal value does not make
    sense. Instead, it makes more sense to establish an optimal range of water content
    rather than a single target. This optimal range can be observed in Fig. 2, and
    lies between the Wilting Point (WP, beyond which the plant starts to suffer from
    water stress and wilt due to the difficulty of accessing water) and the Field
    Capacity (FC, in which SM is near the maximum water the soil can hold and beyond
    it, water may percolate and cause leaching). In short, it is the range wherein
    plants can easily consume water. In the example in the figure, the optimal range
    is between 25% and 37% of SM, which is the target range for the irrigation system.
    The SWRC varies with soil depth as the soil properties change, so for deep roots
    it could be beneficial to consider SWRC for different depths through the root
    system (Wijewardana, et al., 2016). 2.5. Water need estimation (WNE) Once we know
    the optimal SM range to pursue and understand the uncertainty of its future behavior,
    we can ideally approach WNE as a forecasting task (Karandish and Šimůnek, 2016,
    Adeyemi et al., 2018). Fig. 3 shows an example of estimating water needs for any
    future time to help us to understand the WNE process. Unlike other approaches
    discussed in Section 4, our model provides a simpler way to visualize andof gain
    intuition over the WNE process. In Fig. 3-a, SM is forecasted, the red dashes
    delimiting a range of expected values for future time points. The expected values
    are due to soil water dynamics based on weather forecast variables such as air
    temperature, radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed, but without considering
    precipitation events. The light green range represents the desirable SM range
    at each future time point, designed to: a) avoid reaching the wilting point in
    the desired time horizon; b) avoid the field capacity point considering possible
    precipitation events. The possibility of precipitation is represented in blue,
    lowering the levels of maximum recommended water deltas. There is a range between
    a minimum and a maximum water delta. Giving ranges for all future points (where
    there is reasonable forecasting confidence) provides freedom to an optimized irrigation
    scheduler to choose the best time and SM delta value to apply according to its
    utility function (in which water is usually just one of the factors to consider
    (Jabro et al., 2020, Li and Hu, 2020)). Download : Download high-res image (497KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Water Need Estimation (WNE) – Example
    of an advanced approach. In Fig. 3-a, the desired SM range values are measured
    as a difference in percentual points, but irrigation systems need a correspondent
    volumetric water amount. Fig. 3-b converts those desired SM ranges in irrigation
    water depths ranges that should effectively be applied to the soil. A water depth,
    usually measured in , expresses a volumetric water content because it is defined
    as the height of a water column given a base area (in this case, ; in is equivalent
    to ). There are two mainstream ways to perform SM and WNE forecasts. The most
    traditional are the mechanistic approaches that use physical or empirical models,
    coupled or not to simulation techniques, to estimate or forecast values of interest
    (da Silva, et al., 2020). The other is machine learning approaches, covered in
    4.3 Feature engineering, 4.4 Data sourcing. 3. Interaction graph Multiple water
    need estimation (WNE) approaches are available in the literature. The choice depends
    on different factors, such as access to technologies, geographic region, and crops,
    which determine the irrigation system and constraint the applicability of some
    techniques (Jones et al., 2017, Liakos et al., 2018, Gallardo et al., 2020). Thus,
    we propose an interaction graph, which may be seen as a map of key topics and
    their interactions to organize the knowledge and facilitate the adoption of different
    WNE approaches. Fig. 4 shows the map organized as a graph, where the nodes represent
    topics in WNE and edges represent semantic relationships or dataflows that characterize
    dependencies among the topics. A natural flow starts from topics related to data
    sourcing (pink nodes) and moves towards the core process (black nodes), consisting
    of irrigation decision-making based on WNE. Intermediate topics are related to
    possible domain-knowledge feature engineering (blue nodes) and others related
    to WNE input key factors (grey nodes). Data quality is the only topic represented
    as a shaded area (yellow) rather than a node since it permeates nearly all topics,
    with increasing importance closer to the raw data. Download : Download high-res

    (WNE) – Interaction graph. From a practical standpoint, only the main interactions
    are depicted, reflecting conventional literature on the subject. However, any
    node in the graph could receive direct input from any other node before it. When
    using machine learning approaches, algorithms input raw data instead of data from
    domain-knowledge engineered features. In other words, signals from intermediate
    nodes are learned and reside inside the trained algorithms. 3.1. Core process
    The core process comprises the two most abstract topics in Fig. 4: WNE and irrigation
    decision-making. WNE is the final objective and can receive direct or indirect
    input from any grey, blue, and pink nodes. On the other hand, irrigation decision-making
    involves scheduling, which considers environmental and operational constraints
    (Gu, et al., 2020). In short, the water need is estimated at its current or future
    values by approaches relying on data from one or more WNE input key factors (Jones
    et al., 2017, Liakos et al., 2018, Gallardo et al., 2020). 3.2. Input Key-Factors
    The input key factors directly influence WNE, summarized into four topics: Soil
    Moisture (SM), Water Intake, Water Outtake, and Root Depth / Size. SM current
    values can be sensed by in situ sensors as soil probes or by remote sensors as
    satellites, and unnamed aerial vehicles (UAV, also known as drones) (Kashyap and
    Kumar, 2021, Mohanty et al., 2017, Vuran et al., 2018, García et al., 2020) and
    can be forecasted if we consider its time-series structure added to the influences
    of water intake and outtake forecasts (Cai et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2019, Shang
    et al., 2020). Information about soil water dynamics and soil water retention
    curve (SWRC) may be used to estimate SM''s future behavior, as it tells us how
    the soil reacts to water intake and outtake events (Jensen & Allen, 2016). Water
    intake comes from three sources: precipitation, capillary-rise from groundwater,
    and irrigation. The primary natural source is precipitation, which is also the
    most unpredictable in the short term. Water intake can be forecasted if we consider
    mostly precipitation probability and intensity coming from weather forecast providers.
    The forecast can be refined by considering capillary-rise effects due to groundwater
    mapping, soil properties, and SM time-series structure. Water outtake is primarily
    described by the evapotranspiration process. Also, root structure and dynamics
    help to refine evapotranspiration estimates and separate evaporation from transpiration
    effects. Water outtake forecast depends on weather and radiation forecast and,
    in the case of evapotranspiration crop coefficient approach, crop and environmental
    data. Root depth and size (dimensions and superficial area) can be statistically
    estimated for each crop, relying on its phenological stage, which is usually estimated
    by LAI, NDVI, and similar measurements (Ozier-Lafontaine and Bajazet, 2005, Aulen
    and Shipley, 2012). 3.3. Feature engineering Knowing soil properties is essential
    to determining water dynamics and building the soil water retention curve (SWRC),
    which is needed for SM studies (Jensen & Allen, 2016). The soil properties can
    be determined by agronomy lab tests and soil sensing. Remote sensing can provide
    slope and superficial temperature (Sishodia, et al., 2020), whereas soil probes
    can measure temperatures in many depths, thus providing a more precise temperature
    profiling (Jarman & Dimmock, 2018). Lab tests determine soil structure and biochemical
    characteristics (Rawls et al., 1991, Minasny and McBratney, 2018, Yu et al., 2018,
    Liu et al., 2020, Assouline, 2006). Meteorology concentrates on studying the weather
    in general, monitoring its current state and forecasting its short-term behavior
    (Delgoda, et al., 2016). Current and short-term events are the most important
    for precision irrigation purposes. Crop phenology studies and monitors crop development
    stages and health status (Gao, 2021). In short, LAI, NDVI, and plant water stress
    data (or similar ones) are processed to establish statistical relationships and
    models to understand crop development. For precision irrigation purposes, it is
    particularly important to estimate current and coefficients for the evapotranspiration
    crop coefficient approach (Jensen & Allen, 2016) and to provide models and statistics
    of root structure/dynamics and depth/size estimation (Ozier-Lafontaine and Bajazet,
    2005, Aulen and Shipley, 2012). Evapotranspiration focus on increasing estimates
    and forecast precision and seeks ways to better apply its methodologies to diverse
    crop situations (Feng, et al., 2016). As mentioned in section 2 (evapotranspiration
    part), surface energy balance and crop coefficient are the two most popular approaches.
    Hydrology monitors and studies hydrologic basins. In smart irrigation, we are
    particularly interested in groundwater mapping, monitoring, and forecasting (Hedley
    et al., 2013, Sahoo et al., 2017, Robert et al., 2018), as a critical water intake
    source in periods without precipitation. Models for soil water dynamics frequently
    use the amount of water and its depth to increase SM or WNE forecast performance.
    3.4. Data sourcing In smart irrigation, data can come from three primary sources:
    sensing, agronomy, and farm management (i.e., the farmer or the farm data management
    system). Sensing monitors the process variables, providing data in an appropriate
    spatial–temporal granularity for context-awareness and the resulting irrigation
    decisions (Jarman & Dimmock, 2018). As illustrated by Fig. 4, we can treat three
    types of sensing separately: remote sensing, in situ sensing, and weather stations.
    Remote sensing traditionally relies on satellites but recently UAVs are emerging
    as an alternative (Sishodia, et al., 2020). Satellite-based sensing captures data
    for the main topics of the WNE process: SM, crop-phenology (LAI, NDVI, and similar
    measurements), meteorology (air temperature ( ), radiation-relative measurements
    ( , , and ), relative humidity ( ), air pressure ( ), wind speed ( )), and hydrology
    (groundwater mapping). UAV-based sensing (Kim, et al., 2019) is a current hot
    research topic, providing a finer spatial resolution (from to -scale). In situ
    sensing (Kamienski et al., 2019, Vuran et al., 2018, García et al., 2020) can
    be divided into two types: fixed soil probes and mobile sensing. Soil probes usually
    can sense SM and soil temperatures in different depths and fine-grain temporal
    resolution ( -scale), having a high potential for accuracy and in-depth profiling
    among alternative technologies. On the other hand, mobile sensing uses equipment
    that moves through the farm in a specific vehicle or is embedded in farm work
    vehicles (e.g., tractors and harvesters). Mobile sensing typically uses image-based
    sensors, with the primary purpose of plant health assessment (e.g., diseases or
    water stress) and phenological stages (e.g., LAI) monitoring (Gupta, et al., 2021).
    In some rare cases of mobile sensing, radar equipment is also used to measure
    SM (Klotzsche, et al., 2018). Weather stations are the main source of weather
    data as air temperature ( ), radiation-relative measurements ( ), relative humidity
    ( ), air pressure (p), wind speed ( ), and precipitation (Sun, et al., 2021).
    Although a few large farms have weather stations inside them, most use data from
    a public or private service nearby. That explains why we did not classify weather
    stations as an in-situ sensing source, as the weather data may eventually differ
    from what happens in the farm (for instance, imagine that it rained where the
    station is, but not on the farm) (Sun, et al., 2021). Even when the weather station
    is located within the farm, distortions can still occur if the farm is large.
    The integration of data sensing with a geographic information system (GIS 8) (i.e.,
    latitude and longitude assigned to each sensor) through the assignment of latitude
    and longitude coordinates to each sensor creates opportunities for geostatistical
    analysis and data analytics. Farm management is also a data source, once it provides
    crop information (i.e., what is the crop, agronomic facts of that crop, when it
    started) and irrigation information (i.e., applied water depths, irrigation locations,
    and timestamps – not only irrigation decision-making but also effective irrigation
    data) (García, et al., 2020). 3.5. Data quality Data quality permeates data source
    topics, as all models and decision-making processes depend on available and reliable
    data. Bad raw data quality is detrimental to the topics in Fig. 4, and can cause
    error propagation all the way to the top objectives. In general, the main quality
    issues come from weather events (e.g., cloudiness), inserting noise in remote
    sensing (especially long-distance ones, such as satellite-based), and IoT communication
    and sensors failures and decalibration (Elijah, et al., 2018). As the future of
    precision irrigation relies on IoT technologies (soil probes and UAV), and one
    of the significant challenges of IoT is data quality, this subject should be central
    to researchers and practitioners. 4. The state of the art In this section, we
    aim to outline the most current and relevant literature pertaining to the Water
    Need Estimation (WNE) process, along with its key topics and recent research trends.
    We have contextualized and commented upon the references by dividing them into
    the following sub-sections: Water Need Estimation (WNE), Soil Moisture (SM) Estimation
    and Forecast, Feature Engineering, Data Sourcing, and Data Quality. Furthermore,
    for each sub-section, we have included Table A1, Table A2, Table A3, Table A4,
    Table A5 in Appendix A, which summarize and organize the references for convenient
    and expeditious future reference. 4.1. Water need estimation (WNE) This sub-section
    addresses traditional WNE approaches, application cases based the traditional
    approaches, and challenging ML approaches. Traditional approaches that cope with
    the problems by means of classic solutions are still mainstream (Jensen and Allen,
    2016, Allen et al., 2007, Pereira et al., 2020). FAO-56 consists of soil water
    balance (SWB) based on evapotranspiration (crop coefficient approach) and effective
    precipitation. The energy balance approach is also considered an alternative to
    the crop coefficient approach for evapotranspiration estimation. Furthermore,
    FAO-56 is compared to the transient state model (Richard''s equation) (Pereira,
    et al., 2020) that allows soil water processes to be accurately described mechanistically,
    e.g., infiltration and water redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation,
    and capillary rise (Pereira, et al., 2020). Also, they evaluate and discuss the
    influence of crop yield forecasts and performance indicators for irrigation scheduling.
    Typical application cases collect references of recent research based on traditional
    WNE approaches, showing they are still widely considered. Domínguez-Niño et al.
    (2020) use the standard FAO-56 approach to define the irrigation depth in an automated
    irrigation scheme and compare it to manual irrigation based on lysimeter water
    consumption. The automated method achieved similar or higher levels of water usage
    efficiency in all scenarios. Mechanistic approaches are also tested (Linker et
    al., 2016, Gu et al., 2017). Linker et al. (2016) use AquaCrop to simulate scenarios
    of water intake and consequent crop yield as an input to an irrigation scheduling
    optimization problem, for which the solution defines when to irrigate and the
    right amount of water. Gu et al. (2017) use a root zone water quality model (RZWQM2)
    to forecast crop water stress. Their irrigation timing was based on the occurrence
    of model-simulated water stress, while the irrigation depth was on the fraction
    of the SM deficit needed to replenish the field capacity at any given time. Modern
    irrigation scheduling methods are generally based on sensor-monitored soil moisture
    regimes rather than crop water stress. Crop water stress is difficult to measure
    in real time but can be computed using agricultural system models (Gu, et al.,
    2017). The challenging ML approaches deal with four issues: ML for improving water
    usage efficiency, big data enabling transfer learning, the importance of weather
    forecast for ML approaches, and the combination of mechanistic and ML modeling
    in a hybrid approach. Peng et al. (2019) develop an ML approach (back-propagation
    ANN) to water need forecast based on environmental data (SM, soil electrical conductivity,
    air temperature, and light intensity) to optimize irrigation water supply planning.
    Kashyap et al. (2021) use an ML approach (LSTM) to forecast SM in D + 1 based
    on IoT data and then spatially calculate the crop water need. Kurtulmuş et al.
    (2022) propose a data-driven water need estimation approach with three soil texture
    classes under different illumination conditions, using pre-trained deep convolutional
    neural networks applied to image processing. On big data enabled transfer learning
    (Pan & Yang, 2010), Veerachamy et al. (2021) proposed a Hadoop cloud-based big
    data environment to obtain soil moisture, temperature, humidity, wind speed and
    intensity from multiple farms. Since the high volume of data from several farms
    adds greater diversity of crop, soil type, locality, and climate, this big data
    configuration allows ML to be more comprehensive, enabling transfer learning:
    it is as if one crop could learn from others. Since unnecessary irrigation is
    usually applied to the field without considering the possible precipitation after
    irrigation, weather forecasts (e.g., precipitation) can save irrigation water
    (Cao, et al., 2019). Cai et al. (2011) add the weather forecast and its uncertainty
    in a simulation–optimization framework for WNE and irrigation scheduling, concluding
    that the forecast accuracy and the forecasting time horizon matter for water use
    efficiency. Cao et al. (2019) define and use three precipitation forecast levels
    to improve irrigation decision-making, thus avoiding excessive water use. Shang
    et al. (2020) combine mechanistic and ML modeling in a hybrid approach. The fundamental
    idea is to integrate the mechanistic models (describing dynamics in SM variations),
    and data-driven models (characterizing uncertainty in forecast errors of evapotranspiration
    and precipitation) into a single system. The hybrid approaches present relevant
    advantages in most scenarios. Traditional approaches are still relevant, but ML
    has been gaining traction, especially considering uncertainties. In this sense,
    adding weather forecast data (mainly precipitation) to ML approaches leads to
    performance leaps once it has valuable information to reduce future uncertainty.
    4.2. Soil moisture (SM) estimation and forecast This sub-section addresses SM
    estimation, SM forecast, and drought monitoring. Topp et al. (2008) review the
    mainstream problems and methods for SM and soil water dynamics. Kashyap et al.,
    2021, Bittelli, 2011, Beck et al., 2021 review SM estimation based on sensing,
    discussing the main metrics and techniques, and comparing them in terms of accuracy,
    advantages, challenges/risks, and cost. Satellite-based remote sensing is presented
    as SM products commonly available on the market (Mohanty, et al., 2017). SM estimation
    deals with additional intelligence layers to SM data, involving geostatistics
    and ML approaches. Barker et al. (2017) provide guidance on the number and placement
    of soil probes in the field with minimal cost, while keeping data quality at an
    acceptable level. Abowarda et al. (2021) deal with downscaling remote sensing
    data through interpolation and data fusion techniques. Alternative ML approaches
    cover the application of mainstream ML algorithms to scenarios with limited sensing
    data to estimate SM (Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2017, Filgueiras et al., 2020, Gu
    et al., 2021) such as Bayesian algorithms (Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2017) and ensembled
    multilayer perceptron (MLP) (Gu, et al., 2021). Comparisons were also made between
    the novel ML and the traditional mechanistic approaches, such as HYDRUS-2D and
    AquaCrop, revealing that ML is a valid alternative in a relevant part of the scenarios.
    Forecast involves novel ML approaches applied to pure data-driven contexts (Matei
    et al., 2017, Adeyemi et al., 2018, Cai et al., 2019, Anton et al., 2019a, Avram
    et al., 2020, Yu et al., 2021, Togneri et al., 2022) or their comparison with
    the traditional mechanistic approaches (Karandish and Šimůnek, 2016, Gumière et
    al., 2020). Karandish and Šimůnek (2016) propose a hybrid approach, considering
    both raw data and data from mechanistic models as inputs to ML. The authors use
    different ML algorithms, such as linear regression (LR), support vector machine
    (SVM), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    systems (ANFIS), deep learning regression network (DNNR), long short-term memory
    (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and convolutional neural network (CNN). All
    references used D + 1 9as a reference time horizon, except for one (Gumière, et
    al., 2020) that also used larger horizons, such as D + 3 and above. Matei et al.,
    2017, Anton et al., 2019a, and Avram et al. (2019, 2020) propose ML-based SM forecast
    primarily using weather data. Adeyemi et al., 2018, Cai et al., 2019, Yu et al.,
    2021 explore deep learning variants on structured data (weather and, sometimes,
    SM), finding good SM forecast accuracy. Togneri et al. (2022) test different ML
    algorithms (traditional and deep learning variants), and developed engineered
    features based on a modified autoencoder that allows a full data-driven approach,
    i.e., independent of domain-knowledge features. Their results are generalizable
    for 25% of the world’s arable land. Estimation and forecast approaches via ML
    share some common characteristics. Daily timeframe 10was adopted by all references,
    indicating this is the current mainstream approach for operational irrigation
    decision-making. The input data came from limited sensing scenarios including
    combinations of the following source options: remote sensing (satellite, UAV),
    weather station, and mechanistic models. Soil probes are not included in the ML
    estimation task because their objective is SM estimation in the absence of direct
    measurements. Forecast applications use soil probes and weather forecast providers
    as additional data sources. Drought monitoring supports SM estimation and forecast
    as drought indexes are relevant features for them (Narasimhan & Srinivasan, 2005).
    This situation happens because the behavior of soil water dynamics varies if there
    is water surplus or not: e.g., in drought periods, deeper soil layers cannot supply
    root zone with water without precipitation. As we can observe, ML is a trend due
    to the popularization of IoT. Pure data-driven approaches are being compared to
    traditional mechanistic approaches or even being mixed with them in the so-called
    hybrid approaches. 4.3. Feature engineering This sub-section addresses crop phenology,
    meteorology, evapotranspiration, groundwater, soil properties, and soil water
    dynamics. Jensen and Allen, 2016, GAO, 2021 overview crop phenology, with special
    attention to its characterization and mapping. Crop development is characterized
    by the description and evaluation of two traditional methods, AquaCrop (a mechanistic
    approach) (Kulbacki, et al., 2018) and the empirical growing-degree days (McMaster
    & Wilhelm, 1997). Jafari et al. (2021) show and compare methods for evapotranspiration
    crop coefficient estimation. Virnodkar et al. (2020) use remote sensing and ML
    to determine crop water stress. Root size estimation is detailed in two soil sensing
    methods: impedance spectroscopy (Ozier-Lafontaine & Bajazet, 2005) and electrical
    capacitance (Aulen & Shipley, 2012). Finally, Perez-Sanz et al. (2017) discuss
    IoT approaches and the impact of image data acquisition issues on crop phenology
    measurements. Also, Fan et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2021 propose a complete IoT-based
    platform to acquire and process data to determine crop phenotype and phenology.
    In this context, meteorology focuses on short-term planning, via the impact of
    the weather forecast on irrigation considering natural water outtake (primarily
    by evapotranspiration) and intake (by precipitation). In this sense, Delgoda et
    al. (2016) estimate the importance of weather forecast data using the AquaCrop
    simulation model. Evapotranspiration is organized into traditional and ML approaches.
    For traditional approaches, Allen et al. (1998) is the classical report for the
    standard FAO-56 11approach, about the evapotranspiration crop coefficient approach
    coupled with the reference evapotranspiration calculated by the Penman-Monteith
    method. In addition, they introduce alternative evapotranspiration methods, such
    as the energy-balance ones. Jensen and Allen, 2016, Pereira et al., 2021 refresh
    Allen et al. (1998) and can be considered the current most up-to-date references
    in evapotranspiration. For ML approaches, the references have two focuses: estimation
    and forecast. For estimation, ML algorithms 12were tested in limited sensing data
    scenarios and compared against physical/empirical models 13(Feng et al., 2016,
    Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020, Fan et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2021). Many ML algorithms
    showed performance similar to FAO-56 and other traditional benchmarks, for daily
    reference evapotranspiration (Feng, et al., 2016) and daily crop evapotranspiration
    (Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020, Fan et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2021). For the forecast,
    Afzaal et al., 2020, Torres et al., 2011 propose daily evapotranspiration forecasting
    for D + 1 using ML algorithms14, reaching performance comparable to mechanistic
    approaches based on physical/empirical models. Groundwater research areas focus
    on mapping, monitoring, and forecasting the groundwater levels. Recent studies
    rely on ML approaches to overcome traditional mechanistic groundwater dynamics
    models for studying groundwater and extracting useful information. Sahoo et al.
    (2017) use MLP (multilayer perceptron) to forecast changes in groundwater level
    when subsurface soil properties are unknown, only based on remote and weather
    sensing. Hedley et al. (2013) compare MLM (multiple linear regression model) and
    RF (random forest) regressors to estimate water table depth and SM at 50 cm using
    electromagnetic survey data, a rainfall time series, and a wetness index. An important
    conclusion is the confirmation of a relevant dependence of SM on groundwater level.
    Robert et al. (2018) analyze groundwater adaptation to climate change, providing
    a dynamic programming approach to groundwater irrigation forecasting. Soil properties
    area is organized into two subareas: properties measurements and supplementation.
    Near real-time temperature is obtained by in situ sensing, with soil structure
    and biochemical characteristics usually obtained by in situ or lab agronomy tests.
    Sishodia et al. (2020) present a comparative analysis of remote sensing (satellite
    and UAV) equipment and metrics to address soil slope and surface temperature profiling.
    Jarman and Dimmock (2018) address in situ sensing options (soil probes and ground
    penetrating radar - GPR) as tools to measure the soil temperature profile. Rawls
    et al. (1991), Minasny et al. (2018), and Assouline (2006) relate soil structure
    and biochemical characteristics to its hydraulic behavior, allowing methods for
    defining the soil water retention curve (SWRC) or improving its precision. Montzka
    et al. (2017) bring a global dataset of soil hydraulic properties to develop approaches
    for soil dynamics when no soil data is available. Finally, Yu et al., 2018, Obia
    et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020 show possible soil supplementation to retain water
    for longer periods using plastic film, biochar and an absorbent polymer. Soil
    water dynamics area involves problems and methods, soil water balance (SWB), soil
    water retention curve (SWRC), and computational implementation. Carminati et al.
    (2010) conduct a laboratory experiment presenting observational aspects of soil
    water dynamics. Jensen and Allen (Jensen & Allen, 2016) review mainstream models
    of soil water dynamics, focusing on the SWB approach based on crop coefficient
    evapotranspiration (the so-called FAO-56 SWB approach). Pereira et al. (2020)
    deploy the FAO-56 Soil Water Balance (SWB) approach as an algorithm to work as
    a soil water dynamics simulator and discussed alternative soil water dynamics
    approaches. Toumi et al. (2016) adapt their study to the AquaCrop approach. Montzka
    et al. (2017) address the Soil Water Retention Curve (SWRC), bringing a global
    dataset of soil hydraulic properties. Bittelli et al. (2015) work with computational
    approaches, for soil properties and dynamics implemented in Python. 4.4. Data
    sourcing A critical issue in collecting data for WNE is finding the most cost-effective
    source, influenced by several aspects, such as crop, locality, climate, and irrigation
    type. This sub-section addresses sensing, remote sensing, satellite-based remote
    sensing, UAV-based remote sensing, in situ sensing, mobile sensing, GIS/geostatistics,
    and agronomy/labs. Sensing is an area subject to various studies over the years.
    Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Talaviya et al., 2020 present different types of sensing
    applied to agriculture and irrigation. There are also references to subareas,
    such as remote sensing (Sishodia et al., 2020, GAO, 2021, Alvino and Marino, 2017,
    Jung et al., 2021), in situ sensing (Vuran et al., 2018, Rehman et al., 2014)
    and mobile sensing (Gupta et al., 2021, Smith et al., 2018). Remote sensing can
    be divided into satellite-based (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Sozzi et al., 2018)
    and UAV-based (Kim et al., 2019, Adão et al., 2017, Hunt and Daughtry, 2018, de
    Oca and Flores, 2021) sensing. Some references focus on irrigation, whereas others
    delve into specific irrigation subareas, such as SM (Kashyap and Kumar, 2021,
    Mohanty et al., 2017, Bittelli, 2011, Beck et al., 2021), and crop phenology monitoring
    (Carlson & Ripley, 1997). A particular trend across references is the investigation
    of architectural and implementation aspects of IoT solutions in the farm to support
    sensing (Kamienski et al., 2019, Vuran et al., 2018, García et al., 2020, Rehman
    et al., 2014, Saha et al., 2018), their impact on data collection, and its usefulness
    as data sources. Another trend is the use of machine learning (ML)15 for computer
    vision, i.e., image post-processing that increases the accuracy of the captured
    data (noise cleaning) or data enrichment in order to provide additional information
    and valuable insights for the farmer (Gupta et al., 2020, Rehman et al., 2019,
    Ampatzidis et al., 2020). When data sensing is integrated with a geographic information
    system (GIS), several opportunities open up (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Barker
    et al., 2017): (i) Data visualization: It is possible to generate maps of the
    farm, with the variables of interest represented in a spatially distributed way,
    facilitating the generation of insights for decision-making (Jarman & Dimmock,
    2018).; (ii) Downscaling (data inference): Applying geostatistics to GIS data
    allows inferring variables values among sensor data points through interpolation
    and regression methods. Thus, we can use a minimum number of sensors strategically
    placed (Dursun & Özden, 2017) for in situ sensing or a minimum spatial resolution
    for remote sensing. This downscaling approach allows for more spatial accurate
    agricultural treatments and also works in univariate and multivariate problems,
    considering variables from different data sources and resolutions for each inferred
    variable in space (Abowarda, et al., 2021).; (c) Increase of in situ sensing data
    quality robustness: When a specific soil probe decalibrates or fails, these issues
    can be identified through anomaly detection relative to expected sensor values.
    Moreover, non-reliable data can be replaced by the inferred ones (Anand, et al.,
    2021). Sun et al. (2021) address the use of GIS and geostatistics in agriculture,
    whereas Abowarda et al., 2021, Anand et al., 2021 focus on irrigation. The main
    techniques involve interpolation, downscaling, and the fusion of multiple sources,
    possibly from different timeframes and localities. Barker et al. (2017) approach
    the problem of deciding how many and where to place soil moisture probes based
    on geostatistics. Lastly, related to agronomy and laboratory subjects, van Genuchten
    (1980) presents the mainstream method for soil water retention curve (SWRC) determination.
    Fig. 5 summarizes the matching of data sources to data categories, structured
    in layers. The inner layer denotes the smart irrigation field, comprising precision
    irrigation, traditional approaches, modern IoT, and data-driven applications.
    The middle layer carries the data categories often useful for precision irrigation
    (Kamienski et al., 2019, García et al., 2020). Finally, the outermost layer brings
    the corresponding data sources, ranked in their suitability as preferred (most
    used), challenger and alternative. Download : Download high-res image (239KB)

    Suitability summary. Satellites remain the preferred data source for data categories
    that accept coarser spatial–temporal resolutions (30–100-meter grid and daily
    are the most granular). The use of open or paid satellite data is cost-effective
    for data categories immutable in the season (such as soil slope/topology) or relatively
    stable ones (such as phenological stages16, plant water stress17 and groundwater
    mapping) (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Sishodia et al., 2020, GAO, 2021, Alvino and
    Marino, 2017, Jung et al., 2021, Carlson and Ripley, 1997). A relevant limitation
    of satellites is spatial–temporal resolution sparsity (Sishodia, et al., 2020):
    satellites commonly cover the same area with -scale intervals and -scale spatial
    resolution, which are considerably coarser than modern IoT sensing technologies,
    as UAV and in situ sensing-based technologies. Satellite-based sensing is more
    susceptible to data quality issues primarily due to clouds, precipitation, or
    other weather events that partially cover the ground images or distort radiation
    signals (Jarman & Dimmock, 2018). UAVs are challengers due to better spatial–temporal
    resolution and less susceptibility to data quality issues. Also, UAV sensing is
    less susceptible to data quality problems because they fly below the clouds, and
    farmers can use them only when the weather is clean. Furthermore, farmers can
    choose the desired temporal resolution once they own or manage the physical UAV
    in the farm. On the other hand, UAVs have a higher cost and greater need for in
    situ maintenance and handling (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Sishodia et al., 2020,
    GAO, 2021, Kim et al., 2019, Alvino and Marino, 2017, Jung et al., 2021, Hunt
    and Daughtry, 2018). Regarding the measurement of leaf area index (LAI), mobile
    sensing is also positioned as a challenger, whenever sensors can be embedded in
    agricultural vehicles and for travelling the crop area with adequate frequency
    (Gupta et al., 2020, Gupta et al., 2021). Weather stations are preferred but also
    costly way to collect weather data. Alternatively, data can usually be obtained
    free of charge or at low cost (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Vuran et al., 2018, Talaviya
    et al., 2020, Alvino and Marino, 2017). Free or low-cost satellite services are
    popular alternatives, with similar data quality (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Sishodia
    et al., 2020, GAO, 2021, Alvino and Marino, 2017, Sozzi et al., 2018). Weather
    forecasts are often acquired from specific providers (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018,
    Cai et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2019, Shang et al., 2020, Alvino and Marino, 2017).
    Soil probes are the current preferred sources to measure soil moisture and temperature,
    providing high spatial–temporal resolution, high accuracy, and different soil
    depths (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Kashyap and Kumar, 2021, Alvino and Marino,
    2017, Bittelli, 2011, Beck et al., 2021). However, this high accuracy depends
    on sensor calibration. For example, the mapping of indirect measurements, such
    as soil matric potential [ ], to SM may differ depending on soil properties –
    each management zone 18has its own soil water retention curve (SWRC), i.e., a
    unique sensor calibration curve (Van Genuchten, 1980). Data quality is a central
    issue here (Togneri, et al., 2019). In addition to requiring precise calibration,
    sensors may lose their calibration over time, either by the equipment deterioration
    or by a change in the soil characteristics. In addition, in large fields, soil
    probes are located in places difficult to access for maintenance, which makes
    the data quality issue a considerable risk. There are also data collection failures
    due to communication problems between sensing equipment and other components lying
    in the path between sensors and the database, or even due to battery problems.
    The spatial resolution is a positive point since as many soil probes as necessary
    can be installed in the form of grids or one (or more, for redundancy) in each
    management zone (Dursun & Özden, 2017). UAVs become challengers to soil probes
    due to the limitations of the latter concerning calibration and in situ maintenance
    for extensive crops. UAVs achieve reasonable accuracy levels, cover large areas
    of difficult access, and do not require calibration. On the other hand, the main
    disadvantage of UAVs is a limited temporal resolution, as they do not continuously
    fly over the crops and thus cannot capture data for intraday behavior profiling
    (Jarman and Dimmock, 2018, Kim et al., 2019, Alvino and Marino, 2017, Adão et
    al., 2017, Hunt and Daughtry, 2018). Satellite services appear as an alternative,
    generally less costly and with coarser spatial–temporal resolution (Jarman and
    Dimmock, 2018, Kashyap and Kumar, 2021, Mohanty et al., 2017, Alvino and Marino,
    2017, Bittelli, 2011, Beck et al., 2021). In situ or laboratory agronomic procedures
    are still the mainstream data sources for the discovery and mapping of soil properties
    (Van Genuchten, 1980, Rawls et al., 1991, Minasny and McBratney, 2018, Assouline,
    2006, Montzka et al., 2017) (Fig. 5). In contrast, in general, UAV and satellite-based
    sensing are alternatives, within a full data-driven setup (Sishodia, Ray, & Singh,
    2020). 4.5. Data quality Data quality permeates all data sources as models and
    decision-making processes depend on available and reliable data. Bad raw data
    quality is detrimental to the topics in Fig. 4, potentially causing error propagation
    to the top objectives. In general, the main quality issues come from weather events
    (e.g., cloudiness) inserting noise in remote sensing (especially long-distance
    ones, such as satellite-based) and IoT communication and sensors failures and
    decalibration (Elijah, et al., 2018). The two mainstream issues for IoT-based
    agriculture are data unavailability and unreliability. Data unavailability can
    be caused by sensor damage or communication failures, both due to IoT equipment
    being subject to environmental conditions, being often in places of difficult
    access for maintenance, and even to energy sourcing problems (e.g., battery autonomy)
    (Togneri et al., 2019a, Avram et al., 2020). Data unreliability also occurs when
    sensors are exposed to environmental conditions (Togneri et al., 2019a, Avram
    et al., 2020). As applications in agriculture, Matei et al. (2017) add context
    data publicly available from web portals to local data, provided by weather stations
    to forecast SM, proving that quantity and quality of context data are essential
    to prediction accuracy. Anton et al., 2019a, Anton et al., 2019b advocate that
    multiple data sources can improve ML reliability and accuracy on temperature and
    SM. Avram et al. (2019) showed that context modeling could add helpful information
    to SM forecasts improving accuracy by 30%. Avram et al. (2020) evaluate the influence
    of data quality in SM forecast, investigating the impact of context completeness
    and accuracy over SM forecasting. Experiments with different noise levels and
    missing data using different ML algorithms show that the SM forecast performance
    is improved when using data quality context awareness (data quality metrics),
    even if the quality standards are not completely met. Moon et al., 2018, Torres
    et al., 2020 work on techniques for improving sensor data quality. Moon et al.
    (2018) perform spatial–temporal data compression techniques and data fidelity
    evaluation for IoT in smart farms. Torres et al. (2020) propose a multilevel data
    fusion approach that includes sensor data (low level), events and decisions based
    on sensor data (medium level), and decisions based on multiple applications (high
    level). The main goal is to find ways to use sensor data quality techniques accordingly
    to application target events, seeking to optimize decision-making. Togneri et
    al. (2019a) evaluate multi-sourcing and context-awareness importance to data quality
    assurance for IoT sensing. The paper exposes the problems with IoT data quality
    and proposes multi-sourcing and context-awareness as solutions to identify non-veracious
    data. Dursun et al. (2017) address soil probe placement as a way of seeking to
    maximize data quality while minimizing the number of soil probes (it minimizes
    costs as well). Optimization techniques (genetic algorithms) are used to place
    the right number of soil probes, in the right place, to measure SM. Context awareness
    tries to improve data quality by heterogeneous multi-sourcing. Ardagna et al.
    (2018) expose the problems and potentialities of dealing with heterogeneous data
    sources and propose ways of addressing them. Furthermore, they use data quality
    metrics as variables to data models and show ways to choose adequate data quality
    assessment techniques according to modeling objectives. Bertossi et al. (2020)
    propose using ML to context-aware data quality in terms of explainability and
    causality. Moreover, the paper suggests that ontology could be another important
    tool for context-aware data quality. Albertoni et al. (2021) propose a particular
    ontology for context-aware data quality. Ismael et al. (2021) establish a solution
    to sensor-based data sourcing conflict in the data fusion process. Regarding data
    veracity, Hariri et al. (2019) focus on data quality issues. The authors characterize
    data veracity as a multi-dimensional problem, i.e., data coming from multiple
    variables and data sources helping to identify related issues. The paper compares
    uncertainty treatments: probability theory, Bayesian theory, Shannon''s entropy,
    fuzziness, belief function, rough set theory and classification entropy. Belaud
    et al. (2019) establish a big data architecture to deal with multidimensionality
    for the agriculture context. Bahi et al., 2019, Junior and Kamienski, 2021 also
    highlight data veracity among data quality issues but characterizing veracity
    in the context of IoT (exploiting mainly sensors and communication fault-tolerance
    aspect, and data fusion). The paper proposes an IoT framework to optimize data
    availability / veracity and discusses related challenges. Armina et al. (2017)
    review the mainstream approaches for data imputation, comparing algorithms and
    application cases and also review its importance and metrics. Murray (2018) shows
    how to evaluate when imputation algorithms work or not for multiple-dimension
    data. Fang et al. (2020) compare and evaluate the current main multiple time-series
    imputation algorithms, as GRU-D, GRUI-GAN, BRITS, E2GAN and NAOMI, including hybrid
    approaches. 5. Discussion Data-driven machine learning-based approaches have emerged
    primarily in two key topics: Soil Moisture (SM) estimation/forecast and Water
    Need Estimation (WNE). The fast development of IoT technologies has been providing
    abundant and fine-grained spatial and temporal data, thus favoring data-driven
    approaches (Miranda et al., 2019, Lezoche et al., 2020, Goldstein et al., 2018).
    Furthermore, SM estimation/forecast and WNE are the key inputs to the ultimate
    goal of estimating the amount of water that needs to be applied by the irrigation
    system. Current research challenges focus on using supervised machine learning
    to replace mechanistic approaches to SM estimation/forecast and WNE in the case
    of a partial lack of data (Karandish & Šimůnek, 2016). Efforts in this area typically
    use hybrid approaches that combine data collected from sensors (physical and virtual)
    and domain-knowledge-engineered features coming from physical-empirical models.
    There is an ongoing trend for the literature to focus on the hybrid approaches
    to SM estimation (Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2017, Filgueiras et al., 2020, Gu et
    al., 2021), SM forecast (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Cai et al., 2019, Yu et al., 2021,
    Gumière et al., 2020) and WNE (Kashyap and Kumar, 2021, Cai et al., 2011, Cao
    et al., 2019, Shang et al., 2020, Peng et al., 2019, Veerachamy and Ramar, 2021).
    Actually, latest developments prioritize sensor data over physical-empirical models,
    making machine learning (ML) approaches better suited. Various studies propose
    SM forecast based only on weather data, introducing context awareness to enable
    full data-driven approaches (Matei et al., 2017, Anton et al., 2019a, Avram et
    al., 2019, Avram et al., 2020). Togneri et al. (2022) propose a full data-driven
    approach for SM forecast, independent of domain-knowledge features and only based
    on data from soil probes and weather stations. Their strategy is also based on
    context awareness, due to a feature engineering process by a modified autoencoder
    architecture. Considering the geographical span of the farms analyzed, their results
    are generalizable for 25% of the world’s arable land. Kurtulmuş et al. (2022)
    propose a full data-driven approach for WNE using deep convolutional neural networks
    in three soil texture classes under different illumination conditions. Extrapolating
    the full data-driven approaches to their limit, one can see a contrast that clearly
    highlights the potential advantages and challenges among the alternatives. As
    full data-driven approaches prove effective, solutions become independent of domain
    knowledge from physical-empirical models that often have limited geographic-climatic
    validity and require human intervention. Thus, ML-based approaches can be more
    flexible and adaptable to the most diverse geographic and climatic contexts and
    learn from various regional data. More than that, we believe there is a potential
    for transfer learning (Weiss et al., 2016, Risheh et al., 2020, Abdallah et al.,
    2021, Chen et al., 2021), as the patterns learned from a group of farms, crops,
    regions, and climates around the world can be applied in a new application with
    a distinct configuration. In this case, transfer learning addresses the cold-start
    challenge of ML-based data-driven approaches, i.e., learning from other contexts
    requires only a low volume of local data to adapt the model to multiple conditions
    and geographies. In essence, we could quickly produce models with adequate accuracy
    in a very short time. Figs. 6 adapts 4 to represent hypothetical full data-driven
    approaches of our future exercise and the schematic evolution from the current
    landscape. Note that data can be directly consumed by SM estimation/forecast and
    WNE tasks, which essentially are supervised ML processes relying on historical
    behavior, forecast of weather and precipitation. Naturally, the feedback loop
    from Irrigation Decision-Making points directly to SM estimation/forecast and
    WNE ML processes. Download : Download high-res image (391KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Hypothetical full data-driven approach for Water Need
    Estimation (WNE) – Interaction graph. However, there are substantial challenges
    to data-driven approaches. The biggest one is sensing data quality since data-driven
    techniques usually do not perform satisfactorily when not applied to abundant
    and reliable data (Togneri et al., 2019a, Avram et al., 2020, Goodfellow et al.,
    2015, Géron, 2019). In this way, data-driven techniques are more sensitive to
    data problems than mechanistic approaches, often based on more fundamental and
    aggregated data (e.g., weather station data) and, therefore, less prone to problems.
    A current challenge is that data-driven WNE techniques require low-granularity
    data generated by soil probes to obtain adequate accuracy. The downside is that
    the soil probe data is typically the most susceptible to quality issues, such
    as availability and reliability (Togneri et al., 2019a, Karkouch et al., 2016,
    Teh et al., 2020). In such a scenario, data quality management (which, for Fig.
    6, remains represented by the yellow shaded area, as in Fig. 4) has even greater
    importance for a prospective data-driven approach. The development of more robust
    IoT solutions and the deployment of data sourcing redundancy can substantially
    help with data availability issues (Togneri et al., 2019b, Junior and Kamienski,
    2021, Ardagna et al., 2018). Coming to ML, multiple time-series imputation techniques
    (Cao et al., 2018, Luo et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2019, Singh et al., 2019, Yildiz
    et al., 2019, Luo et al., 2019) can also be helpful against data unavailability,
    and anomaly detection techniques. (Chandola et al., 2012, Liu et al., 2012, Akoglu
    et al., 2015, Chalapathy and Chawla, 2019, Ruff et al., 2019, Amarbayasgalan et
    al., 2020, Srikanth et al., 2020, Erhan et al., 2021) can be useful to detect
    unreliable data. 6. Conclusion The rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) allowed
    higher spatial–temporal resolution data for agriculture applications. Precision
    irrigation and IoT-based data-driven approaches usher in the smart irrigation
    (SI) era. SI contributes to our society in three significant ways. First, it achieves
    substantial gains in water use efficiency, reducing energy costs to pump water.
    Second, it reduces the environmental footprint since drinking water is increasingly
    becoming scarce. Third, it can increase crop productivity, thus becoming allied
    for guaranteeing food security. Water need estimation (WNE) is a core component
    of SI, known to be a complex process, composed of many key topics and countless
    approaches. We identified a vast literature on modern approaches, but, to the
    best of our knowledge, none allow a holistic technical view that integrates all
    key topics and serve as a map of possibilities. This paper aims to provide an
    overview of water need estimation (WNE) for IoT-based smart irrigation that both
    researchers and practitioners may benefit from. We first reviewed the background
    and developed intuition about the whole process (section 2). Then we generated
    a graph-shaped map to understand the key topics and how they interconnect, creating
    awareness about existing approaches, from sensing technologies (e.g., IoT) to
    WNE delivery (section 3). Next, we pointed out papers with the most current view
    on the WNE process, on all relevant key topics, and on recent research trends
    (section 4). Finally, we discussed trends in WNE and offered our vision for the
    future (section 5). Our main contributions are threefold: (i) an interaction graph
    as a tool for understanding the big picture of water need estimation; (ii) a mapping
    of the main recent works by area and subarea, which extends the interaction graph;
    and (iii) our understanding of trends and indications for future work. Our findings
    point to the rise of data-driven approaches, mainly using supervised machine learning
    (ML) (4 The state of the art, 5 Discussion). Hybrid approaches are increasingly
    common, sitting between traditional domain knowledge and ML-based data-driven
    techniques. Further, we identified efforts to make WNE independent of domain-knowledge
    methods, which have limited climatic and geographic scope. Also, there are a variety
    of efforts to leverage full data-driven approaches, presumably more flexible to
    any context. We also realize that the adoption of data-driven approaches is directly
    conditioned by IoT data quality solutions and the cost-effectiveness of available
    data sources (4 The state of the art, 5 Discussion). Based on our insights in
    Section 5, we suggest two lines of further work. First, to advance the development
    of machine learning-based approaches for soil moisture (SM) estimation/forecast
    and WNE, being hybrid or full data-driven, and to compare them to traditional
    domain-knowledge methods. Second, to develop solutions to improve data quality,
    such as robust IoT architectures (e.g., same-type sensor redundancy, data sourcing
    redundancy) to treat data unavailability, machine learning methods (ML) like multiple
    time-series imputation to treat data unavailability, and multiple dimension anomaly
    monitoring to treat data unreliability. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    is the total energy that is available to influence the weather. Energy comes in
    the system when sunlight penetrates the top of the atmosphere. 6 Heat flux ( )
    is the thermal energy transferred from a given surface (in our case, the ground
    / crop surface). 7 Sensible heat flux ( ) is the exchange of heat by a thermodynamic
    body (in our case, the ground / crop surface) that makes the body temperature
    change but leaves certain other macroscopic variables of the body unchanged, such
    as volume or pressure. 8 GIS is a set of systems capable of producing, storing,
    processing, analyzing, and representing information referenced on geographic space,

    Delfiner, 2009). 9 In time-series, D+1 means a day ahead. The first character,
    D, means the daily timeframe is considered. The second character, +, means that
    the time reference is in the future (- would be in the past). And the third character,
    1, means the difference of one day from the present time. As a result, D+2 means
    two days ahead, D+3 three days ahead, and so on. 10 In time-series, the timeframe
    is the periodicity in which you choose to aggregate data, valid for both historical
    and future data. Therefore, a daily timeframe means that data is aggregated by
    day. 11 FAO: Food and Agriculture Organization for the United Nations (FAO, 2021).

    Full Text Preview 1. Introduction Water scarcity has evolved into one of the major
    and critical issues of the 21st century, owing to an insanely increasing water
    demand versus water supply (Veldkamp et al., 2017). Water unavailability affects
    more geographical regions than others, owing to the variability in temperature
    patterns and uneven distribution of precipitation (van Vliet et al., 2017; Coffel
    et al., 2019). Climate change and global warming are only worsening the case,
    since statistical and predictive models indicate extreme water-related events
    for the next one hundred years to come (Brown et al., 2019). Water is at the core
    of requisite fields like agriculture (Markland et al., 2018). Seventy percent
    of all water withdrawals are consumed by agriculture, which is justified toward
    securing food and crop productivity, for instance (Mabhaudhi et al., 2018). However,
    only 2.5% represents the globe’s freshwater, two-thirds of which is inaccessible
    (Qadri et al., 2020) (Figure 1). For the above-mentioned reasons, managing water
    use and assuring sustainable agriculture is of the highest importance (Hoekstra,
    2017). Figure 1. The disposition of water on Earth Source: Adapted from Shiklomanov
    (1991) During the past few decades, advanced computational tools, such as Artificial
    Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Machine-Learning have been
    gaining momentum (Liakos et al., 2018; Jha et al., 2019; Antony et al., 2020).
    In recent times, advances regarding in situ features have revolutionized our understanding
    of complicated issues like those related to water (Doorn, 2021). These powerful
    human-set tools have been reported for their time-efficient, data-generation,
    and decision-making roles (Tien, 2017). AI relies on simulating human intelligence
    on an automated basis. Thus, AI as a branch of computer science that can recognize
    its environment should be able to contribute towards improving machine labor and
    the development of more advanced technologies, including Convolutional Neural
    Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Machine-Learning (Currie and
    Rohren, 2021). IoT is a network of physical items with integrated technology that
    enable communication and internal sensing (Antony et al., 2020). It represents
    an ensemble of physical items that can link and share data like software, hardware,
    and sensors (Sadique et al., 2018). Thus, the complete automated scheme acts apprehensively
    and reacts in accordance. Since there is a limited supply of fresh water on Earth,
    using it reasonably is the main purpose (Kamienski et al., 2019). Thus, AI, IoT,
    and Machine-Learning can automate practices related to irrigation and optimizing
    crop growth and productivity. Nevertheless, challenging aspects that hinder switching
    to precision agriculture are the need for trained agriculture stakeholders like
    farmers, crop consultants, and advisors (Patrício and Rieder, 2018). Another issue
    is the non-uniformity of agricultural lands and crop types, which makes coming
    up with practical smart irrigation setups a challenging mission (Kassim, 2020).
    Therefore, the present book chapter surveys a selection of the recent advances
    in technologies powered by AI, IoT, and machine-based, as well as their applications
    for modern irrigation and precision agriculture. Furthermore, research gaps and
    challenging issues related to these technologies are addressed. Continue Reading

  description: Global drylands, covering about 41% of Earth’s surface and inhabited
    by 38% of the world’s population, are facing the stark challenges of water scarcity,
    low water productivity, and food insecurity. This paper highlights the major constraints
    to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods, and associated
    challenges, efforts, and progress to enhance water use efficiency (WUE), conserve
    water, and guarantee food security by overviewing different smart irrigation approaches.
    Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods (based on weather, plant,
    and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important information needed for precise
    irrigation, which leads to over- or under-irrigation of fields. On the other hand,
    by using several factors, including soil and climate variation, soil properties,
    plant responses to water deficits, and changes in weather factors, smart irrigation
    can drive better irrigation decisions that can help save water and increase yields.
    Various smart irrigation approaches, such as artificial intelligence and deep
    learning (artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent
    system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, variable rate
    irrigation (VRI) technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ensure
    high water use efficiency in water-scarce regions. These smart irrigation technologies
    can improve water management and accelerate the progress in achieving multiple
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where no one gets left behind.

    of water scarcity, low water productivity, and food insecurity. This paper highlights
    the major constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling
    methods, and associated challenges, efforts, and progress to enhance water use
    efficiency (WUE), conserve water, and guarantee food security by overviewing different
    smart irrigation approaches. Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods
    (based on weather, plant, and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important
    information needed for precise irrigation, which leads to over- or under-irrigation
    of fields. On the other hand, by using several factors, including soil and climate
    variation, soil properties, plant responses to water deficits, and changes in
    weather factors, smart irrigation can drive better irrigation decisions that can
    help save water and increase yields. Various smart irrigation approaches, such
    as artificial intelligence and deep learning (artificial neural network, fuzzy
    logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive
    irrigation systems, variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology, and unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) could ensure high water use efficiency in water-scarce regions.
    These smart irrigation technologies can improve water management and accelerate
    the progress in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where
    no one gets left behind. Keywords: drylands; food insecurity; irrigation management;
    smart irrigation; sustainable development goals; water scarcity 1. Introduction
    Drylands (hyper-arid, arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid parts) occupy 41% of Earth’s
    surface, supporting 38% of global population [1,2]. Agriculture and pastoralism
    are the major livelihood sources for most of the population, largely dependent
    upon natural resources [3]. About 70% of the world’s drylands exist in developing
    countries where people are confronting the stark challenge of poverty, food insecurity,
    malnourishment, poor economic conditions, and marginalization [4,5]. Water availability
    and agricultural productivity are the most pressing issues associated with drylands
    and land degradation [6]. Globally, water scarcity is already affecting 1–2 billion
    people, and a majority of them are concentrated in drylands, where the supply
    of water is insufficient to meet the user demands [7]. Future climate projections
    also suggest that in coming decades more people will be facing huge shortages
    of water. Consequently, climate change and water management decisions will adversely
    affect drylands and their inhabitants [8]. As global population is increasing
    rapidly, agricultural productivity in drylands needs improvement to meet food
    security demands. Therefore, adopting smart irrigation approaches is a viable
    option to better utilize the available water resources and improve water productivity
    in drylands. Water scarcity has become one of the critical issues and threatens
    the sustainable development in drylands [9]. Water scarcity occurs when water
    demand becomes equal or even exceeds the total available fresh water resources
    [10]. Water scarcity should be considered from both physical and economic perspectives
    [11]. Physical water scarcity has two aspects: green water scarcity (soil moisture
    in root zone is insufficient to meet crop water demands), and blue water scarcity
    (both surface and ground water availability is unable to meet human water needs)
    [12]. The economic water scarcity occurs when water resources are physically available,
    but lack of institutional capacity and socioeconomic conditions limit the use
    of that water [13]. Water scarcity negatively impacts social integrity and sustainable
    economic development, especially in drylands. The primary sector, which is seriously
    affected, is agriculture, utilizing more than 80% of total fresh water [14]. Intensification
    of agricultural water scarcity could affect food production and threaten food
    security in drylands in the future [15]. Further, it may seriously impact the
    associated Sustainable Development Goals of SDG-2 (Zero hunger), SDG-6 (Clean
    water), SDG-7 (Clean and affordable energy), SDG 15.3 (Desertification control)
    and SDG-14 (Life below water), which are directly or indirectly dependent on water
    availability [16,17]. Since the available water resources are limited and to obtain
    more yields with less water use, efficient management of available water with
    improved water productivity is direly needed to meet future food demands [18].
    Managing irrigation efficiently is challenging in drylands because there are so
    many factors to take into account, such as crop type, climate, soil type, and
    irrigation methods [19]. Drylands are characterized by high potential evapotranspiration,
    low and erratic rainfall and high temperature [20]. Additionally, predicted extreme
    weather events due to climate change will further worsen the situation. Besides
    hostile environmental conditions, increasing water scarcity in these regions is
    posing serious threats to irrigated agriculture and sustained food production
    [16]. Although agriculture consumes about 80% of the total water utilized in the
    agriculture sector globally [14], this irrigation generates a lower return per
    unit of water used than other economic sectors [21]. The use of traditional irrigation
    methods and low water use efficiency (35–40%) caused by poor management are major
    constraints to sustainable crop production in drylands [22,23]. Moreover, farmers
    in these regions still rely on traditional irrigation systems that manifest the
    lowest WUE. This situation puts enormous pressure on the agriculture sector to
    become more efficient in irrigation water use and evoked the call for a “Blue
    Revolution” in water-limited agricultural regions “to produce more crop per drop
    of water.” Efficient water-saving irrigation approaches, especially the application
    of smart irrigation systems, have the potential to meet this critical challenge
    in dryland productivity. A smart irrigation system applies water in the right
    amount, at the right time and place, in a field [24]. Smart irrigation offers
    better irrigation decision-making by using several factors, including soil and
    climate variation, soil hydraulic properties, plant responses to water deficits,
    and changes in weather factors, that can help save water and increase yields [25].
    By using smart irrigation systems, farmers can save precious resources without
    exposing plants to moisture deficiencies [26]. Smart irrigation has been argued
    as a way to manage soil variability and gain economic benefits by fulfilling the
    specific irrigation demands of individual crops [27]. It is also implied that
    the smart irrigation system will be managed in such a way that will enable nutrients
    and water to be delivered directly to the plant roots [28]. To the best of our
    knowledge, studies addressing the issue of low water productivity in dryland agriculture
    and its improvement through adoption of smart irrigation approaches is limited.
    Therefore, the specific objectives of this article were (i) to present an overview
    of the constraints of low water use efficiency in dryland agriculture, (ii) to
    assess the conventional irrigation scheduling methods, and (iii) to examine the
    feasibility and benefits of smart irrigation systems for better irrigation management
    to enhance water productivity in water-scarce regions. 2. Major Constraints of
    Agricultural Productivity in Drylands 2.1. Land Degradation Natural processes
    such as vegetation loss, wildfires, overgrazing, climate change, wind and water
    erosion and other adverse/destructive anthropogenic activities cause land degradation
    (Figure 1) [3,29]. This causes a substantial decline in the functional capabilities
    of those specific areas, negatively influences agricultural activities and productivity
    and natural resources management, creates economic loss, and loss in biological
    activity [30]. Generally, land degradation is more critical or serious in dryland,
    semiarid and arid areas [31]. These include some parts of central Asia, China,
    Africa and the Mediterranean basin [32]. Land degradation in Africa highly impacts
    Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia (horn of Africa) [33]. A prominent sign of land
    degradation is the occurrence of unexpected climatic conditions and vegetative
    stress [34]. Moreover, low levels of soil nitrogen and organic carbon (C) show
    a state of land degradation that leads to very low soil fertility [35]. Stavi
    and Lal [36] reported that land degradation increases by 5–10 million hectares
    every year globally. Ibrahim et al. [37] found that the increase in land degradation
    observed in the Africa Saharan region was mainly due to the increase in drought
    frequency from 1968–1990. Figure 1. Global distribution of land degradation based
    on severity of human-induced pressure [29]. To gain insight into land degradation
    intensity, statistical methods and models have been utilized using data collected
    over the years. These models allow precise predictions about land degradation
    intensity [38]. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the methods
    used to measure the vegetation mass over a specific area [39]. NDVI represents
    the vegetation state of an area in terms of numerical values. If numerical values
    are negative, it means there is a reduction in vegetation. A study carried out
    by Ibrahim et al. [37] using residual trend analysis of NDVI showed substantial
    evidence of soil degradation in sub-Saharan West Africa. The study also highlighted
    the drought occurrence caused by vegetation decline in Africa. Pravalie et al.
    [40] reported that the impending increase in land degradation is posing serious
    threats to the people of developing countries. Disease proliferation, decrease
    in crop yields and increasing armed conflicts are the major outcomes of land deterioration.
    A possible solution to land degradation is to achieve a state of land degradation
    neutrality (LDN) [41]. LDN is a state where land is retained in a stable condition
    capable of enduring biological functions including facilitating appropriate food
    security [42]. Sustainable land management practices such as soil amendments (addition
    of biochar, manuring, composting) to restore degraded lands could be used to decrease
    the effects of land degradation [43]. 2.2. Water Scarcity Issues and Sustainable
    Development Goals Water availability is one of the main indicators of land degradation,
    and upsurge in land degradation is potentially aggravating water scarcity [44,45].
    Availability of water is jeopardized by lessening of ground and surface water
    due to reduction in biomass [46]. This results in less water available for agricultural
    (Figure 2) [16] and domestic use. Scarcity of water is an indicator of safe water;
    hence, water scarcity is a deficiency in fresh water resources to meet the standard
    water demand [11]. Successful achievement of SDGs is dependent upon the water
    security of both human and environmental systems (Figure 3) because water is directly
    linked to all SDGs [7]. The leading reasons for water scarcity are droughts, climate
    change, and inaccessibility and inadequate management of resources [47]. Rosa
    et al. [16] reported that in 2012, almost 2.3 billion people did not have access
    to safe water. Access to safe water is an important factor as it decreases disease
    frequency and social problems, including unemployment, malnutrition, and poverty
    [48]. Agriculture and industrial sectors use the largest proportion of water,
    and this water is usually drawn from below ground, lakes and rivers [49]. Falkenmark
    [50] reported that water scarcity poses substantial threats to the agriculture
    sector, which requires sufficient quantity of water for irrigation. Crop production
    and food security are directly dependent on sufficient water availability [51].
    Water scarcity leads to plant stress, resulting in various environmental problems,
    such as intensified soil erosion and salt concentration [52]. Increasing climate
    change, land degradation, and population necessitate the development of effective
    management systems to wisely mitigate water scarcity [53,54,55]. Figure 2. The
    global distribution of agricultural blue water scarcity (BWS), green water scarcity
    (GWS), and economic water scarcity (EWS) [16]. Figure 3. Interlinkage of SDGs
    and water highlighting the importance of water security for humans and environment.
    Liu et al. [12] described the common indicators employed to evaluate water scarcity,
    such as IWMI, (a system that evaluates the economic and physical changes influencing
    the availability of water within a country), the criticality ratio (a ratio of
    water consumption to the available water resources) and Falkenmark indicator (which
    compares the quantity of available water against the number of people who consume
    that water). Water stress and crowding indices may also be employed to measure
    water scarcity in a country. These indices also estimate the decrease or increase
    in water scarcity. Efforts are required to curtail the water scarcity issues.
    In this regard, implementing efficient water use practices and managing water
    in high-risk regions are important aspects to address [45]. These efforts could
    decrease water scarcity and increase access to adequate agricultural and drinking
    water. Moreover, by taking care of structural and social customs, governments
    can effectively resolve major conflicts. Hence, joint efforts are needed from
    governments and research institutes to resolve the water scarcity problem successfully
    [56]. 2.3. Climate Variability Variations/changes in climatic conditions often
    impact human, biological and agricultural systems through decreasing water resources,
    rising global temperatures, heavy precipitation, elevation in permafrost thawing,
    worsening water and air quality, rise in sea level, health risk, food supply and
    availability, intense drought, disturbing rainfall periods, and devastating effects
    on coastal infrastructure [57,58]. East Africa is an example of climatic anomalies,
    and the progression of increased rainy seasons, droughts and temperatures is detrimental
    to the development of this area [59]. In Tanzania, crop data techniques predicted
    a yield reduction of 7.6%, 8.8%, and 13% in rice, sorghum and maize by 2050, respectively
    [3]. The impacts of variation in climatic events are significantly negative [60],
    for example, the Mediterranean Basin has shown a prominent rise in average temperatures
    beyond global changes, with significant impacts on plant processes and water resources
    [61]. Climatic variation may induce a significant reduction in crop growth and
    productivity and increase vector-borne diseases, thus threatening food security
    [62]. Heavy rain and early frost may have negative effects on flowering periods
    and induce frost damage, while dry seasons or droughts largely decrease the decomposition
    of soil organic matter [63]. Such alterations induce negative impacts on biological
    systems. Fitness of the population is one of the main factors negatively affecting
    community structures and population dynamics [64]. Thus, it becomes vital to develop
    mitigation practices to decrease climate change impacts on agriculture. Several
    mitigation protocols for climate change impacts suggested by Haussmann et al.
    [65] and Gomez-Zavaglia et al. [66] are: (i) developing skills for water management,
    (ii) improving methods of breeding selection, (iii) capacity building of farmers,
    (iv) genetically improved seeds with better adaptation to increased temperatures,
    (v) reducing livestock and crop emissions, (vi) changes in net irrigation, and
    (vii) sequestering carbon in soils. 2.4. Overexploitation of Groundwater Increasing
    economic growth has resulted in continuous demand for water, leading to groundwater
    overexploitation, especially in big cities [67]. Both humans and the environment
    rely heavily upon groundwater; therefore, understanding its environmental implications
    is vital [68]. Over-pumping of water is a global issue, primarily caused via agricultural
    water use. Among its effects are the drying of wetlands and streams, phreatophytic
    vegetation elimination, soil subsidence, storage loss, decline in groundwater
    level, increased pumping cost, and soil salinization [69,70]. Recently, the exploitation
    of groundwater resources has become increasingly critical, especially in semiarid
    and arid coastal areas. In these regions, the coastal aquifers are at risk due
    to the intrusion of salty marine water. For example, Tripoli in northwestern Libya
    has been experiencing progressive seawater intrusion into its coastal aquifers
    since the 1930s due to its ever-growing demand for water [71]. Groundwater overexploitation
    not only causes water-quality degradation and aquifer depletion but also influences
    the ecological stability of wetlands and streams, resulting in substantial losses
    of biodiversity and habitat. Therefore, societies should realize that water resources
    are vulnerable and finite and discover methods to resolve the stresses of human
    development on nature’s tolerance. Educating the public about human influences
    on the environment is the first step toward sustainable water use. 2.5. Socioeconomic
    Drivers The adverse impacts on water availability, agricultural productivity,
    and economic feasibility have been correlated with the displacement of residents
    [49]. Countries dependent on other countries’ agricultural productive capabilities
    are also seriously affected. Food insecurity and hunger are common outcomes of
    poor agricultural production phases for millions who are dependent on agriculture
    [72]. The 1980s famine in Africa resulted from a decline in agricultural productivity
    [73,74]. Generally, droughts indicate decreased food security [75]. Between 1992
    and 1995, drought periods aggravated already problematic conditions in Africa.
    There was income loss for farmers, a rise in unemployment, and a decline in maize
    export to neighboring states. Moreover, there was an emergence in incurred service
    debts through farmers [76]. Gebremskel et al. [33] stated that drought periods
    in East Africa have caused more than 0.5 million deaths and financial losses up
    to US $1,500,000. Several rural residents heavily rely on land productivity. Thus,
    rising water scarcity, land degradation and drought frequency cause adverse effects
    on people’s lives [77]. Couttenier et al. [78] reported that social conflict could
    erupt as a result of decreased availability of farmland and water (e.g., civil
    war in Darfur). Rifts for agricultural resources and farmland often generate deadly
    circumstances. Ongoing conflicts among Fulani herdsmen farmers in Nigeria are
    another example of such conflicts. These conflicts resulted in 68% of total deaths
    in north-central Nigeria [79]. 2.6. Droughts Drought is a condition of abnormally
    dry weather sufficiently prolonged, lacking water to induce hydrologic imbalance
    and constraining agricultural activities in the affected region [80]. Drought
    types such as inter-annual droughts stay longer and decrease crop productivity,
    whereas inter-seasonal drought may be short and controlled via efficient water
    management [81]. Hermans and McLeman [82] reported that repeated occurrence of
    drought contributed towards degradation of land. Henchiri [83] reported that sub-Saharan
    Africa has faced long periods of drought with greater intensity. Nijbroek et al.
    [84] demonstrated that Namibia is an arid country and faced drought for many years,
    as well as neighboring counties of South Africa being liable to droughts repeatedly
    triggered by El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a system of warm seawater that
    passes over the Pacific about every 10 years. Climate change could trigger desertification,
    induce natural calamities and environmental susceptibility. An increase in drought
    frequency is also expected because of climate change [85]. Droughts cause extreme
    distress to food security, agricultural productivity, and the economy [81]. Losses
    of up to US $120,000,000,000 were noted over a period of 30 years in Europe. In
    southern Africa, more than 10,000,000 tons of food was needed in terms of aid
    to drought-affected areas [3]. Africa has an unpleasant history of droughts with
    devastating effects on food security [86]. The most disturbing drought was during
    1991–1992. It caused a huge loss in agricultural productivity, massive unemployment,
    and economic despair. Given the detrimental effects of drought, it is important
    to improve agricultural practices in response to droughts. One such practice is
    environmental restoration. Land restoration helps to reduce land degradation impacts
    [87]. Rigorous land restoration can be attained through tree plantations in degraded
    lands. Alternatively, in situ planting of seeds that could lead to natural regeneration
    may also be used [87]. Predicting droughts is also useful for proper mitigation.
    Recently, scientists in Kenya introduced a technology by satellite analysis, which
    can forecast droughts with 90% accuracy [88]. Moreover, better water management
    techniques and planting drought-resistant trees and crops may remove the distressing
    damage droughts have on the agriculture. Thus, most African nations should focus
    on irrigation as a method to reduce drought impacts (Figure 4) [89]. Figure 4.
    Countries affected by drought in 2020–2022 [89]. 2.7. Conventional Technology
    In dryland regions, most farmers employ old farming techniques that result in
    failure to manage food for increasing populations [90]. The traditional farming
    techniques generate little food [3]. Agriculture conservation (crop rotation,
    soil cover and minimum tillage) could help to enhance crop yields with increasing
    profitability and decreasing soil degradation [91]. Some techniques are not used
    by subsistence farmers mainly because of unfamiliarity [92]. The implication of
    microbial-resistant varieties or seeds is less common in Africa [93]. These advancements
    have the capability to improve yield and increase stress tolerance. Nonetheless,
    most farmers in rural areas are lacking access to services and information to
    be effectively used in their favor [94]. Sarkar et al. [95] reported that the
    use of modern techniques is helpful and provides opportunities to farmers for
    increasing the crop yields. Digitizing farming methods permits farmers to guess
    the yield and weather forecast, select suitable crops according to the area, and
    improve irrigation systems. Nuclear technology is also used as a tool to increase
    yield via radioactive isotope utilization. These are used as early detectors and
    tracers of the existence of diseases. Moreover, applying nuclear technology in
    agricultural practices can increase crop productivity by 40%, improve soil structure
    and texture, and decrease labor and input costs [96]. Nonetheless, the main hindrance
    is that modern farming techniques and technologies are not available to the majority
    of farmers in dryland areas. 3. Traditional Approaches Used for Irrigation Scheduling
    The amount of water and its application timing is crucial in irrigation scheduling
    (IS), either in agriculture or landscapes [97,98]. Irrigation water requirement
    is measured following a criterion that determines irrigation needs and methods
    to apply a calculated amount of water [18]. In order to use irrigation water efficiently,
    we have to understand the dynamics of plant water use, together with weather,
    plant physiology, and soil properties. Among the various irrigation scheduling
    approaches developed and suggested, three types are most important: weather-based,
    soil moisture-based, and plant water status-based [28,99]. 3.1. Weather-Based
    Irrigation Scheduling In weather-based irrigation planning, reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) is calculated by measuring the weather elements that reflect the amount
    of water lost via plants and soil [28]. Solar radiation, humidity, air temperature
    and wind speed influence the quantity of water lost through evapotranspiration.
    In the absence of soil and plant measurements, weather attributes are used to
    determine irrigation schedules based on evapotranspiration [100]. Reference evapotranspiration
    can be calculated following the FAO Penman–Monteith equation by measuring the
    solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and humidity [100,101]. Daily crop
    water use can be calculated by: ETc = Kc × ET0 where ETc = crop evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1), Kc = crop coefficient, and ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm
    day−1). The method is strongly dependent on (1) the accurate calculation of ET0,
    (2) better Kc curve development over the entire crop-growing season, (3) determination
    of soil water-holding capacity by analyzing soil properties, and (4) quantifying
    site-specific rainfall [102]. Mostly, real-time weather monitoring systems are
    equipped with an automatic weather station containing sensors for temperature,
    rainfall, wind speed, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation [103].
    These data loggers are designed to obtain data automatically at periodic intervals,
    and these data are transferred to an online data access portal. Data loggers communicate
    with remote servers using a wireless sensor network (WSN) or Internet of Things
    (IoT) framework [18]. WSN is one of the most popular technological methods that
    is used to precisely monitor the weather and environmental parameters [104,105,106,107,108].
    These data finally reach smart irrigation controllers, which in combination with
    site-specific variables (e.g., soil type), set up the irrigation schedule. The
    selection and performance of a weather monitoring system depends upon different
    accuracy, installation, robustness, data acquisition, maintenance, and power requirements.
    An IoT-based weather monitoring system demonstrated by Wasson et al. [109] monitors
    and analyzes the crop environment in terms of wind speed, temperature, solar radiation,
    soil moisture, and humidity using various weather-based sensors connected through
    a wireless network for data transfer and web-based services. Likewise, Khoa et
    al. [110] implemented an IoT platform for smart irrigation management. They suggested
    an innovative topology of sensor nodes with low cost. The authors were satisfied
    with the performance of the LoRa LPWAN (long-range low-power wide area network)
    technology transmission module system. A multiagent-based monitoring approach
    consisting of an open-source platform (PANGEA) was used to collect data on weather
    elements and soil moisture via different sensors. This platform is equipped with
    several master and slave nodes connected through sensors for data transfer [111].
    Many researchers [112,113,114] have also employed WSN and IoT based platforms
    for weather-based monitoring and reported satisfactory performance of the systems.
    Although weather-based irrigation scheduling is widely practiced, the heterogeneity
    of soil properties used to estimate soil water volume affects the amount of available
    soil water. In addition to that, spatiotemporal, variability in large-scale evapotranspiration
    is another challenge confronted by this approach. 3.2. Plant-Based Irrigation
    Scheduling Plant-based irrigation scheduling mainly relies on several indices
    indicating plant water status [115]. The relationship between soil moisture deficit
    and crop water stress helps to determine irrigation scheduling. Plant-based irrigation
    scheduling is sensitive to measurements conducted at a specific crop stage to
    determine water deficit in plants [18]. Since varying plant species, plant tissues,
    and crop growth stages have variable sensitivity to moisture deficit, several
    plant-based stress measurements have been suggested for irrigation scheduling
    [99]. There are two principal categories based on plant variable measurements
    used for irrigation scheduling: firstly, plant water status-based direct measurements
    including leaf, stem, and xylem water potential status and indirect measurements
    pertinent to leaf thickness, turgor pressure, and trunk diameter [116,117]; and
    secondly, plant physiology-based estimates including sap flow, stomatal conductance,
    xylem cavitation, and thermal sensing [118]. A leaf turgor pressure sensor estimates
    the relative change in leaf turgor pressure to determine leaf water stress [119].
    In addition to transpiration water loss, root water uptake and cellular osmotic
    pressure determine the magnitude of turgor pressure. For example, a ZIM probe
    (leaf turgor pressure sensor) is a noninvasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe
    that can detect leaf turgor pressure. ZIM probes are capable of measuring even
    minute shifts of turgor pressure within leaves in real time [119,120]. Due to
    advanced electronic technologies, researchers have developed small leaf sensors
    and tested them against cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) plants. Leaf thickness-based irrigation timing improved WUE by 25–45% compared
    to preset irrigation plans [121]. In another study, Afzal et al. [122] reported
    that leaf thickness and leaf electrical capacitance (CAP) could be employed for
    leaf water status monitoring. Based on energy balance and heat pulse, thermal
    sensors have been developed to determine sap flow from plant stems, assisting
    irrigation scheduling. Sap-flow methods are able to provide in situ measurements
    of plant water use and transpiration dynamics. The Dynagage sap-flow sensors are
    the latest ones used to estimate sap flow and thus the water consumption by plant.
    The amount of heat utilized by the sap is measured by the energy balance sensors
    and gives the real-time sap flow in grams or kilograms per hour. These sensors
    require no calibration and offer an efficient and affordable method to determine
    the water use of plants [28]. During transpiration, the water in the xylem subjected
    to tension is directly proportional to the deficit in water to the point where
    the water columns can rupture or cavitate [123]. This cavitation leads to the
    eruptive formation of a bubble that contains water vapor [124]. Audio or ultrasonic
    frequency signals can detect these cavitation events, and the associated embolisms
    can hinder water flow [116]. Detection of such ultrasonic acoustic emissions (AEs)
    indicates plant stress and cavitation events. Thus, the AE rate can be used as
    a sensor to detect plant stress. Stem Diameter Fluctuations Stem and fruit diameter
    experience diurnal fluctuations due to changing water content [125]. Various water
    stress indicators can be determined by analyzing the daily patterns of stem diameter
    variation (SDV) [126]. The maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and stem growth rate
    (SGR) are commonly used indicators for scheduling irrigation [115]. Currently,
    different optical sensors are used to detect plant water status, nutrient level
    and health condition. Two types of optical sensors (contact and noncontact) are
    primarily used [18]. Contact sensors are physically connected to plants, whereas
    noncontact sensors are vehicle-mounted, fixed, handled, or remotely controlled
    (aerial vehicles or satellite data) [28]. In many studies, monitoring through
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high-resolution cameras helped to generate
    irrigation maps over large cropped areas [127,128]. In another study, Lozoya et
    al. [129] used a sensor network to control green pepper growth under four different
    irrigation designs. Bauer and Aschenbruck [130] employed IoT and sensor network
    integration to monitor leaf area for optimizing irrigation. Several factors other
    than water content can affect the SDV-derived index, such as plant age, crop load,
    and field management practices. Furthermore, SDV estimates are usually affected
    by small raindrops and animals [131]. Canopy temperature measurement is another
    key method commonly employed for irrigation scheduling. Major canopy temperature-based
    methods include the crop water stress index (CWSI), temperature–time threshold
    (TTT), and temperature stress day (TSD) [132,133,134]. Infrared thermometers and
    thermal cameras are used to detect temperature. However, diurnal dynamics of temperature
    remain a major challenge for all the canopy temperature-based methods [99]. A
    major drawback of using plant-based sensors for irrigation management is that
    they lack direct estimates of irrigation water amount to be applied. Soil textural
    variability is another challenge affecting the accurate estimation of irrigation
    amounts needed. 3.3. Irrigation Scheduling Based on Soil Moisture Soil moisture
    monitoring is one of the fundamental approaches used for irrigation scheduling,
    and it is conducted by determining the soil water content or the soil water potential
    [135]. Monitoring soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution is critical
    for optimal irrigation scheduling [28]. Different types of sensors, such as time-domain
    transmission, neutron probes, granular matrix, and capacitance, are commonly implemented
    for soil moisture determination [136]. Gravimetric sampling to estimate soil moisture
    fluxes and a tensiometer is also used to measure soil matric potential, reflecting
    the amount of soil water available for plant use [99]. With the advancement of
    technology, satellite and groundwater sensors are becoming popular as irrigation
    tools. Soil moisture sensors can be installed at multiple depths in the field
    and capture soil moisture dynamics. They enhance accuracy and improve understanding
    of changes appearing in soil water content pertinent to crop water use and irrigation
    [137]. Soil sensors also provide information about soil chemical, physical and
    mechanical properties obtained in the form of optical, electrical, mechanical,
    electromagnetic, acoustic, radiometric, and pneumatic measurements [138]. Measurement
    of these attributes assists in the estimation of maximum allowable depletion [139].
    Soil moisture sensors estimate the volumetric moisture content (VMC) by detecting
    changes in soil electrical and thermal properties [140]. Frequency-domain reflectometry
    sensors (FDR) can estimate field soil moisture content [129]. The sensors are
    put near the crop roots and show a moisture content range of 0–50% with 0.1% resolution,
    thus optimizing water use for vegetables. Shigeta et al. [141] found that real-time
    soil moisture sensing can be used in practical measurements of soil moisture fluxes
    by correlating the VWC of the soil with the capacitance of sensors inserted in
    the soil. In TDR sensors, two parallel rods are inserted at the desired depth
    to measure the soil moisture content. The rate of the electromagnetic pulse, which
    radiates from the sensor into the soil and returns to the soil surface, is directly
    proportional to soil water content. However, this is an expensive method for farmers.
    Other studies [142,143,144] interconnected IoT-based field monitoring with cloud-based
    monitoring and data analysis using an Ardunio controller. They found that the
    collected data were used to make predictions that helped reduce water consumption
    and improve crop yields. In another study, six capacitance-based sensors were
    used at three locations with a data logger [145]. This method improved the WUE
    compared to traditional approaches. Soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling
    has the disadvantage that plant water uptake and stress are affected by soil moisture
    content and also influenced by environmental conditions, pests and diseases, root
    zone salinity, and nutrient availability. Variation in soil properties also affects
    irrigation scheduling, which necessitates soil testing at multiple points for
    accurate estimation of soil moisture content. 4. Innovative Smart Irrigation Approaches
    A smart irrigation system consists of firmware, software, and hardware interconnected
    via various computational techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI) and
    deep learning (DL) etc., which ensures the right amount of water at the appropriate
    time in crops to improve WUE, increase yield, reduce fertilizer use, reduce labor
    cost, and save energy [146]. Various control methods are employed to improve irrigation
    system efficiency by monitoring variables such as canopy and air temperature,
    evapotranspiration, rainfall, and solar radiation. By integrating information
    from multiple sources, smart irrigation systems can significantly improve crop
    production and resource management [147]. The following section presents various
    recent techniques associated with smart irrigation systems in agriculture. 4.1.
    State-of-the-Art Smart Irrigation Technologies 4.1.1. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Deep Learning AI is a machine’s ability to learn and implement tasks
    similar to those of a human brain, and it is powered by computers [148]. When
    applied to a certain problem domain, AI algorithms can mimic human decision-making.
    Irrigation systems have been integrated with AI for adaptive decision-making through
    fuzzy logic, expert systems, and ANNs [149]. An artificial neural network (ANN)
    is an algorithm for processing information that is inspired by the working of
    the human brain [150]. Like human brain neurons, an ANN also contains a neural
    network, but synapses are substituted with biased connections and weights [151].
    This facilitates the mapping of input and output relationships [152]. ANN-based
    control systems can learn and adapt to the variable dynamics, making them ideal
    for irrigation systems. Additionally, ANNs have been used as smart strategies
    in dealing with the issue of formulating mathematical models based on first principles.
    Recently, many researchers have employed ANN methods for irrigation scheduling.
    Using the AQUACROP model integrated with a dynamic neural network, Adeyemi et
    al. (2018) [149] simulated soil moisture for a potato crop. Karasekreter et al.
    [153] demonstrated energy and water savings up to 23.9% and 20.5%, respectively,
    by implementing an ANN integrated with soil physical properties and moisture content
    in a strawberry orchard. Umair and Muhammad [154] designed an ANN-based controller
    model in MATLAB using climate variables as input. A fuzzy logic system is an extension
    of Boolean logic that expresses logical values in the form of true or false and
    demonstrates the nonlinearity and uncertainty in real-world problems [155]. The
    fuzzy system uses different sets of input data to categorize data in membership
    classes, and then applies a decision rule to every set to produce human-like decision
    outputs [103]. Many researchers have recommended the use of fuzzy logic in irrigation
    control systems. Mendes et al. [156] designed a fuzzy inference system that can
    control the speed of the central pivot according to the spatial field variability.
    A fuzzy irrigation system developed by Mousa et al. [157] was used to compute
    evapotranspiration (ETo) via a fuzzy inference system using weather variables
    as input. They found that the fuzzy model was accurate and quick in obtaining
    the required evapotranspiration and net irrigation to recover the water loss.
    An expert system is another type of intelligent system used for irrigation control.
    Basically, an expert system is a computer program that simulates the verdict and
    behavior of an individual or organization with expertise in a certain area through
    the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies [158]. Expert systems can
    be used for problem-solving activities such as monitoring, control, planning,
    forecasting, prescribing, fusion, and decision-making [159]. An expert-controlled
    irrigation system enables farmers to quantify the water amount needed by crops
    at the appropriate time by considering the weather and soil conditions. Many researchers
    [160,161] have implemented expert systems for irrigation management. The expert
    system uses various knowledge-based inputs for accurate decision-making about
    irrigation scheduling. However, errors in knowledge-based input can seriously
    affect the performance and reliability of expert systems [162]. A hybrid intelligence
    system is another type of intelligent control system in which at least two artificial
    intelligence algorithms such as fuzzy logic and neural network are combined, known
    as “neuro-fuzzy” [149]. Other examples of such hybrid intelligence systems include
    fuzzy PID and GAPSO. Tsang et al. [152] employed seven different machine-learning
    algorithms to assess soil moisture conditions using aerial images of agricultural
    fields to control irrigation. The results demonstrated a 52% reduction in water
    consumption by reducing timing, irrigation level, and location errors. Similarly,
    a combination of ANN, genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bayesian framework was implemented
    to forecast daily irrigation demand under limited data conditions [163]. The results
    exhibited an improvement in forecast precision by 3% and 11%. Many other studies
    also demonstrated the use of intelligent hybrid systems and reported precise forecasting
    and improved control of irrigation systems [164,165]. The deep learning method
    is now applied to deal with millions of weights among neurons for a better understanding
    of behaviors owing to recent developments in computing technology in parallel
    processing, software and hardware. Deep learning has developed a revolutionary
    epoch, since it can solve the problems confronted by artificial intelligence for
    a long period [166]. Deep learning has been applied in the agriculture and hydrology
    fields due to difficulty in software data availability, budget, and complexity,
    such as crop evapotranspiration modeling and approximation [167]. Wang and Ma
    [168] reported that the traditional machine learning and deep learning models
    work similarly as a data-driven artificial intelligence technique and could be
    applied to model the convoluted correlation between input and output (Table 1).
    Nonetheless, deep learning has an advantage over traditional machine learning
    techniques because of its great hierarchical structure model [169]. Table 1. Application
    of various artificial intelligence technologies for irrigation management. 4.1.2.
    Model Predictive Irrigation Systems Development in smart agriculture through internet
    usage and increasing computational power facilitated large data collection from
    agricultural systems [180]. The model predictive system has been employed in irrigation
    scheduling, irrigation canal control, soil moisture, and stem water potential
    regulation [55]. Model predictive control (MPC) has manifested applicability to
    gate operation and control the canal flow. The management goal of model predictive
    control for canals is to maintain the level of water as close to the set-points
    as possible [181]. Thus, an appropriate model regulating the dynamics of canal-water
    levels is required. A model predictive control system has been employed to model
    water movement in the canals, keeping a specific level of water at different locations
    and the flow of water that affects these water levels [182,183,184]. The controlling
    instruments maintain the flow of water, by which the regulator can attain the
    management goals [180]. Nonetheless, attaining this goal is not straightforward,
    as variations in inflows and outflows interrupt the whole water system. To estimate
    future water flows and levels in response to control actions and disturbances,
    the water system (controller, canal reaches, disturbances and structures) needs
    to be modeled. Several authors have applied MPC in driving irrigation flows of
    canals. For instance, Puig et al. [185] applied MPC to create flow control approaches
    from the source of water to the user and Guadiana River’s irrigation territory.
    The results exhibited the usefulness of the MPC application. Zhang et al. [186]
    developed a non-cooperative distributed MPC algorithm based on Nash optimality
    for the regulation of water levels in canals. The simulation of system results
    indicated the efficacy of the advocated algorithm. To efficiently deliver the
    flow of a canal without oscillations, MPC was combined with online water storage
    to allow for a delay and evade wave distraction. The results indicated the significant
    development of canal setups using automation [180]. 4.1.3. Variable-Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) VRI is a method of applying irrigation at variable rates in different irrigation
    management zones over the entire field in an optimized way [187]. Normally, the
    application of irrigation water is uniform in the entire field. However, owing
    to soil spatial variability in soil topography, hydraulic properties and vegetation
    condition, the soil moisture content remains nonuniform [188]. When such soil
    spatial variability becomes significant, the field is split into different management
    zones consisting of those field areas with the same soil properties and crop conditions
    [150]. Then, irrigation is applied at differential rates in different management
    zones [189]. Such variable irrigation management may enhance the economic value
    of irrigation by improving WUE, increasing productivity and reduction in nutrient
    leaching [190]. This enables an accurate and timely water application based on
    soil spatiotemporal properties and plant demand [191]. In other words, VRI technology
    ensures the application of the right amount of water at the right time in the
    right field zone, resulting in significant water savings. The main components
    of VRI technology include sensors, prescription maps, spatial information, and
    a unit system to apply VRI prescription (lateral irrigation) in the crop field
    [192]. Optimization of VRI prescriptions is usually determined by using remote
    sensing, yield maps, topography, soil apparent electrical conductivity and soil
    maps [193,194]. There are different types of irrigation systems used for VRI applications.
    The variable-rate lateral irrigation system contains a global navigation satellite
    system (GNSS) or global positioning system (GPS) receiver, custom software-operated
    relays, and valves, thus supplying water at variable rates using the nozzle-pulsing
    method with a speed controller [26]. This system has high accuracy in controlling
    the irrigation rate and forward speed [195]. Likewise, the center pivot VRI system
    consists of a VRI and pivot control panels, control nodes, solenoid valves, a
    GNSS, a remote sensing control system, and a variable-frequency drive (VFD) [191].
    The speed and operation of the pivot are regulated by pivot control. The VRI controller
    panel governs the irrigation application based on pivot location and the prescription
    map. The flow of sprinkler heads is controlled by solenoid valves [26]. The pivot
    positioning is regulated by the GNSS system, and the control nodes attached to
    the pivot govern the valve opening and closing. VFD regulates the pressure by
    altering the irrigation rate at different points in the field [196]. The rotation
    speed of the pump impeller is also controlled by the VFD in response to the input
    communicated by the pressure switch mounted on the pump. It helps to maintain
    the pressure within the predefined threshold limits [197]. The use of VRI technology
    offers several advantages over conventional irrigation methods. VRI can substantially
    improve overall yields by avoiding under-irrigation and/or over-irrigation. The
    growers usually set up soil moisture sensors in those field areas with low soil
    water-holding capacity (WHC) to prevent under-irrigation in the field [198]. This
    practice may increase irrigation frequency, leading to over- irrigation with high
    soil WHC. Over-irrigation may result in yield loss due to nutrient leaching and
    depletion of oxygen in the root zone [39]. The prevention of under-irrigation
    in those field areas with higher yield potential could help optimize water input.
    Another advantage of using VRI is that irrigation can be withheld over those field
    areas that are not arable [199]. VRI also supports fertilizer application at variable
    rates that would benefit in matching the variability in crop nutrient requirements
    [200]. A two-year study led by Sui and Yan [192] demonstrated that crop water
    productivity for corn and soybean was much better under VRI than uniform rate
    irrigation (URI) in Mississippi. In another investigation, application of VRI
    with delineated management zones based on the difference in WHC showed better
    crop water productivity for maize and winter wheat, which was higher than the
    overall average of the field [201]. Besides its several advantages, VRI also has
    some disadvantages, including higher cost, complexity in developing soil maps,
    and maintenance of the system [202]. Overall, VRI technology is a good option
    to precisely utilize precious water resources, but considerable efforts are needed
    to make this technology affordable and more user-friendly. 4.1.4. Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for Irrigation Management UAVs, also called drones [203], are
    frequently linked with military operations, as they are used as weapons for targeting
    aircraft and involved in intelligence services. Recently, drones have been used
    in a wide range of applications, including delivery services, weather monitoring,
    traffic monitoring, surveillance, and rescue [204]. Several studies emphasized
    UAV utilization for forecasting and monitoring in agriculture to maintain crop
    health [205]. Drones are also useful for irrigation monitoring, as they use infrared
    or thermal imaging cameras in the IOT network [206]. Manual spraying of pesticides
    induces lethal diseases to workers globally, as described by the World Health
    Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization [207]. Thus, UAVs could be
    a potential alternative to manual pesticide spraying, reducing the potential ecological/environmental
    risks and health problems [205]. Recently, UAVs with IoT-based sensor networks
    have been used for smart irrigation purposes, thus significantly improving crop
    productivity [208]. Chebrolu et al. [209] suggested a technique of UAV images
    to rebuild a three-dimensional crop model that mediates crop growth monitoring
    based on a plant level. Likewise, the plant height of sorghum and maize plants
    was measured based on UAV images and a three-dimensional model [210]. Roth et
    al. [211] reported that the RMSE (root-mean-square error) was 0.33 m for a single
    sorghum’s height. The soybean leaf area index was extracted using 3D and UAV plant
    models. In another study, carried out by Deng et al. [212], different cameras
    were fixed on UAVs for smart farming. The results indicated that the UAV-based
    multiband images are useful and showed substantial ability for precise irrigation
    and agriculture management. RGB (red, green and blue) cameras can be used with
    a drone to determine crop biomass using visible reflectance for assessing vegetation
    indices [213]. According to Rokhmana [214], using UAVs for remote sensing can
    support precision farming. They can be used to obtain periodic information from
    the field, i.e., stock evaluation, plant health and vegetation monitoring. Several
    researchers examined the chances of applying IoT systems to govern crop health
    and irrigation monitoring. Automated water irrigation was innovated and employed
    by mobile applications [215]. The designed smartphone application can process
    and develop the soil images near the root surface of plants to ascertain sensor-less
    water quality. A smart drip irrigation method was established using an ARM9 processor,
    involving environmental conditions including CO2 amount, low moisture, and high
    temperature [216]. Zaier et al. [217] suggested an irrigation system controlled
    wirelessly to promote groundwater usage in large-scale fields of Oman. Oksanen
    et al. [218] stated that big data and IoT could be used to establish a real-time
    crop growth monitoring system, facilitating precise irrigation estimates. Based
    on the collection of plant data, they suggested establishing a central unit to
    develop a crop growth model, Oksanen et al. [218] proposed a method to forecast
    and diagnose wheat diseases, weeds, and pests using a computerized IoT-based method.
    A fungicide and insecticide management system based on predictive models for pests
    and crop diseases has also been developed using the IoT [219]. A new irrigation
    method based on the IoT was proposed by [220] where humidity sensors were applied,
    and high humidity values of 90–95% were recorded (Table 2). Table 2. Application
    of different types of UAVs for irrigation management. 4.2. Forecasting Smart Irrigation
    Technology with DSSIS A decision support system (DSS) is an interactive software-based
    system used to identify, analyze, and improve decisions based on raw data, documents,
    and personal knowledge [99]. Various decision support systems (DSSs) have been
    designed for managing irrigation water to improve WUE [230,231]. A smart and efficient
    DSS has to consider several factors, such as soil water status, crop type, irrigation
    method, weather information, and application, to develop irrigation scheduling
    [19]. To facilitate precise irrigation scheduling by minimizing errors in field
    soil moisture estimates, DSSs provide irrigation schedules not only for the current
    day but also to forecast irrigation events for future days. Based on the idea
    of forecasting irrigation, recently a prototype of an irrigation scheduling DSS
    called decision support system for irrigation scheduling (DSSIS) has been developed
    for arid regions [232]. This DSSIS has the ability to predict irrigation events
    for the current day as well as forecast irrigation for the future by using the
    weather information of the next 4 days. The DSSIS prototype consists of irrigation
    pipelines, software and hardware to control irrigation and peripheral equipment
    The irrigation pipelines consist of a drip irrigation system, valves and polyvinyl
    chloride pipes. The software controlling the irrigation system includes RZWQM2
    (Root Zone Water Quality Model) integrated with an irrigation scheduling software
    (RZ Irrsch and an online weather data acquisition system [233]. The irrigation-controlling
    hardware contains automatic control equipment. A peripheral equipment consists
    of a water reservoir, circulating pumps, and strainers. In DSSIS, the RZWQM2 model
    works as an engine and facilitates decision-making about irrigation scheduling.
    The RZWQM2 is first calibrated and validated according to site-specific experimental
    data (crop, weather, and soil data). The IrrSch software generates daily weather
    data from the nearby weather stations and also forecasts upcoming 4-day weather
    using a weather application program interface (API) then transfer this information
    to RZWQM2 [99]. Based on the information given by IrrSch, RZWQM2 predicts crop
    evapotranspiration, soil water stress factor (SWFAC), and soil moisture content
    for the current and next 4 days. When the current day’s water stress level falls
    below the preset threshold, an irrigation event is initiated. The amount of water
    to be supplied is computed by RZWQM2 using field capacity and the predicted soil
    water content and rooting depth. This system (DSSIS) has been tested for cotton
    irrigation scheduling under full, deficit, experience, and sensor-based irrigation
    treatments in an arid region. Under deficit irrigation, DSSIS saved 50% of irrigation
    water with a 4% increase in yield and up to 80% increase in water productivity
    over experience-based irrigation [232]. In another study, Chen et al. [234] evaluated
    the effect of irrigation scheduling by DSSIS on water productivity, seed cotton
    yield, and economic profitability under an arid desert climate. Under DSSIS, water
    productivity, seed cotton yield, and economic benefit were higher than soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling. Full irrigation DSS also maintained crop yield
    under deficit irrigation treatment. In a three-year field study, Chen et al. [233]
    evaluated irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) in cotton using the RZWQM2 model
    with DSSIS in an arid oasis. After validation, the RZWQM2 model was run with seven
    irrigation scenarios (from 850 to 350 mm water), and the long-term weather data
    (1990–2019) were used to estimate the best IWUE. The results manifested that the
    irrigation with 660 mm water produced the highest seed cotton yield (4.09 Mg ha−1),
    whereas irrigation with 550 mm water exhibited the highest IWUE (6.53 kg ha−1mm−1).
    These findings provided important guidelines for farmers to use deficit irrigation
    strategies. This will also help the farmers to develop and improve irrigation
    scheduling strategies with respect to their specific crop production settings.
    This irrigation forecasting DSSIS has been tested on a small scale in an arid
    oasis and provided satisfactory results regarding water productivity. It could
    be promoted over a large scale. To further improve the site-specific irrigation
    management, the soil textural variability could be analyzed and a local-level
    soil database could be developed through extensive soil sampling and analysis.
    This soil database could be integrated with DSSIS for scheduling irrigation for
    a specific field. This concept of irrigation is termed soil test-based irrigation
    prescription (STIP). Availability of site-specific soil information may result
    in potential gains in improved WUE and higher profitability in arid regions where
    existing irrigation strategies are poorly connected with local agronomic and biophysical
    settings. Hence, development of the STIP concept could be a way forward to improve
    WUE and further strengthen efforts to conserve and efficiently utilize the limited
    water resources in arid and hyperarid regions. 5. Future Prospects This paper
    presented an overview of advanced and smart irrigation practices for improving
    WUE in water-limited regions, but still there are some challenges that are important
    to consider for designing smart, sustainable and user-friendly irrigation systems.
    I. Variability in soil texture is a vital source of uncertainty because it influences
    the current and potential soil water storage estimates both vertically and latterly
    in a field. Therefore, site-specific soil analysis is one way to rectify this
    problem and obtain the exact soil parameter information needed for accurate irrigation
    scheduling. Site-specific soil test-based information integrated with smart irrigation
    systems can help to improve WUE in arid and semiarid regions. This method is called
    soil test-based irrigation prescription (STIP). The proper execution of STIP needs
    specific field soil sampling, analysis of soil properties and development of a
    soil database. This soil information with crop and weather data can be integrated
    with a model or decision support system to forecast an irrigation event. II. Most
    of the experiments related to smart irrigation systems were conducted on a small
    scale in research fields or under controlled environmental conditions, which cannot
    represent commercial farming practices. Therefore, more on-farm studies in large
    fields are needed for a clear understanding about the implementation of smart
    irrigation technology. III. Most of the commercial smart irrigation systems offered
    by different irrigation companies help to improve water use efficiency, but the
    high cost of these state-of-the-art devices is a serious challenge for farmers.
    Moreover, these commercial smart irrigation systems are custom-built, meaning
    difficulty in control and adaptability. Therefore, affordable and user-friendly
    equipment should be manufactured at a local level. IV. Most of the farmers in
    dryland regions are not well educated and should be trained through practical
    demonstration of smart irrigation systems by expert extension workers. Furthermore,
    governments should provide subsidies to farmers for dissemination of such technologies
    on a large scale. 6. Conclusions This article provided an overview of the major
    constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods,
    and efforts and advancements that have been achieved to enhance WUE, conserve
    water, and most importantly guarantee food security through the adoption of different
    smart irrigation approaches in dryland regions. Dryland agriculture is largely
    affected by low WUE because farmers are relying upon traditional irrigation scheduling
    methods, resulting in over- and/or under-irrigation of fields and yield reduction.
    In this situation, adoption of smart irrigation approaches or technologies including
    artificial intelligence and deep learning (ANN, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid
    intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, VRI
    technology, and UAVs could ensure high water use efficiency and productivity in
    water-scarce regions. These technologies consider several factors, including soil
    and climate variation, soil structure and hydraulic properties, plant responses
    to water deficits, and changes in weather factors to apply the right amount of
    water at the right time and place. However, all these methods face some challenges
    regarding accurate execution and performance under field conditions, which could
    be rectified by incorporating indigenous knowledge and through practical demonstrations
    to the farmers. Smart irrigation technologies are revolutionizing global agriculture.
    Such technologies are highly desirable to achieve the SDGs and improve the living
    standards of poor farmers in drylands. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    and plant feedback 1. Introduction Irrigation can be vital to food production
    systems and economies, especially in arid or semi-arid climate regions. Limited
    freshwater resources can fail to match water demand, therefore efficient scheduling
    methods are desirable to maximize crop yields under limited water supply [[1],
    [2], [3], [4]]. Water use efficiency in intensively irrigated areas can be improved
    by using irrigation schedulers which can link physical interactions between air,
    soil, and plant as a continuum [5,3,6]. However, producers often opt for scheduling
    tools in their decisions if they are cheap to use, flexible for variable conditions,
    and most importantly can provide near real-time crop water requirement and/or
    water stress information [7,8,9,10]. For most irrigation scheduling tools such
    as soil water balance models, process based agricultural models, and soil and
    plant sensors [1], they require local soil, crop, and climate data [11]. Even
    though localized and in-field methods especially soil and plant sensors are less
    prone to errors, they still require deployment and maintenance which can be expensive
    [1,12]. Additionally, majority of methods are limited on spatial and temporal
    resolutions [13,14,5]. Hence, producers require user-friendly and well-designed
    Irrigation Decision Support Systems (IDSS) to inform and potentially automate
    their irrigation scheduling decisions in real-time. Use of infrared thermometry
    in IDSS has had increased interest due to being non-destructive and scalable to
    larger fields [[15], [16], [17]]. Infrared thermometry is commonly used to monitor
    water stress with crop water stress index (CWSI) [[2], [5], [18], [19], [20],
    [21]] but has also been extended for estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    [22,23]. However, application of thermometry scheduled-based decision on producer
    fields might be a challenge due to high costs of sensors, need for programming
    and wiring dataloggers, and data quality issues. Moreover, the collection of canopy
    temperature (Tc) is restricted to only a particular time of the day (i.e., mid-day
    hours) [21] and CWSI baselines are not transferable to regions of different climates
    [21]. Based on those reasons, Payero[4] and Irmak [21] suggested the use of multiple
    linear regressions to develop lower or non-stressed baselines of corn and soybeans
    to ease the computation of CWSI in irrigation management regardless of locality.
    However, use of climatic variables and plant growth parameters to model CWSI can
    be more complex if there are non-linear relationships and this might require robust
    models for better predictions [5,18]. Kumar et al. [5] mentioned that it was worthwhile
    to consider algorithms which eliminates developing baselines to normalize Tc to
    micro-climatic conditions or even avoiding Tc measurements at specified mid-day
    hours such that CWSI is promoted in irrigation scheduling [5]. On the other hand,
    methods which are deemed accurate like ETc, or soil moisture-based methods have
    had limited adoption by producers. A contributing factor is that they require
    high quality and locally relevant data. Availability of weather stations, along
    with knowledge or access to a specialist who has knowledge on how to interpret
    data into an irrigation decision is still a major barrier to adoption of ETc based
    irrigation models [24,25,26]. Therefore, soliciting other simple but robust models
    which can automatically forecast/estimate ETc can be valuable in automated irrigation
    scheduling tools. There is opportunity of using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
    for irrigation scheduling; however, the dataset should include relevant factors
    such as weather conditions as well as plant and soil water status for accurate
    decisions [1]. Previous work has focused on employing algorithms to schedule irrigation
    through estimation of available soil moisture in the rooting zone [11,1,27]. In
    the past, AI techniques were extensively employed in predicting reference or crop
    ET [28,29,30,25,31], but recently they have been used in CWSI estimation [2,5]
    for use in automated scheduling tools. For instance, feed-forward back propagation
    neural network/artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to estimate reference
    ET [28,32] and CWSI in Indian mustard crop [5] as well as well-watered Tc to develop
    lower baselines in sugar beets and wine grapes [2]. Furthermore, machine learning
    (ML) models such as random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and K-Nearest
    Neighbors (KNN), among others, have also estimated ETc in crops such as sugar
    beets [25], maize [33], garlic [34], wheat [33], and potatoes [31]; however, none
    has been used as an option for supporting irrigation scheduling except RF and
    SVM [35]. Interestingly, neural network (NN) models such as Long-Short Term Memory
    (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have now been utilized to monitor soil
    moisture content in the rooting zone to support irrigation scheduling [1] using
    datasets generated from calibrated process-based agricultural models such as Root
    Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) [1] and AQUACROP model [[11], [36]]. Therefore,
    calibrated process-based agricultural models can be used to generate those datasets
    for model training [11,1]. A study done by [27] used ANN to predict soil moisture
    changes using daily weather in addition to fuzzy NN which determined irrigation
    time and watering volume. The advantage with AI models is that they can easily
    identify associations between input and response variables without much inputs
    from the modeler as it is with traditional process-based models [37]. Also, ML
    models can be combined through ensembling to improve their prediction performance
    and accuracy [38]. Exploring the use of AI models for predicting crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) will provide more opportunities of using
    such models in designing of Irrigation Decision Support Systems (IDSS). As seen
    already, NN models can schedule irrigation events through estimating soil water
    deficit [11,1], however, to our knowledge no study has considered the use of other
    ML models as well as their ensembles. Also, it is necessary to conduct optimization
    of irrigation scheduling which has received limited attention by developing intelligent
    irrigation models to ensure improved water use efficiency and water savings [27].
    Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance accuracy of
    different AI algorithms as well as their ensembles in predicting ETc and CWSI,
    using a set of different input combinations containing weather, soil moisture,
    and ancillary parameters such as normalized vegetation index (NDVI), reference
    evapotranspiration (ETr), and cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs) collected
    in two maize growing seasons of 2020 and 2021. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    site, experimental design, and data collection Data collection was conducted in
    2020 and 2021 maize (Zea Mays L.) growing seasons at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
    West Central Research, Extension, and Education Center (WCREEC) in North Platte,
    Nebraska, USA (41.1°N, 100.8°W, 861 m above sea level). This region experiences
    a semi-arid climate with 80% of annual precipitation received between late-April
    and mid-October [4]. The predominant soil type at the site is Cozad silt loam
    [39]. Designed experiment was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four
    replications organized in four blocks (A, B, C, and D) belonging to various irrigation
    treatments for a long-term irrigation trend study (unpublished). However, due
    to limited availability of soil moisture and canopy temperature sensors, only
    three treatments were selected for the current study: full irrigation, deficit
    irrigation (60% of full irrigation amount), and rainfed treatments. Each plot
    had dimensions of 9.1 m by 72.2 m and the plots were situated over a subsurface
    drip irrigation system with drip lines spaced at 1.52 m (every other crop row)
    and installed at 0.4 m depth. Each plot had twelve maize rows of hybrid Pioneer
    1197AMT (Corteva, Agiscience, Willington, Delaware, USA) planted on April 29 in
    2020 and May 7 in 2021 at a population of 84,000 seeds ha−1 with a row spacing
    of 0.76 m. Pre-season nitrogen in the form of urea ammonium nitrate (UAN 32-0-0)
    was applied uniformly on April 12 for 2020 and April 23 for 2021 at a rate of
    67 kg ha−1 with a double coulter applicator at a depth of 0.03 m and at 0.19 m
    from the center of the crop row on both sides. Furthermore, in-season N of 126
    kg ha−1 was applied at five-leaf stage close to the crop row and at the soil surface
    using a 360 Y-DROP system (360 Yield Center, Morton, Illinois, USA). Irrigation
    events were scheduled up to twice per week by monitoring changes in soil water
    storage (or depletion) using a neutron moisture meter (NMM) – CPN 503 Elite Hydroprobe
    (InstroTek, Concord, California, USA). Irrigation was triggered once depletion
    exceeded 50% of the maximum allowable depletion (MAD) in the managed root zone
    assumed as 0.9 m. Daily climate data on a 1-min timestep was collected from the
    onsite Nebraska Climate Office weather station under Nebraska Mesonet (https://mesonet.unl.edu/)
    located within 100 m from the study site. Weather variables collected included
    minimum, maximum and mean air temperatures (Tmin, Tmax, and Ta (°C)), relative
    humidity (RH (%)), wind speed (u3 (m s−1)), and shortwave incoming solar radiation
    (Rs (W m−2)). All variables were measured at 2 m, except for wind speed which
    was measured at 3 m and adjusted to 2 m following Allen et al. [40]. Likewise,
    vapor pressure deficit (VPD (kPa)) was computed following Allen et al. [40]. Arable
    Mark 2 sensors (Arable Labs Inc., San Francisco, CA) were used to collect both
    hourly and daily micro-climate data in the installed plots as well as daily Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Soil volumetric water content (m3 m−3) was
    measured continuously using capacitance sensors (TEROS 12 sensors, Meter Group,
    Pullman, WA) and weekly using neutron moisture meters (NMMs) (InstroTek, Concord,
    California, USA). The first three shallow depths of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m were monitored
    using the TEROS 12 capacitance sensors whereas the deeper depths of 1.2, 1.8,
    and 2.1 m were monitored using NMMs – CPN 503 Elite Hydroprobe and CPN 503DR.
    All sensors were calibrated to local conditions before measurements were taken.
    Soil moisture content at deeper depths for days without NMM readings were estimated
    using a daily soil water balance model [40]. TEROS sensor readings were calibrated
    to NMM using a developed calibration equation ( [41]. Furthermore, daily, and
    continuous canopy temperatures (Tc) were measured every 1 min using infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah, USA) then stored on CR1000X dataloggers
    (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA) from three replications of each selected
    treatment. IRT sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer and installed near
    full canopy closure on June 17 for both 2020 and 2021. 2.2. ETc and CWSI calculations
    Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was computed following FAO56 by Allen et al. [40]
    while using a single crop coefficient approach - a product of crop coefficient
    (Kc) and tall crop (i.e., alfalfa) reference evapotranspiration (ETr) (i.e., ETc
    = Kc × ETr). Modified Penman-Monteith equation [42] was employed to compute ETr
    using daily weather parameters as inputs including Tmin and Tmax, RHmin and RHmax,
    u2, and Rs. Daily Kc values were determined by using cumulative growing degree
    days (CGDDs (°C), based on maximum and base Ta of 28- and 10 °C, respectively)
    to interpolate weekly Kc values determined as ratio of weekly ETc calculated using
    a soil water balance model (Eq. (1)) and measured NMM soil moisture content [43,44].
    Since both years were dry, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP) were assumed
    to be equal to zero as well as the capillary rise (U) given the depth to the water
    table exceeding the rooting zone. (1) where ETc (mm) is crop evapotranspiration,
    P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation (mm), and (mm) is change in soil water
    storage measured using NMMs. Crop water stress index (CWSI) was computed following
    Jackson''s theoretical approach [45,46] at mid-day hours starting from 1200 to
    1600 Central Day Time (CDT) (i.e., 4-hr period from solar noon). Upper limit of
    (Tc – Ta) was calculated with Eq. (2a) after assuming potential canopy resistance
    to increase to infinity or without bound (i.e., rcp =  ), and lower limit (Eq.
    (2c)) was calculated after assuming potential canopy resistance to be equal to
    zero (i.e., rcp = 0) [45,46]. Aerodynamic resistance was computed using Eq. (2d).
    All the computed limits were used in Eq. (2e) to compute CWSI. (2a) where (Tc
    – Ta)U (°C) is the upper limit, (kg m−3) is air density, Cp (J kg−1C−1) is heat
    capacity of air, ra (s m−1) is aerodynamic resistance, G (W m−2) is soil heat
    flux assumed to be 10% of Rn [47], and Rn (W m−2) is net radiation computed based
    on Stefan-Boltzmann relationship following Ortega-Farias et al. [48] and Ben-Gal
    et al. [49] as shown in Eq. (2b). (2b) where Rs (W m−2) is the incoming solar
    radiation, α (0.23 (unitless)) is the surface albedo, (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K) is
    Stefan-Boltzmann constant, (s m−1) is hemispherical longwave atmospheric emissivity
    calculated following Colaizzi et al. [50], and (0.98 (unitless)) is canopy surface
    emissivity [43]. (2c) where (Tc – Ta)L (°C) are upper and lower limits, (Pa °C−1)
    is psychrometric constant, rcp (s m−1) is canopy resistance at full canopy transpiration,
    and (Pa °C−1) is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure. (2d) where ra (s m−1)
    is the aerodynamic resistance, z (m) is the reference measurement height, d (m)
    is the displacement height (d = 0.63 h), h (m) is the canopy height, zo (m) is
    the roughness length (zo = 0.13 h), and u2 (m s−1) is the wind speed at height
    z = 2 m. (2e) where (Tc –Ta)a, (Tc – Ta)U (°C) and (Tc – Ta)L (°C) are differential
    temperature between measured canopy temperature (Tc, °C) and air temperature (Ta,
    °C), upper and lower limits, respectively. 2.3. Artificial intelligence algorithms
    Several machine learning (ML) algorithms were evaluated (Fig. 1) to determine
    the best performing model for ETc and CWSI predictions. The models used included
    Neural Networks (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)),
    decision-tree based (Random Forest (RF), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)), Support
    Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multiple Linear regression (MLR),
    and the ensembles of machine learning models. Three ensembles were considered
    which were stacked random forest (Stacked-RF), stacked regression (Stacked-Regr),
    and weighted average of RF, SVM, KNN, CatBoost, and linear regression (Weighted
    Ensemble). Download : Download high-res image (885KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Artificial Intelligence algorithms evaluated for Crop Evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) predictions. 2.3.1. Artificial neural
    network (ANN) Artificial Neural Network is one of the first AI algorithm and Neural
    Network used in different agricultural applications [2,5,25]. As shown in Fig.
    1, it has an input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer. Generally, the data
    manipulation and learning of data patterns occurs in hidden layers as weighted
    connections of neurons [25]. Each hidden layer contains array of artificial neurons
    and each of those neurons are inter-connected to both the previous and next hidden
    layer. 2.3.2. Long short-term memory (LSTM) The LSTM is one of the Recurrent Neural
    Networks (RNN) and it was developed after realizing the shortcoming of ANN, including
    suffering from vanishing gradient. Basically, it has self-feedback of neurons
    in hidden layers (Fig. 1) which provides the network memory to learn from an entire
    sequence from the portions of the overall sequence (i.e., operates as a dynamic
    system) [11]. The Neural Network has three inputs which are the input of the current
    time step (xt), the output from the previous LSTM unit (ht-1), and the “memory”
    of the previous unit (Ct-1). According to Talib et al. [51], the former is the
    most important input and the main model predictors being the sequence of inputs
    from pervious cells or units. Each LSTM cell or unit generates a new output based
    on current input, previous output, and previous memory. Additionally, it can regulate
    the error flow in the network by learning how to open or close specialized gates
    in the network [11]. 2.3.3. Random forest (RF) Random Forest is one of the supervised
    ensembles used for solving regression and classification problems. However, for
    this study, it was used to solve regression problems in predicting ETc and CWSI.
    This model is an ensemble of different trees designed in such a way that the variability
    of the output can be explained by grouping data in homogeneous sets [51]. The
    training samples are selected randomly to create independent decision trees (i.e.,
    Trees 1, 2, 3 in Fig. 1), where each tree makes a prediction (i.e., k1 to k3),
    and then they are averaged to get a final prediction (k) of the regression problem.
    With RF, high dimensional data can be handled as well as strong non-linear problems
    thus avoiding overfitting [25] since it can reduce error bias by using vote selection
    [26]. 2.3.4. Support vector machines (SVM) The SVM is also a supervised method
    and can solve regression prediction problems by identifying complex non-linearity
    of the input variables. It is a representation of different classes in hyperplane
    in a multidimensional space as illustrated in Fig. 1. The goal is to divide the
    datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane. Linear and non-linear
    SVM can be used to separate data by use of hyperplane or kernels, respectively.
    Kernels convert non-separable problems into separable problems by adding more
    dimensions to the data. Kernel functions include polynomial, linear, sigmoid,
    and radial basis function (rbf) which transform low-dimension input space into
    high dimension. 2.3.5. K-Nearest neighbor (KNN) The ML model termed as KNN is
    a supervised and lazy learning algorithm that requires no information on the primary
    features to set the unknown sample to the k nearest samples. Thus, it is non-parametric
    and depends on irrelevant and redundant features [31]. It is a simple method and
    effective when used and categorizes a new coming sample by using one identified
    sample which is neighboring this new coming sample. The model uses Euclidean distance
    metric to perform the aforementioned task [25]. The method is easy to employ and
    also effective to use. 2.3.6. Categorical boosting (CatBoost) Categorical Boosting
    (CatBoost) in Fig. 1 operates by using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)
    and combines multiple categorical features with their combinations in the current
    tree in a very rigorous and greedy way. A greedy way is used when the tree constructs
    a new split where subsequent splits contain all combinations and classification
    features in the current tree of the dataset with all categorical features [52].
    It generates weaker learners in each iteration and each learner is trained due
    to the gradient of the previous learner and this avoids the gradient bias. Eventually
    balanced trees with less chances of overfitting are used as base predictors. More
    information about CatBoost can be found in Zhang et al. [26]. 2.3.7. Ensembling
    of machine learning models Ensembling can be done by either stacking more than
    two models or finding the average or weighted average of the prediction of each
    independent model. Model stacking involves combining the base learners (i.e.,
    first layer-level 0) whose out-of-bag predictions are used as inputs to final
    predicting or meta-model (i.e., second layer-level 1) [37]. Level 0 is the base
    layer with its inputs being the initial training set and Level 1 is trained using
    the output data from level 0 as the input to obtain the final prediction results.
    Stacking produces a strong learner from poor performing models [53]. For this
    study, three models were created by ensembling, including Stacked Regression,
    Stacked Random Forest, and weighted average ensemble. Stacked Regression had base
    models such as RF, SVM, KNN, and CatBoost, whereas the final prediction model
    being the linear regression. Stacked Random Forest used other models as base models
    and meta-model as RF. Lastly, weighted average ensemble averaged all the model
    prediction as final model output assuming all models had equal weights and contribution
    was the same. In simple terms, the output of each model contributes to the final
    prediction and the predictions from multiple models (i.e., model 1-K), where the
    contribution of each model is weighted proportionally to its prediction accuracy
    or skill [37]. Generally, a weighted average involves first assigning a fixed
    weight coefficient to each model. 2.3.8. Multiple linear regression (MLR) The
    MLR is one of the traditional mathematical models as given in Eq. (3) and part
    of the machine learning models. It describes quantitative relationships between
    a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. The linear regression
    predicts a quantitative response based on multiple predictor variables as a function
    of non-linear combination of the model parameters with more than one independent
    variable(s) [54]. (3) where Y is the dependent variable, are coefficients of the
    independent variables (X1 – Xn). 2.4. Model evaluation to identify best models
    Evaluation of the models for predicting ETc and CWSI was done following steps
    as summarized in Fig. 2. The first step involved creating the dataset using variables
    including weather, soil water content and ancillary variables such as NDVI, ETr,
    and CGDDs (Table 1). Next steps included creating both training and testing data
    sets, then lastly ETc and CWSI predictions with different machine learning models
    and their ensembles as illustrated in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image

    Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical
    Boosting decision tree (CatBoost), as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    as the only traditional mathematical model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked
    Regression, Stacked Random Forest (Stacked RF), and Weighted average ensemble.

    the data set as shown in Table 1 were collected during the mid-season stage of
    maize (i.e., July, August, September) for both years (2020, 2021) since it is
    the period where the crop is sensitive to water stress and where much of the irrigation
    scheduling is needed. Model evaluation for ETc prediction used a total of twelve
    variables: six weather variables (Tmin, Tmax, RH, VPD, u2, Rs), total soil water
    at three soil depths, and three ancillary variables including NDVI, CGDDs, and
    ETr. In contrast, with CWSI, there were five weather variables (Ta, RH, VPD, u2,
    Rs), total soil water at three depths, and one ancillary variable (ETr). On the
    other hand, different input combinations were employed with fifteen combinations
    (Table 2) used for predicting ETc as compared to twelve combinations (Table 3)
    for CWSI prediction. Each combination had total soil water at either of the three
    soil depths and ancillary variables (Tables 2, and 3). The combination number
    accompanied the model to identify the new generic model (model + input combination)
    after following Yamaç [25] and Fan et al. [29]. Table 2. Input feature combinations

    of features (i.e., input variables) for predicting ETc and CWSI, both permutation
    importance and feature importance by random forest were used [37] in addition
    to use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to further evaluate the contribution
    of each feature to the predictions. SHAP values detect the best parameters and
    their impact on the final output using the conditional expectation function while
    visualizing individual feature characterizations [55]. Additionally, the exploratory
    analysis about correlation strength between independent input variable and response
    variables (ETc and CWSI) was also conducted using a confusion matrix based on
    Pearson''s correlation coefficient (r). There was a total of 540 points in a combined
    data set (30 days × 3 months × 2 years). Data set was split into training (60%)
    and testing (40%). Because of limited data, each model was evaluated on each set
    using the repeated k-fold cross validation to ensure models do not overfit as
    well as allowing the models to check every single data point from both sets [35].
    Data pre-processing was done by normalizing the values to the same range (0, 1)
    using Eq. (4) for all variables such that they receive equal attention during
    model predictions [38]. (4) where xn and xi is the normalized and raw values of
    inputs variables, respectively, and xmax and xmin are the minimum and maximum
    values of the input variables, respectively. 2.4.2. Building a program with all
    models A program constituting all models was developed using Python in Google
    Colaboratory interface which is a free Jupyter Notebook environment developed
    by Google Company (Google, CA, USA). Among the third-party libraries which were
    used included Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn machine learning library (Sklearn),
    CatBoost library, as well as TensorFlow and Keras libraries for Neural Network
    (NN) models. On the other hand, prior to training the models, ML models including
    RF, SVM, KNN, and CatBoost were improved by fine tuning their hyperparameters
    using the Grid Search with cross validation (i.e., GridSearchCV) with k-fold equal
    to 10-folds. For the case of NN models such as ANN and LSTM, both the layers and
    their neurons were tuned using “trial and error” as well as Grid Search until
    the best model was achieved. 2.4.3. Evaluation of prediction accuracy Assessment
    of prediction accuracy of the models on both training and testing sets were based
    on four common statistical metrics [26]: coefficient of determination (r2, Eq.
    (5a)), root mean square error (RMSE, Eq. (5b)), mean absolute error (MAE, Eq.
    (5c)), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, Eq. (5d)). Furthermore, the ranking
    procedure as used in Zhang et al. [26] was also adopted to determine the overall
    performance of the 150 ETc predictions (i.e., 15 input combinations × 10 models)
    and 120 CWSI predictions (i.e., 12 input combinations × 10 models), where each
    model received a total ranking score as a sum of scores from all statistical metrics
    (i.e., r2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE). The ranking was done by assigning the model with
    the highest r2 or lowest RMSE/MAE/MAPE with ranking score equal to one, in contrast
    to the model with the lowest r2 or highest RMSE/MAE/MAPE was the worst and given
    a ranking score equal to one hundred fifty for ETc and one hundred twenty for
    CWSI. Overall model performance was therefore based on the total ranking on either
    training or testing set, in simple terms, any model with the smallest total ranking
    score was considered the best [56,26]. The average values of independent metrics
    across all models were also analyzed. (5a) (5b) (5c) (5d) where Pi is the model
    prediction value, Oi is the observed or measured value, and n is the number of
    observations. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Input variables The study was conducted
    in two dry seasons of 2020 and 2021. However, there was variability in weather
    conditions across the years as shown in Table 4 with greater Tmax and smaller
    Tmin in 2020 as compared to 2021. Similarly, mean VPD, u2, and Rs in the mid-season
    of maize was higher in 2020 than 2021 showing a difference of 0.51 kPa, 0.31 m
    s−1, and 4.7 W m−2, respectively. Eventually, higher evaporative demand was also
    observed in 2020 maize growing season with maximum ETr of 13.6 mm d−1 and mean
    ETr of 7.9 mm d−1 as compared to 2020 season which had 10.6 mm d−1 and 6.4 mm
    d−1 following the same order. This might explain the lower mean soil water content
    at deeper soil depths of 2.1 m since the maize in 2020 was aggressively taking
    up soil moisture during the mid-season to match the high evaporative demand. However,
    the difference in soil water content between the two seasons was only 9 mm since
    both were drought years with soil moisture content ranging between 170 – 369 mm
    for 2020 and 172 – 378 mm for 2021. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    values were almost the same across the two years since the maize crop in both
    years experienced similar climatic conditions as well as irrigation and nitrogen
    applications. Both years seemed to have had similar weather extremes despite seeing
    small differences in evaporative demands as well as across weather variables and
    soil moisture content. As commonly observed, NDVI correlated well with crop development
    and crop growth dynamics such as canopy cover and leaf area index. Lastly, NDVI
    also correlated well with the seasonal crop coefficients (Kcr) which is known
    to control seasonal ETc partitioning and soil moisture on the soil surface [51].
    Nevertheless, according to Zhang et al. [26], selected weather variables reflect
    the climatic conditions of the environment, whereby RH and u2 explain the effects
    of aerodynamic resistances on evaporative demand (or ETr), whereas Ta and Rs explain
    the effects of aerodynamic and radiative energy transfer in the study area. Table

    respectively for input and response variables. Both daily ETc, values and corresponding
    input variables were computed as the average of the entire day (24 h period) from
    0600 to 2400 h. Whereas daily CWSI values and corresponding input variables were
    computed as the average for only peak hours or solar noon hours between 1200 and
    1600 h., Central Day Time (CDT). 3.2. Correlation between input and response variables
    A correlation matrix between the input and response variables, which are crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI), was developed based
    on Pearson''s correlation and the coefficients (r) indicated the strength of the
    linear relationships (Fig. 3). With ETc as presented in Fig. 3a, the highest correlation
    was observed with ETr (r = 0.7), followed by VPD (both r = 0.6), and finally those
    with r = 0.5 including NDVI, Tmax, Rs, CGDDs, and total soil water at soil depths
    of 0.9 and 2.1 m. All variables had a positive correlation with ETc, except CGDDs
    and RH, therefore, ETc is lower at higher CGDDs towards crop senescence, but higher
    at lower CGDDs earlier in the season when the crop is still green and healthy
    with higher transpiration rates. Likewise, higher RH indicates lower ETc since
    the evaporative demand decreases. It is good to point out that ancillary variables
    gave the highest correlation coefficient (i.e., strongest relationships) and this
    explains why they were added to all combinations (Tables 2, and 3) as also suggested
    by Yamaç [25]. However, the correlation between CWSI and input variables (Fig.
    3b) generally gave poor correlations (r < 0.3) as compared to ETc where only total
    soil water at 0.9 and 2.1 m profiles (r = 0.6), Ta (r = 0.5), and ETr (r = 0.3)
    showed relatively strong correlations. A negative correlation with total soil
    water at both depths explains that water stress usually reduces under increased
    water sufficiency in the soil profile. Generally, the input variables which were
    positively correlated to response variables explained that their increase in magnitudes
    affected the response variable by reducing it, and vice versa for the input variables
    which were positively correlated to the response variables (i.e., ETc, CWSI).

    and mean air temperatures, respectively, RH is relative humidity, VPD is vapor
    pressure deficit, u2 is the wind speed at 2 m, and soil moisture content at different
    depths include MC-0.9TRS, MC-1.5NMM, MC-2.1NMM which are total soil moisture at
    0.9 determined with TEROS 12 soil moisture sensors as well as at 1.5 m and 2.1
    m determined by Neutron Moisture Meters. Ancillary variables were Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs), and reference
    evapotranspiration (ETr). FAO56 ETc is the calculated crop evapotranspiration
    using FAO56 single crop coefficient approach and CWSI-Th is the calculated crop
    water stress index using theoretical approach by Jackson et al. [45, 46]. For
    specific irrigated treatments as presented in Table 4, ETc ranged from 2.4 to
    13.2, 2.1 to 11.9, and 1.7 to 9.3 mm d−1 for full, deficit, and rainfed treatments,
    respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2021 where the ranges varied between 2.3
    to 10.9, 2.1 to 9.8, and 1.5 to 7.7 mm d−1 in the same order. The average ETc
    values for full, deficit, and rainfed treatments were higher in 2020 with 7.3,
    6.5, and 4.9 mm d−1 as compared to 6.0, 5.3, and 4.1 mm d−1 in 2021, respectively.
    On the other hand, CWSI was lower in full as compared to deficit and rainfed treatments.
    Higher values were seen in rainfed treatments which indicated that more stress
    occurred as a result of inadequate soil water. Generally, when CWSI ranged between
    0.4 and 0.5 (unitless) for 2020 and 0.2 and 0.5 (unitless) for 2021 indicated
    that there was no water stress in treatments. However, higher CWSI values which
    ranged between 1.1 and 1.5 (unitless) across both growing seasons were observed
    under sever water stress conditions. With theoretical CWSI it is possible to have
    CWSI > 1 outside the known range of 0 to 1 [57]. From the analysis of feature
    importance to prediction, both the permutation feature importance and random forest
    feature importance, had similar agreements as to which features were important.
    For ETc, the four most important variables included NDVI, ETr, and total soil
    water depth at 1.5 and 2.1 m, respectively (i.e., ∑ SWC @ 1.5 m, ∑ SWC @ 2.1 m);
    whereas, CWSI had only two important variables which included Rs and Ta. Therefore,
    it is suggested that features with greater importance (i.e., higher score) have
    more influence on the prediction and should be considered to fasten the process
    as well as reduce performance variations among algorithms [35]. Additionally,
    Shapley values for ETc (Fig. 4) and CWSI (Fig. 5) explained the magnitude of influence
    of each variable to the prediction of ETc and CWSI. The feature importance with
    SHAP values with plots (b), (c), and (d) for Figs. 4 and 5 help to explain the
    global contribution, whereas the SHAP values with bee warm plot showing the scattering
    of the values explains the local feature contribution [55]. Generally, the water
    fall plot (Figs. 4c, and 5c) shows values of the target or independent variable
    (E[f(x)]) which is the mean of all the predictions. The magnitude of the SHAP
    value is indicated by the length of the bar for all plots except bee warm plot
    (Figs. 4a, and 5a). For ETc prediction, ETr still contributed much to the prediction
    and had much influence, compared to Ta for CWSI. To consider the significance
    of the contribution for the entire data set, bee swarm plot was used (Figs. 4a,
    and 5a) where the blue and red hue represent high and lower predicted values.
    Therefore, both high and lower values of ETr and Ta had positive and negative
    contributions, respectively, indicating a positive correlation of both variables
    with the predicted variables. However, Tmin in ETc prediction and Rs in CWSI prediction
    both had almost no contribution to the prediction regardless of their values being
    high or low implying that they could be dropped when running model predictions.

    Model evaluations 3.3.1. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) Prediction performance
    assessment was conducted for all machine learning models on both training and
    testing sets. The testing set revealed the best model for predicting the response
    variable, ETc. As presented in Fig. 6, they were ranked from best to worst as
    Stacked-Regr > SVM > Stacked-RF > CatBoost > Weighted-Ensemble > ANN > LSTM >
    MLR > RF > kNN since they had lower ranking scores on all metrics including r2
    (Fig. 6a), RMSE (Fig. 6b), MAE (Fig. 6c), and MAPE (Fig. 6d) on 15 input combinations.
    Considering the best model which was Stacked-Regr, its performance with different
    input combinations (Table 2) from the best to worst was ranked as 4 > 2 > 3 >
    7 > 10. Based on total ranking scores for all 150 predictions, the common input
    for acceptable prediction was four, which also produced the best prediction for
    both Stacked-Regr and SVM. The input combination of four surprisingly had incomplete
    weather variables but was the best as also observed by Yamaç [25]. According to
    Yamaç [25], Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and Kc provided the best results for sugar beet ETc
    during testing with SVM as compared to RF (Tmax, Tmin, RHmax, RHmin, Rs, u2, and
    Kc) (all used variables) and kNN (Tmax, Tmin, Rs, and Kc). In their study they
    did not consider soil water content as an input, however, Talib et al. [51] noted
    that soil water content can be an important factor when modeling with AI algorithms.
    Additionally, Chen et al. [58] suggested that ML models having Ta and RH as part
    of input variables can offer higher precision with ETc estimation. On the other
    hand, adding ancillary variables based on crop growth characteristics can also
    improve model prediction. Such ancillary variables include crop phenology (i.e.,
    Kcr, NDVI) or cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs) [51] or plant growth parameters
    such as plant height or LAI [12]. Download : Download high-res image (878KB) Download

    for all ten models and fifteen input combinations on both testing and training
    sets on statistical performance metrics – a) coefficient of determination (r2),
    b) root mean square error (RMSE), c) mean absolute error (MAE), and d) mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE). Evaluated models included Artificial Intelligence models
    include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random
    Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical
    Boosting decision tree (CatBoost), as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    as the only traditional mathematical model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked
    Regression (Stacked-Regr), Stacked Random Forest (Stacked-RF), and Weighted average
    Ensemble (Weighted-Ensemble). The performance metrics on the testing set ranged
    between 0.64 and 0.99, 0.27 and 1.03 mm d−1, 0.22 and 0.81 mm d−1, and 4.5 and
    18.8% for r2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively (Fig. 7). These ranges are consistent
    with what was observed by Yamaç, [25]. The highest r2 and lowest RMSE, MAE and
    MAPE values were observed overall in the ensembled ML models particularly with
    Stacked-Regr followed by Stacked-RF and then Weighted-Ensemble; however, poor
    results were observed for LSTM and KNN. There was less overestimation or underestimation
    of the ETc when ensemble models were used as explained by lower RMSE, MAE, and
    MAPE (Fig. 7). Contrary to our results where ensembles performed better than other
    AI models, Zhang et al. [26] found CatBoost as the best among other AI models
    (i.e., RF, NN) using input weather parameters Tmax, Tmin, RH, u2, and Rn in ETc
    estimations; however, they never considered ensembling as done in this study.
    Zhang et al. [26] found the main sensitive input weather variables while estimating
    ETc which were Tmin and Tmax, but recognized that other additional variables can
    also be considered. According to Granata et al. [59], predictions of ETc without
    using Rs as one of the inputs might cause errors, therefore use of limited data
    with only temperature is not advisable. Talib et al. [51] reported that indeed
    Rs was the most important factor, more than temperature (i.e., Tmax) to improve
    the accuracy of ETc prediction. Download : Download high-res image (965KB) Download

    were a) coefficient of determination (r2), b) root mean square error (RMSE), c)

    models included Artificial Intelligence models include Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines
    (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical Boosting decision tree (CatBoost),
    as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as the only traditional mathematical
    model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked Regression (Stacked-Regr), Stacked
    Random Forest (Stacked-RF), and Weighted average Ensemble (Weighted-Ensemble).
    3.3.2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) As similarly done in ETc prediction, CWSI
    prediction was assessed with same models but now using twelve input combinations
    (Table 3). From Fig. 8 the total ranking scores displayed the best prediction
    model on testing set which was CatBoost; however, kNN deteriorated in accuracy
    on testing as compared to training among all models. Nonetheless, the performance
    on the testing set from best (low score) to worst (high score) were ranked as
    CatBoost > RF > Weighted-Ensemble > Stacked-Regr > ANN > LSTM > SVM > kNN > Stacked-RF
    > MLR. Differing from the observations in ETc prediction, ML ensembles never performed
    extremely well in CWSI estimations, except Weighted-Ensemble which performed better
    than the other ensembles. The best input combinations (Table 3) for CatBoost were
    10 > 11 > 12 > 8 > 9. Overall, CatBoost10 (i.e., CatBoost model + Input combination
    10) outperformed the rest of the models. CatBoost was the best model in estimating
    ETr among other ML models in the study done by Zhang et al. [26] and Huang et
    al. [56]. It is worth noting that the outliers exhibited among some models are
    attributed to the fact that some of the input combinations extremely over or under
    predicted CWSI and such predictions were out of the range based on the overall
    performance of the model. Download : Download high-res image (920KB) Download

    percentage error (MAPE). Evaluated models included Artificial Intelligence models
    include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random
    Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Categorical
    Boosting decision tree (CatBoost), as well as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    as the only traditional mathematical model. Machine learning ensembles were Stacked
    Regression (Stacked-Regr), Stacked Random Forest (Stacked-RF), and Weighted average
    Ensemble (Weighted-Ensemble). Focusing on individual performance metrics (Fig.
    9), model accuracy deteriorated across the models on the testing set as compared
    to the training set since lower r2 values as well as higher values with other
    metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) was observed. Nonetheless, models such as RF, kNN, and
    CatBoost remained stable with greater performances since they did not show greater
    differences in metrics for the two periods as opposed to LSTM and MLR which performed
    poorly in both periods. During the testing period, the observed ranges of r2 were
    0.40 to 0.99, RMSE ranged between 0.15 to 0.25 (unitless), MAE ranged between
    0.10 to 0.19 (unitless), and 7.9 to 15.1% for MAPE. Generally, less prediction
    errors were seen in CatBoost since it had the lowest RMSE (Fig. 9b), MAE (Fig.
    9c), and MAPE (Fig. 9d), and it was the best estimator of CWSI among all other
    models. Comparing the findings to other studies, Kumar et al. [5] found that the
    best ANN model used three input variables (RH, Ta, and Tc) and Rs was not used
    likely due to being unavailable from most weather stations. According to Kumar
    et al. [5], better predictions can be achieved with expansion of the dataset such
    that models can learn more about the data and eventually be able to predict CWSI
    satisfactorily. In addition, the wide distribution of the values could improve
    the estimation since most of the time they are clustered into small ranges which
    makes it difficult for the model to learn [5]. For future research, it is suggested
    to couple a process-based crop model which can report crop stress limits with
    a data-driven model (as done in this study) to generate more training data which
    can help improve CWSI prediction. However, it must be acknowledged that crop models
    are not able to capture the underlying natural variabilities in the field. Otherwise,
    expansion of the data to include observations from other years and experimental
    sites is required. Download : Download high-res image (959KB) Download : Download

    3.4. Performance of best AI models in the irrigated treatments compared to rainfed
    treatment 3.4.1. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) After evaluating all the models
    and identifying the best model for estimating ETc, it was then imposed on all
    selected treatments which were used to create both training and testing dataset
    for the models across the two growing seasons 2021 (Fig. 10) and 2020 (Fig. 11).
    While considering only 2021 growing season, the separation of the treatments were
    observed as water sufficiency was varied from adequate in fully irrigated maize
    to less in deficit irrigated maize and more limited in rainfed maize as shown
    in Fig. 10a. The performance of Stacked Regression was better in both full and
    deficit irrigated treatments as compared to rainfed treatment (Fig. 10b, 10c).
    Additionally, months of July and August were used since it is when maize crop
    water requirements are high and therefore on a specific day of either of those
    two months, Stacked regression performed much better in fully and deficit irrigated
    maize than in rainfed maize as presented in Fig. 10c. On the other hand, treatments
    in 2020 growing season also showed distinct differences across the treatments
    (Fig. 11a) and the AI model perfomed well for all the treatments (Fig. 11b) and
    likewise the model agreed with the calculated ETc values on most of the days for
    the considered two months as shown in Fig. 11c. Download : Download high-res image

    and c) daily ETc for two months (July and August) between FAO56 ETc approach and
    best model (i.e., Stacked Regression). 3.4.2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) The
    best model was CatBoost for predicting CWSI for irrigated treatments in comparison
    to rainfed treatment for both 2021 (Fig. 12) and 2020 (Fig. 13) growing seasons.
    There was significant difference between the treatments especially in irrigated
    versus rainfed treatments during 2021 maize growing season as presented in Fig.
    12a. Conversely, in 2020 growing season (Fig. 13a) there was small differences
    between the irrigated treatments which explains that the crop water stress was
    similar in both treatments (full and deficit). Although CWSI is said to range
    from 0 to 1, the theoretical CWSI ranged between 0 and 1.5, which was also observed
    by Katimbo et al. [57]. From the linear regression analysis for both seasons,
    the model performed better in estimating CWSI values in irrigated as compared
    to rainfed maize (Fig. 12b, Fig. 13b). However, the worst performance among rainfed
    treatments was achieved in the growing season of 2020 (Fig. 13a). For months of
    July and August in the two growing seasons, the CatBoost model performed well
    across the treatments especially in 2021 (Fig. 12c), however, it tended to overestimate
    CWSI on most days in 2020 specifically in the rainfed treatment but the performance
    improved in full and deficit treatments as observed in Fig. 13c. Download : Download

    Machine learning models have increasingly been employed to monitor or track soil
    moisture, crop water use as well as water stress [[1], [2], [5], [26], [27]].
    Hence, there is potential of using such models in irrigation scheduling tools
    or irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) particularly to forecast/estimate
    plant and soil water feedback mechanisms. In this study, CWSI was considered as
    the plant feedback mechanism and ETc with soil water balance can provide soil
    water depletion which is the soil water feedback mechanism. It is hypothesized
    that the best predicting models (e.g., CatBoost and Stacked regression for this
    study), along with collected real-time sensor data, can be used in IDSS to decide
    irrigation amount and timing. This could possibly reduce irrigation decision making
    time as well as minimize errors from uncertainties contributed by use of direct
    sensor measurements. In general, IDSS can utilize sensor data collected in real-time
    when techniques such as Internet of Things (IoTs) or Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs) are used. Recent studies have used AI models to estimate soil moisture
    for their use in irrigation management [11,1,27]; however current study explored
    the use of similar models in deriving feedbacks to support irrigation decision
    making. Future research will therefore further design and evaluate an IDSS having
    both plant and soil water feedbacks in comparison to conventional methods with
    respect to irrigation withdrawal, water use efficiency, and harvested yields.
    5. Conclusion Precise irrigation scheduling techniques are desired to improve
    water use efficiency and optimize yields in regions where water is scarce or where
    high-water demand for other sectors is experienced. This current study evaluated
    the performance of a wide range of machine learning models in predicting crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) whose predictions
    were compared to calculated values from standard mathematical models - single
    crop coefficient FAO56 ETc and Jackson''s theoretical CWSI computation. Among
    a total of ten machine learning models evaluated, it was found that Stacked Regression
    with inputs Tmin, Tmax, RH, and ∑SWC @ 0.9 m performed best in estimating ETc.
    Conversely, CatBoost with inputs including Ta, Rs, VPD, RH, u2, and ∑SWC @ 0.9
    m was the best in predicting CWSI. Future research will involve use of these two
    models along with the best input combinations in developing an irrigation decision
    support system (IDSS) which will have both plant (as CWSI) and soil water feedback
    (as soil water depletion) mechanisms. Additionally, designed IDSS will be compared
    to conventional irrigation scheduling methods to determine if it can optimize
    yields or improve water use efficiency with reduced irrigation water withdrawals.

  description: Summer maize under different water and fertilizer treatments was used
    as the main line of research. Images were collected by using UAV remote sensing
    system. By analyzing the spectral data and the maize growth indexes measured on
    the ground, we clarify the effects of different water and fertilizer treatments
    on the growth indexes of summer maize and construct a crop growth index monitoring
    model based on spectral perception.The results showed that different irrigation
    and fertilization treatments significantly affected summer maize plant height,
    and the spectrally calculated plant height values were all highly significantly
    correlated with the measured values at the P< 0.0001 level. R2 of the coefficient
    of determination for different periods in 2020 were 0.354, 0.483, 0.672, and 0.702,
    respectively and in 2021 were 0.314, 0.410, 0.426, and 0.466, respectively. Growth
    period data fusion can greatly improve inversion accuracy of plant height, with
    goodness of fit of 0.946 and 0.906, respectively in 2020 and 2021. There was a
    good correlation between multi-spectral vegetation index and summer maize biomass
    under different water and fertilizer treatments. The inversion model for 2020
    maize biomass constructed using the Cubist algorithm performed best. Growth period
    data fusion greatly improved the inversion superiority of the model. Three models
    (SVR, Cubist and RF model) constructed by the three algorithms all had excellent
    performance on the 2021 data set, with R2 on the test set reaching 0.942, 0.941
    and 0.934, respectively.

    Keywords: UAV; IoT; satellite; Precision Agriculture; proximal sensing; remote
    sensing; challenges 1. Introduction Worldwide food production is a more sensitive
    issue than ever before. The global population is expected to reach 10 billion
    by 2050, adding an extra 2.4 billion to the global urban population, and increasing
    overall demand for food production by 70 percent [1]. At the same time, reduced
    rural population, degraded farmlands [2], climate change decreasing agricultural
    productivity [3], and food waste [4] make this requirement quite difficult to
    meet unless the agricultural productive model changes dramatically. To this end,
    Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth Agricultural Revolution, promises a technological
    revolution for enhanced agricultural productivity and increased eco-efficiency
    [5]. Driven by the wider Industry 4.0 paradigm shift, Agriculture 4.0 brings to
    the agricultural sector a number of mainstream technologies, including sensing
    infrastructures, big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and
    robotics [6]. It thus engages in a unifying model pertinent to different domains
    of human activity ([7,8]), recognizing cyberphysical systems and their components
    as a key element in this transition [9] and targeting an increase in the overall
    quality of life leading to Society 5.0 paradigm [10]. Sensing plays an important
    role in the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm shift. Obtaining the necessary information
    from the field may be achieved by exploiting different technological options that
    include ground-based sensors, or remote sensing techniques ([11,12]). The former
    are strongly associated with technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT)
    ([13,14]) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [15], as well as Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) [16]. The latter may be distinguished from airborne remote
    sensing utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and spaceborne remote sensing
    exploiting satellite data. The present work performs a systematic review related
    to the three aforementioned main technologies with reference to their application
    in agriculture. The main research questions (RQs) that the authors wish to answer
    in this work are the following: RQ1 What are the challenges of the three technologies
    that this work deals with? RQ2 How can these three technologies be used in a complementary
    way so as to facilitate the transition to Agriculture 4.0? The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows. An overview of the three aforementioned categories of
    sensing technologies is presented in Section 2. The methodology followed for the
    systematic review is showcased in Section 3. The outcome of the literature review
    performed is elaborated in Section 4 detailing the challenges and synergies found
    for the three technologies under investigation. Section 5 presents a discussion
    providing the paper’s view on the research questions formulated. Finally, Section
    6 presents conclusions and identifies potential future research directions. 2.
    Overview of Sensing Technologies 2.1. Ground-Based Sensing Ground or proximal
    sensors play a key role in Precision Agriculture (PA). Proximal sensing is defined
    as the use of field sensors to obtain signals from the analyzed feature (e.g.,
    climate, soil, or plant) when the sensor is in contact with or close to it (within
    a few meters) ([17,18]). Nowadays, there are many types of proximal sensors capable
    of monitoring multiple parameters related mainly to the plant water, nutritional,
    and health status [19]. Another classification includes the division into static
    proximal sensors, which remain stationary in the field, or mobile proximal sensors,
    mounted on vehicles or robots [20]. It is well known that climate is one of the
    main aspects determining plant growth and outputs [21]. This occurs because each
    plant is sensitive to certain growing conditions such as air temperature, relative
    humidity, wind, soil temperature, and light. Thus, it is crucial for farmers to
    understand the climatic conditions on their farms [22]. Hence, meteorological
    information may help the farmer make the most efficient use of natural resources
    to improve agricultural production. Among the most common proximal sensors are
    those that can assess climatic parameters. Usually, such sensors are mounted in
    small weather stations in the field, and a basic weather station usually consists
    of a temperature and humidity sensor, a wind speed sensor, a sensor that measures
    precipitation height, and one that can assess solar radiation information. Another
    category of ground-based sensors is soil-based sensors. New-generation proximal
    soil-based sensors are able to monitor real-time physical and chemical soil parameters,
    such as moisture, temperature, pH, soil nutrients, and pollutants, providing key
    information to optimize crop cycle management, combat biotic and abiotic stresses,
    and improve crop yields. One of the most common uses of such sensing is for irrigation
    management, through the capability of estimating the crop reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO), returning to the plant the full or partial (depending on the farm irrigation
    strategy) amount of water lost by evapotranspiration, using the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith
    equation recommended by the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) [23]. Weather observations and forecasts, coupled with physical observations,
    can help predict the development of the main pests and can be used to schedule
    control actions to prevent pest development. Thanks to such information, it is
    possible to change plant microclimate and influence the habitability for pests,
    for example, through pruning operations to reduce internal canopy humidity and
    reduce the probability of infection by plant pathogens. Integrated pest management
    has been a response to reduce the environmental impact of chemical pesticides
    [24]. For irrigation scheduling nowadays, there is a tendency to focus on plant-based
    sensors. Common and reliable sensors capable of continuously estimating plant
    water status include leaf turgor sensors, devices capable of assessing leaf turgor
    pressure, a parameter directly related to plant water status; sapflow sensors,
    capable of providing indications of the plant transpiration flows; trunk dendrometers,
    capable of monitoring trunk fluctuations over time, dependent on the plant hydration
    status; and Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) fruit gauges [25].
    The latter are low-cost devices that can continuously and very accurately monitor
    fruit development over the day, providing information about plant water and nutritional
    status during the fruit growth stage ([26,27]). Although plant-based sensors for
    monitoring plant water status are among the most common, there are other devices
    that are very useful for crop management. Foliar wetness sensors are devices installed
    inside the canopy to assess its moisture status, preventing the rise of pathogens
    and diseases [28]. Optical sensors, working in the visible/near-infrared band,
    can be useful for estimating the nutritional and health status of the plant ([29,30]).
    On the other hand, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology sensors can
    be used to assess and measure canopy shape and volume [31]. Last-generation sensors
    allow continuous data acquisition, greatly increasing the degree of information
    without increasing the farm workload. Moreover, these sensors can be used to create
    IoT networks for various applications [32]. IoT focuses primarily on providing
    many small, interconnected devices, mainly using WSN technology, that can work
    together with a common purpose [33]. A WSN has as a main target of offering sensing
    and monitoring capabilities utilizing wireless technologies to connect to sensing
    devices. In WSNs, data collection and transfer occur in four stages: collecting
    the data, processing the data, packaging the data, and transferring the data [34].
    With the help of WSN technologies, farmers can analyze weather conditions, water
    use, energy use, soil conditions, and plant morpho-physiological parameters collected
    from their farm feeding decision-support systems (DSSs) [35]. WSN has to fulfill
    requirements such as long range, low energy, and adequate data rate. Several technologies,
    including Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) [36], Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)
    [37], SigFox [38], and Long-Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M) [39], are arising
    as candidates in the upcoming transition to 5G communications [40]. In the context
    of this paper, and from this point on, we use the term IoT to collectively describe
    the different technologies associated with ground-based proximal sensing. 2.2.
    Remote Sensing Techniques UAVs were used in agriculture in 1997 for the first
    time. This technology was first used in Japan and South Korea, where mountainous
    terrain and relatively small family-owned farms required lower-cost and higher-precision
    spraying. Historically, the use of aerial application of pesticides was prohibited
    by the European Union, inhibiting the growth of UAV application in agriculture.
    Later use of UAVs was centered mainly around aerial imagery. Nowadays, UAVs are
    applied in PA to collect images of high quality, mounting adequate sensors to
    this end. Sensor choice is carried out carefully according to a number of parameters
    such as resolution, optical quality, weight, captured images, and price. UAVs
    may carry multiple types of sensors: RGB (red–green–blue), NIR (near-infrared),
    IR (infrared), multispectral (MS), and hyperspectral (HS) cameras. RGB and NIR
    bands are useful for collecting information about vegetation stress and chlorophyll
    content [41]. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors can also be used in environmental sciences
    for terrestrial scanning, obtaining information on crop height or canopy size
    [42]. Each type of sensor can be utilized for monitoring diverse parameters in
    vegetation. RGB is low in cost and useful for UAV applications of precision farming,
    such as the creation of orthomosaics, as they can capture images with high resolution.
    In addition, they are useful in different conditions (sunny and cloudy weather).
    But they cannot analyze many vegetation indices due to their limited spectral
    range. MS and HS sensors, compared to RGB, collect data in different spectral
    channels and acquire images with high quality that are useful for studying a multitude
    of physical and biological characteristics of plantations [43]. Therefore, MS
    and HS sensors are the most popular in PA, although they are expensive. Moreover,
    thermal sensors are used to collect temperature information. Their use proves
    to be optimal in irrigation-management applications [43]. The specific targeted
    application type is what dictates the adequate selection of sensors. For instance,
    MS sensors are suitable for the detection of diseases, offering many bands that
    can detect the sensitivity of symptoms. On the other hand, one RGB camera should
    be enough for data collection related to agricultural mapping. The most well-known
    applications of UAVs for PA, as found in the literature, include weed mapping
    and management [44], irrigation management [45], crop spraying [46], vegetation
    health monitoring and diseases detection [47], and vegetation growth monitoring
    and yield estimation [43]. UAVs acquire information that can be useful for the
    measurement of different parameters such as the crop height and the Leaf Area
    Index (LAI), allowing crop growth control in crops such as cotton, wheat, or sorghum.
    UAVs can be used to calculate the most common vegetative index to determine the
    diseased tissue, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which
    is useful for monitoring crop health and detecting diseases at an early stage,
    also mapping the size of the defect. In addition, a very important field of UAV
    application is water management, as precision irrigation techniques improve the
    efficiency of water use resources [43]. UAVs have rapidly evolved into a common
    tool to increase agricultural output and overall efficiency, decreasing expensive
    inputs of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. They can also indicate damages in
    crops that cannot be easily detected from the ground and be applicable in areas
    of big dimensions [48]. Finally, spaceborne remote sensing satellites equipped
    with digital RGB cameras and MS or HS sensors are nowadays among the most widely
    used technologies in monitoring field variability, which usually includes landscape
    monitoring, yield, field, soil and crop variability, or variability due to anomalous
    factors [49]. By measuring the reflectance of the light incident on soil and crops,
    they are used to assess their characteristics and behavior by acquiring information
    at different spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolutions. Similarly
    to UAV-based remote sensing, information acquired from satellites is usually expressed
    by indices, among which the NDVI index is one of the most widely used. Each index
    is calculated from values at visible and non-visible wavelengths: red, green,
    blue, near-infrared, red edge, and infrared bands are the most frequently used
    ([12,50]). Every satellite and sensor is characterized by different spatial and
    temporal resolutions. Temporal resolution is associated with the satellite itself
    and can be considered as the time the satellite takes to complete an orbit and
    revisit the same observation area. Sensors, instead, can have high spatial resolution
    and tend to have small footprints, or they have low spatial resolution and tend
    to have larger footprints. As Vanguard 2 and TIROS 1 were launched in 1959 and
    1960, respectively, and are used for assessing meteorological information, the
    history of satellites for agricultural use starts in 1972 with Landsat 1 (1972–1978),
    a satellite capturing multispectral data for earth-surface image acquisition.
    After that, a series of Landsat satellites (from 2 to 9) were launched. Used in
    many parts of the world, these satellites (Landsat-7, -8, and -9 are still active)
    provide high-quality images in order to classify land uses, monitor crop conditions,
    and estimate irrigation water requirements, resulting in more affordable imagery
    than the aerial photography once used to classify land use across large regions.
    Later, from the end of the 1990s to the 2010s, other satellites were launched,
    such as IKONOS (1999–2015), which provides 4 m spatial resolution images; Worldview-2
    (2009–present); and GeoEye-1 (2008–present), with a ≤2 m resolution; Sentinel-2A
    (2014–present) and -2B (2015–present), with a 10 to 60 m resolution; and other
    satellites constellations such as Pleiades-1A (2011–present) and -1B (2012–present),
    SkySat-1 (2013–present) and -2 (2014–present), or Superview-1 (2016–present),
    namely small satellites with compact, cheaper, and more replaceable sensors [51].
    The primary benefits of this type of technology use are widely documented in the
    literature and include reduced environmental impact, increased crop yield, enhanced
    product quality, and input savings ([52,53,54]). Despite the number and variety
    of satellite data being made available at various costs and for different purposes,
    there are certain challenges to using satellite imaging closely related to the
    purpose of the study. 3. Methodology The present review was conducted following
    the guidelines set by the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) methodology [55]. The PRISMA statement consists
    of a checklist of 27 items recommended for reporting in systematic literature
    reviews. This checklist was designed to help reviewers report the purpose of the
    review, the methodology that was followed, and the outcomes of their research.
    This section provides answers to the PRISMA 2020 statement item checklist, giving
    a comprehensive illustration of the methodology followed in the present work.
    As the technology of sensors rapidly advances, a review of current literature
    in PA is needed to put into scope the available technologies, their competition,
    the cases that are most favorable for their application, and how to best utilize
    them in unison to maximize agricultural sustainability and profit for farmers.
    This review was conducted with the mindset of bringing to the fore the challenges
    of the three technologies that currently play a central role in the future of
    PA and sustainable development. To the knowledge of the authors, a systematic
    review with the scope of attempting to synthesize the literature for these three
    technologies has not been attempted before, testifying to the novelty of the current
    work. This study answers the two RQs that were mentioned in the introduction.
    According to the RQs, the following search query was formulated: TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (“Precision Agriculture” AND (((UAV OR Satellite) AND “Remote Sensing”) OR IoT))
    All results obtained from this query also had to fulfil the following criteria:
    Should be written in English, Should be published after 2017, Should be published
    in Q1 and Q2 journals. All studies that met the criteria proceeded to the first
    screening phase. During this phase, all six authors split the remaining papers
    between themselves and skimmed through the abstract and the main text for phrases
    mentioning challenges or synergies for the three technologies. At this phase,
    only phrases were sought. All works that survived this stage passed through a
    second screening phase, during which remaining works were split between two reviewers
    and carefully read through. The reviewers had to ascertain to what degree each
    study analysed the challenge or the synergy it mentioned. If the analysis of the
    challenge or synergy was profound enough, the work was finally admitted for inclusion.
    The aforementioned query and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database
    on 6 October 2022. The explanation for the choice of this query was that the application
    of these three technologies in PA was sought for sensing purposes; therefore,
    “remote sensing” was added with an AND for UAVs and satellites to exclude other
    uses, e.g., spraying. Furthermore, the term “IoT” was regarded as more appropriate
    when paired with “Precision Agriculture” to provide a representative set of relevant
    works, and was preferred over terms such as “Wireless Sensor Networks” or “Ground
    Sensors”. The aforementioned query produced a result of 435 articles. Out of these,
    383 were articles published in Q1 and Q2 journals. These 383 articles were divided
    equally among the six authors for the first screening phase. Articles that had
    no mention of challenges, or synergy of technologies, were eliminated. The first
    screening phase eliminated a further 172 works. Therefore, 211 works made it to
    the second screening phase, during which 24 works were excluded, leading to a
    total of 187 articles. Looking through these 187 records, it was evident that
    synergies were underrepresented, as only 6 works mentioned a substantial synergy.
    Citation searching had to be performed to ensure that the contemporary literature
    on synergies was adequately represented. Citation searching added a further 18
    records, for a total of 205 records to be admitted for inclusion in the final
    review. Figure 1 presents a flowchart giving an overview of the screening phases
    and the steps followed for the systematic literature review. Figure 1. Systematic
    Literature Review Flowchart. During the second screening phase, all challenges
    found by the authors were added to a spreadsheet. Subsequently, these challenges
    were grouped together. These groups can be found in Table 1 and Table 2 for UAVs,
    Table 3 and Table 4 for satellites, and Table 5 and Table 6 for IoT. Papers that
    mentioned synergies where sparse among the body of results. These works are described
    in their own Section 4.4. Table 1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Technological
    Challenges for Applications in Agriculture. Table 2. UAV Peripheral Challenges
    for Applications in Agriculture. Table 3. Satellite Technological Challenges for
    Applications in Agriculture. Table 4. Satellite Peripheral Challenges for Applications
    in Agriculture. Table 5. Internet of Things (IoT) Technological Challenges for
    Applications in Agriculture. Table 6. IoT Peripheral Challenges for Applications
    in Agriculture. In order to give a sufficient definition of what a challenge is
    and what a synergy is, we refer to the following. A challenge is any type of impedance
    or problem that challenges the use of a particular technology in PA. For example,
    for UAVs, a challenge could be their short flight times, for satellites their
    lower resolution, and for ground sensors their inflexibility. Synergy is an idea
    that fuses together traits from two or more technologies to produce an effect
    that improves the use of both and augments each technology’s value overall. The
    high-resolution images acquired by UAV, combined with the wide coverage and high
    spectral resolution of satellite images, constitutes a good example of a synergy.
    Both challenges and synergies were sought in all examined papers, with the prerequisite
    that they were sufficiently analyzed in the review text. Therefore, it was much
    more probable to encounter UAV challenges in a UAV-centric paper than in an IoT-centric
    or a satellite-centric paper. To reduce bias, the two first authors double-checked
    the findings of each of the six authors during the second phase of deciding paper
    eligibility. Any paper that mentioned a well-analysed and evidence-supported phrase
    that met the challenge or synergy criteria was eligible for synthesis. During
    the second screening, a further 24 papers were excluded. After this step, the
    number of records was reduced to 187. Out of those papers, six of them discussed
    a synergy of the technologies. Citation searching was performed to identify more
    records mentioning synergies, which added another 18 records, for a total of 205.
    Synthesis of the results required that the phrases extracted from each paper described,
    in their core, the same basic challenge in order to be grouped with similar phrases
    from other papers. For example, papers mentioning UAV instability when carrying
    heavy equipment and UAV reduction in flight time due to heavy payloads were all
    grouped under the payload-limitation challenge because they describe the wider
    challenge that UAVs face when there is need to equip them with heavy payloads.
    As each challenge is further elaborated upon in the main text, the particular
    details of each phrase are not lost. The grouping helps to provide a summary of
    the challenge in a form that is quick and easy on the eye and captures how many
    works have mentioned it in the past. 4. Results This section presents the results
    for the synthesis of the challenges for each technology in three subsections and
    the results for synergies in the fourth subsection. 4.1. UAV Challenges This subsection
    provides the results of the categorization of challenges for UAV technology. Table
    2 presents the types of challenges for implementing UAV technology in agriculture
    that are peripherally related to the use of UAVs. The categories that were observed
    in this case were economic, social, and governmental challenges, as well as one
    miscellaneous challenge. Table 1 presents the type of challenges for implementing
    UAV technology in agriculture that are native to the UAV technology, and hence,
    occur according to the UAV system itself. The categories that were observed in
    this case were challenges concerning the sensors, the system security, the data
    processing, and the system hardware. Moreover, future research challenges for
    implementing UAV technology in agriculture are also investigated and included.
    Figure 2 presents these groups of challenges found in the literature that was
    examined. Figure 2. UAV Challenges Mentioned in the Literature. Most commercially
    available UAVs come out of the box with cheap RGB sensors that lack the precision
    and spectral range for PA applications (for example, for calculating NVDI) [58].
    It is necessary to equip UAVs with MS sensors, increasing the overall cost, and
    even then, cheaper MS sensors face saturation issues [59], especially since there
    are no standardized methods for their calibration [72]. The calibration of UAV
    sensors presents a challenge because camera position on a UAV might be slightly
    different for each flight [59], and differences in the orientation of the sensor
    result in different calibrations each time. This is especially true with HS sensors,
    as the slightest tilt has a negative impact in the sensor calibration [80]. With
    reference to HS sensors, although they have become more lightweight and cheaper,
    they are still a relatively expensive investment, and the processing of their
    output data remains extremely complex. Therefore, UAVs present a less cost-effective
    option for high spectral resolution when compared to satellites [129]. According
    to [71], another challenge for UAVs is their dependence on payload. Equipping
    the UAV with multiple sensors is not recommended, as it reduces flight time and
    affects its balance mid-flight ([81,86]). Therefore, careful choice must be made
    about which sensors to use and equip the platform with during each flight, resulting
    in the need for multiple flights when measurements from multiple sensors are required.
    All data generated as an outcome of the UAV trips need to be processed to be useful.
    Some issues arise during this stage. As sensors become better and spatial resolution
    increases, the volume of acquired data increases, and UAV use in PA is faced with
    extreme data bloat ([81,110,111]). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, data acquisition
    is not standardized, adding to the already considerable computing complexity of
    UAV images ([57,86]). On top of that, the UAV itself can do little to share the
    burden of data processing as its computing capabilities are very limited ([81,111]).
    When these ultra-high resolution data are used for machine learning (ML) training,
    it can take quite a while to complete ([72,106]), even though the final results
    are more trustworthy and useful than training the ML algorithms with satellite
    acquired images. Higher resolution is not always a panacea when it is employed
    for disease classification. The currently developed plant disease classification
    methods have maximum resolution thresholds, which, when surpassed, result in their
    algorithm underperforming. Nevertheless, the highest resolutions can be capitalized
    on in object recognition algorithms that perform disease analysis at the individual
    plant level [117]. Another issue is that if these data are to be given to some
    company or organization for processing, issues of data governance arise, as well
    as security of sensitive data ([64,72,82]). Furthermore, as the usage of UAVs
    in agriculture is still in an early stage [123], more research is needed to identify
    the costs and benefits of the implementation of this technology. For example,
    [125] recommended the actualization of more studies concerning the validation
    of low-cost sensors’ results in different conditions. Moreover, according to [71,82],
    there is a need for the development of fully autonomous UAVs. Ref. [79] also discussed
    the implementation of multiple coordinated UAVs in an individual field. Finally,
    the path optimization of UAVs, in order to monitor a whole field with adequate
    accuracy, is mentioned in [71,75]. UAVs’ application challenges exceed the purely
    technical aspects. Using a UAV for PA requires a large upfront investment from
    farmers ([118,127]), and even then, continuous use can be expensive as well [86].
    This high initial cost is a considerable risk, as remote sensing is not a standardized
    procedure for every type of crop and in every environment, and its performance
    can wildly vary depending on these parameters [86]. The need for skills and a
    proper way of handling UAVs ([58,66,132]) are further impeding factors. Knowledge
    of repair and maintenance is also a requirement [64]. Moreover, most governments
    require special licences for UAV use, and they limit certain aspects of flying,
    such as flying height ([71,93]), and flying over inhabited areas and beyond visual
    lines [88]. 4.2. Satellite Challenges The present subsection provides the results
    of the categorization of challenges for satellites. Table 4 presents the type
    of challenges for using satellites in agriculture, which are not oriented to the
    technology itself. The categories that were observed in this case were economic
    and social. Table 3 presents the challenges native to satellite technology. Of
    this type of challenges, the main categories that were identified were related
    to sensors, security, data processing, and the platform. In addition, some future
    research challenges are also mentioned and analyzed. Figure 3 presents these groups
    of challenges found in the literature that was examined. Figure 3. Satellite Challenges
    Mentioned in the Literature. An important drawback of satellite imagery is its
    lower spatial resolution compared to airborne images ([101,135]). Satellite images
    of medium or low spatial resolution are freely available but do not provide adequate
    data for a handful of different PA uses, such as disease monitoring, soil spectral
    measurement, wild weed identification, or applications that require individual
    plant identification through ML ([136,137,138]). Very-high-resolution (VHR) images
    from satellites are also available but incur a significant cost. Even then, VHR
    satellites have trouble in applications that require object identification in
    agricultural environments, as they provide less information than their airborne
    counterparts. Due to this lower spatial resolution, satellites are not optimal
    for heterogeneous environments, for example, for the size and distribution of
    most of the European olive grove systems or vineyards ([142,159]). Similarly to
    UAVs, satellites generate big data images. Their processing is a time-consuming
    and computationally intensive endeavour [144]. Processing these data under time
    constraints may affect the quality of the final result [148]. Storing and managing
    the sheer volumes of imagery is a considerable challenge on its own. Furthermore,
    satellite data, because of their low spatial and temporal resolution, are not
    great candidates for AI calibration purposes or training of ML algorithms [149].
    As with all big data applications, satellite imagery can also be leaked or be
    used by third parties for unknown purposes, so care must be taken ([72,142]).
    Another drawback of satellites is their susceptibility to cloudy weather. Depending
    on cloud coverage, a satellite may not be able to acquire images at all [151].
    The consensus in the literature is that cloud coverage reduces satellite temporal
    resolution ([83,149]). Disease monitoring in particular is highly dependent on
    high temporal resolution; thus, satellite use for this particular application
    is inappropriate [158]. Satellites as a platform have inherently low temporal
    resolution, as they cannot be used for imaging at will but rather at their particular
    revisit time, but if at that moment the cloud coverage is dense, the chance for
    image acquisition may be lost. While satellites bearing active sensors are a solution
    to cloud coverage, their spatial resolution is even lower, and hence they do not
    solve the disease-monitoring conundrum ([57,64]). The low temporal resolution
    of satellites is a problem not only for disease monitoring but for monitoring
    in general. Satellites are inflexible platforms without the ability to interchange
    sensors at will, and waiting for a satellite with a suitable sensor for the required
    measurement is another cause of low temporal resolution. When the highest spatial
    resolution is needed from VHR satellites, they may not be there to provide it
    ([64,83]), but a very small number of satellites are equipped with both MS and
    HS sensors [129]. With reference to future research challenges, there is a need
    to sufficiently integrate and connect satellites with different technologies and
    devices, as well as enhance their level of cooperation between one another [142].
    According to [121], there is also the need to perform more research for satellites
    on transforming image classification maps into application maps. Additionally,
    as the complexity of the usage of a satellite platform is a factor that hinders
    its adoption, the overall technology needs to become more approachable for farmers
    and be used as a DSS [155]. Concerning the satellite technology’s peripheral challenges
    for applications in agriculture, the cost of acquiring useful information from
    satellite imagery incorporates the costs of taking the images and processing them.
    Specialized companies gather the imagery from specific satellites and process
    them themselves before finally delivering the final product to the customer. Satellite
    data for PA have been in use for many years, more than UAVs, and the whole process
    is more streamlined. Still, the cost of the man-hours involved is high, particularly
    when data processing must be undertaken quickly [57]. All in all, access to everyone
    is still hindered due to the scientific and technological knowledge required to
    deploy an effective method that brings true and valuable results to farmers [131].
    4.3. IoT Challenges The present subsection provides the outcomes of the categorization
    of challenges for IoT technology. Table 6 presents the type of challenges for
    implementing IoT in agriculture that are not native to the technology itself.
    The categories that were identified from this case were mainly economic, social,
    and governmental. Table 5 presents the IoT-technology-oriented challenges. From
    this group of challenges, the main categories that were observed were related
    to sensors, security, networking, data processing, and future research challenges.
    Figure 4 presents these groups of challenges found in the literature that was
    examined. Figure 4. IoT Challenges Mentioned in the Literature. Each sensor in
    an IoT context comprises four parts: a sensing part, a computing part, a transmitting
    part, and a battery. The batteries are usually not rechargeable or changeable.
    Therefore, there is a pressing need for saving energy ([166,167,169,170]). Most
    of its energy is spent in transmitting sensed data back to the main station. Energy
    saving can be achieved by using operations with a low duty cycle, minimizing delays,
    or optimizing routing. Another challenge for IoT is the lack of reliable measurements
    for low-cost ground sensors [175]. For example, the measurement of soil moisture
    with ground sensors is challenging because the capacitive soil moisture sensors
    operate at low frequencies and are sensitive to the soil texture and salinity
    level [193]. The placement of sensors is another important challenge of incorporating
    IoT. Sensors have to be placed strategically to ensure maximum coverage and well-established
    communication between them ([91,175,192]). The difficulty of this task is proportional
    to the size of the field. As size increases, the placement of sensors becomes
    more difficult, and the cost of implementing a critical mass of sensors increases
    as well. This is known as the scalability problem ([168,172]). Harsh environmental
    conditions is another factor impeding ground sensors ([166,184]). Meteorological
    variables such as snow, fog, and solar radiance have an impact on both the sensor
    network and the planting [185]. The electrodes of low-cost sensors suffer deterioration
    quite quickly, and it is important to somehow ensure protection from adverse conditions
    [175]. Underground sensors constitute a solution to this problem, as meteorological
    phenomena do not affect them, and they do not impact the above-ground activities
    of machinery or animals, but at the cost of limited range due to interference
    by soil elements [191]. Another challenge for IoT is the need for sensor specialization,
    for each crop or disease in need of monitoring. They should be tailored to the
    needs of wildly different sectors in agriculture such as fruits, arable crops,
    or trees ([188,189,190]). Furthermore, all these sensors create electronic waste
    when they finally expire, and some of them contain harmful chemicals that are
    toxic to soils, crops, and stored grains [167]. Moving on, the architecture of
    the network is an important aspect of designing an IoT solution. Integrating data
    sources and distributed sensors is complicated [204]. IoT system design in PA
    is based on heterogeneous network topologies that lead to complex communications.
    IoT devices have to communicate and interact seamlessly through different platforms
    and infrastructures [168]. This is worsened by non-standardized data-communication
    protocols [166] and different IoT node synchronization [177], as communication
    protocols differ from crop to crop [175]. Another important aspect is the network
    layer itself. WiFi communications are not ideal for agricultural applications,
    which usually face extreme weather conditions and have insufficient power structure,
    particularly when devices are spread far over a field, and they work on non-rechargeable
    battery power [167]. On the other hand, cellular communication suffers in agriculture,
    as the operational area is far away from antennae of cellular networks, and thus
    the connectivity of 3G/4G is very low. Moreover, 4G cannot support ultra-low latency
    with high connectivity because it allows IP-based packet switching connectivity
    [171]. LoRaWAN has arisen as a replacement for WiFi/cellular networks in agricultural
    IoT. While it has low bandwidth, it boasts very low energy consumption and high
    connectivity across vast distances [175]. Its drawbacks are that its radio-based
    signals are affected by vegetation foliage ([175,185,186]). Another defect is
    its high latency [166], but this is not always a problem in agricultural application,
    except if a real-time approach is taken to field monitoring. From the point of
    view of the data processing challenge, reference is made to data bloat in [189].
    Existing cloud-base storage does not provide useful solutions to the problem of
    manipulating the different data patterns produced by the IoT [168]. The analysis
    of these data is another challenge. According to [188], it has to be simplified
    so that it can be easily understood by most farmers. Moreover, computational efficiency
    needs to increase on the agricultural domain, and it remains a challenge to come
    up with efficient alternatives to provide sufficient resources to IoT in rural
    environments [206]. IoT networks that use WiFi—or cellular—for their network infrastructure
    are more vulnerable to hacking attacks ([192,197]). A malicious party can infiltrate
    the network and cause a wide number of issues to the IoT network. Attacks can
    target various aspects such as the network itself, its nodes, the data it transmits,
    and the code by which nodes operate. The purpose of these attacks could be brute
    attempts to disrupt the network and cease its operation, or more subtle malicious
    attacks, such as data theft and faulty operation of sensors that lead to miscalculations
    and false measurements ([199,200,203]). Authentication, encryption, and securely
    generated passwords are required to prevent security compromise [168]. LoRaWAN,
    as it does not use the Internet and has already authentication and encryption
    systems built-in, has a higher degree of security. Furthermore, the data governance
    of IoT is another issue. Whoever processes the data extracted by the IoT has full
    access to sensitive information, and care must be taken about whom farmers entrust
    these data to [200]. Future research on agricultural IoT systems may focus on
    many different aspects. An important one is power management. Batteries of sensors
    that are self-rechargeable through solar power or other means would greatly enhance
    the capabilities of agricultural IoT ([166,190,201]). Research on an IoT capability
    to monitor crops in real time is another important characteristic of sensor networks
    that is constrained by the limited power resources [204]. Ground robots bearing
    moving sensors need improvement in guidance systems to achieve smooth navigation
    through a farming environment [212]. The technology’s approachability for farmers
    is another issue in need of improvement. The ergonomic design of sensors, so that
    they can be better integrated into the farming environment, and the facilitation
    of IoT device implementation in a “plug-and-play” manner are desirable improvements.
    Finally, there are numerous voices claiming that the 5G network could revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, but concerns have been raised regarding the absolute
    validity of those claims. To start with, there will be high infrastructure costs,
    because additional stations are needed due to 5G’s shorter range. The end users’
    device cost would be higher, as would service tariffs [171]. Moreover, there are
    doubts that 5G is an environmentally friendly technology, as widespread deployment
    would translate to higher use of computing devices and an increase in energy demand
    to power the computing devices, which would exacerbate climate change. It is also
    worth noting that certain reports have raised concerns about 5G’s high radiation
    [167]. When it comes to IoT peripheral challenges, the most commonly mentioned
    among the papers analysed was the high costs of implementation. According to [64],
    the measurement of ground-based parameters can be costly and time-consuming, as
    well as requiring large amounts of human resources. Furthermore, Ref. [166] described
    the business issue of implementing an IoT-based system with three categories,
    the setup cost, the running cost, and the upgrading cost. All of these categories
    can incur high costs for farmers, making the adoption of IoT in agriculture a
    dilemma. Besides economic challenges, there is also a lack of theoretical and
    practical knowledge about such systems [166], and there is always a problem with
    the farmers’ lack of awareness for implementing new technologies in their farms
    [192], or even hesitance of the farmers to use them [165]. Finally, as these technologies
    are still at the infant stage of development, there is also a lack of policies
    and regulations [218], as well as ownership and processing issues related to the
    generated data [166]. 4.4. Synergies Mentioned in the Literature Works that present
    substantial synergies between technologies are sparse. This subsection summarises
    the review findings. While data fusion between different sensors for agriculture
    has been explored in previous works [225,226], the particularities of fusing or
    combining sensory output originating from two or more sources as diverse as IoT,
    UAV, and satellites has not been touched upon adequately for agricultural purposes.
    Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021 [225] gives a thorough review of the literature from
    2021 and before, which mentions the synergical use of satellites and UAVs for
    agriculture, but it does not mention combinations of IoT and any of the two aforementioned
    technologies. The current work attempts to take the reasoning of [225] one step
    further by focusing on the particularities of each paper reviewed and dissecting
    the exact reasons that make the use of a synergy desirable. These reasons can
    be traced back to the challenges mentioned in Section 4.1–Section 4.3, as the
    complementary use of two or more technologies attempts to mitigate the limitations
    and challenges each technology faces on its own. Table 7 and Table 8 present the
    logic permeating each type of synergy encountered during the literature review
    by contrasting its complementary technological traits. Table 9, Table 10 and Table
    11, describe the use cases of synergies performed in relevant works and characterize
    them according to the particular synergy types as defined in Table 7 and Table
    8. Table 7. UAV and Satellite Synergy Types. Table 8. UAV/Satellite and IoT Synergy
    Types. Table 9. Synergies Part 1. Table 10. Synergies Part 2. Table 11. Synergies
    Part 3. Among UAV-Satellite papers, Type 3 and Type 5 synergies are the most common.
    Interestingly, only two papers have utilized the flexibility of the UAV, and only
    two papers have utilized its enhanced capacity to create 3D point clouds, while
    no work combining UAV and satellite requires the historical records of past satellite
    overpasses. Among IoT-UAV/Satellite works, Type 8 was the most common, utilizing
    the proximity of IoT measurements to clear up uncertainties in UAV/satellite remote
    sensing. Type 10 and Type 12 are the next most commonly mentioned synergies. Most
    Type 10 synergies utilise meteorological data in ML models to complement remote
    sensing predictions, while Type 12’s use of historical satellite data was quite
    common in contrast with UAV–Satellite papers. Type 9 and Type 11 are only encountered
    once, since real-time ground sensor monitoring is still in its infancy as a practice,
    and attempts to perform orthorectification through ground measurements are also
    scarce. Synergy Type 7 constitutes an exception, as it is commonly encountered
    across a very large number of scientific papers, which were not reviewed, as they
    were considered outside the scope of the current work. While synergical use can
    mitigate certain liabilities and provide solutions, there are some challenges
    that are shared by two of the technologies examined or even by all three. Therefore,
    such challenges continue to exist when a synergy is attempted. Data privacy is
    a prominent concern for all three technologies, which cannot be mitigated by combining
    them. Another shared challenge is the large data volumes, which become more cumbersome
    when we have data fused from different sources. This is coupled with the increase
    in processing time and costs. In fact, the fusion of data of different types (sensor
    data and images of different resolutions) creates further challenges to the goal
    of having them efficiently integrated. A further challenge of the complementary
    use of the aformentioned technologies is that farmers need to become acquainted
    with not just one but all the technologies that are being combined. Moreover,
    it should be mentioned that the lack of current research regarding actual synergies
    between the three technologies is both an important impeding factor towards a
    holistic paradigm involving all three and a challenge for future research and
    pilot projects. In fact, in our literature review, out of the 205 reviewed works,
    only 24 papers provided synergy use cases. Finally, the lack of standardization
    poses further challenges with reference to their complementary use. In fact, all
    use cases found by the authors miss any particular standardization procedure,
    which could be beneficial for the future of synergical use between technologies.
    5. Discussion The value of satellite imagery in PA greatly depends on the application
    it is required for, as well as the particularities of the crops and the field.
    Even VHR satellites such as World View-3 are not suitable for individual plant
    analysis. While they provide a 30 cm per pixel spatial resolution on RGB imagery,
    on MS imagery, their spatial resolution is about 1.24 m per pixel. Thus, while
    their RGB imagery resolution is good enough for distinguishing canopies, the same
    satellite MS spatial resolution is not enough to provide adequate data for further
    analysis of these canopies. Evidently, satellite use is limited in heterogeneous
    farms, meaning farms that provide imagery that combines many different textures,
    such as soil, plants, wild weeds, or farming structures. In contrast, satellites
    are more useful for crops that cover an area homogeneously, such as cereal crops.
    But even in these types of plantations, applications such as wild-weed identification
    and soil spectral analysis benefit the most from the highest possible spatial
    resolution. Therefore, UAVs have an edge in applications of this type or heterogeneous
    farms. Very-high-definition images from UAVs, on the other hand, may introduce
    data redundancy, which lowers the performance of the algorithms used to process
    the images [117]. Upscaling may be necessary to a resolution scale, which ensures
    optimal performance of the algorithm used, which is another impediment to the
    UAV standardization of procedures regarding PA. It is therefore necessary to know
    the optimal resolution scale for each use case, as different combinations of algorithms
    and crops require different optimal resolutions. An added benefit is that lower
    resolution requirements allow the UAVs to fly to a higher altitude, thus also
    reducing battery expenditure and the time needed for the image-gathering excursion
    [116]. It is less probable to obtain usable imagery during rainy weather with
    a satellite than it is with a UAV system ([57,74]), as cloud coverage greatly
    affects satellite image quality. It might even render satellite images unusable
    if the coverage is too dense. Diseases can evolve rapidly, requiring precise and
    strict monitoring to ensure results, and skipping a measurement because of cloud
    coverage might throw off the project completely. On the opposite end, UAVs, being
    able to fly at will and being unaffected by cloud coverage, have a much higher
    capability for frequent imaging. A satellite’s lower resolution does come with
    certain benefits. Wide coverage is a satellite’s inherent advantage, and, as there
    is no piloting involved, the homogeneity of data is guaranteed. In contrast, UAVs
    have to be piloted carefully, they have to be stable enough to follow their required
    trajectory, and they have to maintain the same height over crops. Covering the
    same area as a satellite requires more images, more time, an expert pilot, and
    more processing of the images to create the final mosaics. It is therefore evident
    that UAVs are optimal for small to medium farms, where they are not required to
    cover vast areas for image acquisition. Large farms are better served by satellite
    imagery, supposing that they are not very heterogeneous. UAVs, being highly modular
    platforms that come in all shapes and sizes while also being able to carry many
    different sensors, have abundant flexibility but at the cost of standardization.
    Sensor calibration is a process that is dependent on the equipment; therefore,
    each combination of UAV model and sensor requires its own calibration procedure.
    In contrast, satellites do not face such issues, as their calibration is a standardized
    procedure that has been taken care of by the platform operators. Therefore, the
    risk of obtaining unusable data due to calibration faults is higher in UAVs. Moreover,
    due to this lack of standardization, UAV images have a slightly higher processing
    complexity than satellite imagery. Still, by having a much higher temporal resolution
    and by being devices that can become part of a wider IoT network, UAVs can provide
    their data faster for processing and can even utilize edge computing if there
    is available on-field infrastructure. Nevertheless, UAVs require a large upfront
    investment, that includes the cost of buying the vehicle, as well as the cost
    of buying its sensory equipment. Following this considerable investment, the cost
    of using and maintaining the platform includes recharging costs, the cost of man
    hours for processing the images, the cost of man hours for piloting the platform,
    and any costs for repairs and spare parts. Satellites, on the other hand, do not
    require the large upfront investment, but high spatial resolution satellite images
    can only be acquired by paying a hefty price. A further cost is added due to the
    man hours and skills required to process the satellite data. Adding to the challenge
    of buying and setting up a UAV platform for remote sensing are the bureaucratic
    difficulties of acquiring a licence to fly it. In contrast, satellite data require
    almost no bureaucratic hurdle for their acquisition. The third PA technology analysed
    in this review is IoT. This may incorporate any type of sensor, from soil sensors
    that measure soil parameters, such as moisture, temperature, and the concentration
    of elements such as carbon and nitrogen, to sensors that measure water levels
    in crops for irrigation purposes, to MS sensors that measure vegetation indices.
    An IoT device can have any combination of sensors and can be adapted to the particularities
    of the farm under examination. IoT tends to be more expensive than UAVs or satellite
    data, but provides the most noise-free data out of the three technologies. Moreover,
    their capacity to capitalize on edge-computing puts them at the forefront of scientific
    research, as this allows real-time monitoring, which is an important future prospect
    for PA. Out of the three technologies analyzed, IoT is the only technology that
    has the capacity for continuous monitoring. Measurements from ground sensors are
    used as training and evaluation sets for ML algorithms for application in remote
    sensing, because their data are the most trustworthy source of measurement regarding
    soil moisture, concentrations of various elements in the soil, water plant status,
    and similar quantities that can be measured through physical contact or proximal
    sensing. The calculation of vegetation indices through ground remote sensors,
    on the other hand, is a more challenging endeavor. Ground remote sensing requires
    many sensors to be placed strategically across the field for maximum coverage,
    and even then, only homogeneous crop types can be measured safely. Image recognition
    of canopies or rows of vines in heterogeneous environments is very difficult or
    even impossible to achieve when using ground remote sensors because of the angle
    the images are taken from. IoT systems are susceptible to attacks by malicious
    third parties, as they always require a network infrastructure to operate. On
    the other hand, UAVs usually operate without becoming a part of a network. Thus,
    they are less susceptible to hacking. Satellites, as they are not operated by
    the farmer, cannot become victims of hacking attacks. Nevertheless, satellite
    data from a farmer’s field can still be used for nefarious purposes, similar to
    data extracted from IoT and UAVs. Satellites and UAVs are reusable assets, in
    contrast to cheap ground sensors. The environmental waste from an IoT system can
    be an important cause for concern. In particular, as the dimensions of the under-measurement
    field become larger, so does the number of sensors required to cover it. It can
    be safely assumed that, cost-wise and environmentally, IoT for large fields is
    not an optimal choice. Complementary use relies on capitalizing on the strengths
    of one technology while complementing its weaknesses with another technology.
    UAVs can be used to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite MS data on certain
    parts of a field in order to examine that part more carefully. UAVs are also sources
    of excellent training data for ML algorithms that will then be applied to satellite
    imagery. Similarly, IoT systems are great producers of training data, especially
    for the purposes of irrigation and the measurement of soil parameters. LiDAR and
    thermal sensors on the ground can be used to enhance remotely sensed imagery.
    UAVs and IoT can therefore provide precision when satellite information is not
    precise enough for the needed application. IoT and UAVs can act in synergy in
    a multitude of ways. The UAV can provide its remotely sensed data to complement
    data gathered by the ground nodes. A UAV can itself become another node in an
    IoT system so that its information can be processed in tandem with the information
    of the other nodes. UAVs can even help mitigate power expenditure in an IoT system,
    which is an important limitation, by serving as a carrier of data from sensors
    to the main station. 6. Conclusions This systematic review summarized the limitations
    of ground-based, space-borne, and airborne technologies for PA, as they are presented
    in recent literature. It also pinpointed and summarized works that provide useful
    synergies between these technologies. These studies, when paralleled with the
    limitations of each technology, enable certain conclusions to be drawn, which
    can be summed up in the following points: Satellite is the broadest of the three
    technologies, providing ample farm coverage and good image detail. Cost-wise,
    it is the least risky source of PA data out of the three technologies, but it
    is also the slowest to provide usable results. UAVs have great flexibility and
    the capability to provide very specific information, but they are costly when
    applied to large farms, while also requiring a risky upfront investment from farmers.
    Their ability to analyze crops in very fine detail allows them to deal with specialized
    problems such as diseases or wild weeds. Still, using them is far from a standardized
    procedure, and more research is needed to establish the UAVs as a definitive solution.
    IoT provides the most specific information, as it can be tailored to the particular
    crop and farm. Moreover, it takes the smallest amount of time for data processing
    and has the unique potential of constant field monitoring. Its high specialization
    comes at the cost of reduced flexibility and area coverage. The review process
    included reviewing 24 use cases of synergies in the domain of agriculture between
    the technologies in question. Open challenges setting the ground for future research
    include data privacy issues, large data volumes, data fusion, farmers’ acquaintance
    with the technology, and lack of standardization. Taking steps toward addressing
    such challenges could facilitate further synergies and help the agricultural domain
    advance toward the Agriculture 4.0 paradigm. As things stand, complementary use
    of the three technologies requires further research. The number of works that
    make an effort to combine them is far too small when compared with the number

  description: Several variables, including a rising human population, varying weather
    patterns in the context of ongoing climate change, and the rapid worldwide spread
    of epidemics, all contribute to boosting agricultural demand. To assure food availability,
    quality, and safety while increasing yields and profitability, precision agriculture
    must progress swiftly. Precision viticulture aims to optimize vineyard management
    in this setting by reducing resource consumption and environmental impact while
    simultaneously enhancing the yield, product quality, and oenological potential
    of vineyards. This comprehensive review article offers an overview of the real-world
    and laboratory applications of optical and non-optical sensors in precision viticulture
    for 3D modelling. Hence, there is a pressing need to track the development of
    crops at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, in a wide variety of environments,
    and for a wide range of objectives in a non-destructive manner. Due to the intrinsic
    spatial heterogeneity of vineyards, the adoption of precision viticulture necessitates
    crop monitoring using contactless and non-invasive sensors such as ultrasonic,
    LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), depth, or RGB cameras to prevent low accuracy
    and sparse sampling. This study aims to assist researchers in gaining a broad
    understanding of the sensing technologies for precision viticulture, the present
    problems, and the advancement of the state of the art. The study focuses on sensors
    used for Proximal Sensing to geometrically characterize vines using statically
    or dynamically ground-based measurements through a wide range of mobile sensing
    platforms. The employed sensors, data extraction, and analysis procedures are
    described. Moreover, the present and future potential of Proximal Sensing and
    Remote Sensing in vineyards is discussed.

    • Ground-based sensors aid Precision Viticulture to manage vineyards site-specifically.
    • A thorough review was conducted to present the latest ground-based sensor advances.
    • Non-optical and optical sensors are presented to characterize vine 2D and 3D
    traits. • Canopy characterization and vineyard yield forecasting are the most

    the real-world and laboratory applications of optical and non-optical sensors
    in precision viticulture for 3D modelling. Hence, there is a pressing need to
    track the development of crops at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales,
    in a wide variety of environments, and for a wide range of objectives in a non-destructive
    manner. Due to the intrinsic spatial heterogeneity of vineyards, the adoption
    of precision viticulture necessitates crop monitoring using contactless and non-invasive
    sensors such as ultrasonic, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), depth, or RGB
    cameras to prevent low accuracy and sparse sampling. This study aims to assist
    researchers in gaining a broad understanding of the sensing technologies for precision
    viticulture, the present problems, and the advancement of the state of the art.
    The study focuses on sensors used for Proximal Sensing to geometrically characterize
    vines using statically or dynamically ground-based measurements through a wide
    range of mobile sensing platforms. The employed sensors, data extraction, and
    analysis procedures are described. Moreover, the present and future potential
    of Proximal Sensing and Remote Sensing in vineyards is discussed. Previous article
    in issue Next article in issue 1. Introduction Increased demands on agricultural
    output may be traced back to several factors; an ever-growing global population,
    shifting weather patterns (Gitz et al., 2016), the global COVID-19 (Laborde et
    al., 2020) and likely future epidemics. In order to meet the needs of the current
    and future agricultural market, precision agriculture must advance rapidly to
    ensure food availability, quality, and security while maximizing yields and profits.
    In this context, precision viticulture strives to optimize vineyard management
    by minimizing resource consumption and environmental impact while increasing the
    yield, product quality, and oenological potential of vineyards (Matese and Di
    Gennaro, 2015). Vine-growing fields in Europe account for 44 % of the world''s
    vine-growing area and 57 % of wine production volume (Carvalho et al., 2021).
    The implementation of precision agriculture began in the 1990s, although the implementation
    in viticulture started substantially later than in other crops. Research and commercial
    applications in precision viticulture made the first steps in the 2000s decade
    (Santesteban, 2019). The geometric characterization of vines has traditionally
    relied upon, and still, nowadays, manual measurements that are prone to inaccuracy,
    incur substantial labour and are time-consuming (Escolà et al., 2017). In addition,
    specific manual measurements such as canopy height and thickness, width, height,
    distribution of leaf sizes, or leaf area must be done by experienced operators
    (Cheraïet et al., 2020, Petrović et al., 2022). Nevertheless, experts can sample
    just small sections of large vineyard plots and extrapolate the results to the
    entire field, resulting in errors and inaccuracies (Zabawa et al., 2020). However,
    as highly accurate measurements due to precision viticulture techniques became
    more feasible along with more automated data processing, the foundation of traditional
    and manual measurements will begin to be questioned, hence outdated. Although
    in some instances, some measuring principles, rather than using measuring tapes
    or rods, high accuracy close-up triangulation laser scanners have been used as
    reference measurements. For example, Rose et al. (2016) 3D reconstructed artificial
    grape bunches with a point-to-point resolution of 14 µm and an accuracy of 45
    µm as highly accurate reference data. Thus, the adoption of precision viticulture
    implies crop monitoring using contactless and non-invasive sensors. These can
    be ultrasonic, LiDAR, RGB-Depth (from depth sensors featuring RGB sensors), or
    RGB sensors to avoid low accuracy and sparse sampling due to the inherent spatial
    variability of vineyards. For example, thanks to the implementation of sensors
    in a vineyard, accurate data-driven decisions can be taken since yield can be
    monitored to forecast yearly profitability, calculate losses under extreme weather
    conditions, and plan the logistics for the harvest (Henry et al., 2022). Therefore,
    non-destructive analyses of vine geometric traits according to different objectives
    such as yield forecasting (del-Campo-Sanchez A., Moreno M., Ballesteros R., Hernandez-Lopez
    D. , 2019, Tagarakis et al., 2018), plant breeding improvements (Schöler and Steinhage,
    2015), and fertilizer (Andújar et al., 2019) and pesticide (Palleja and Landers,
    2017) management are now more feasible due to current state-of-the-art sensor
    technologies. Interestingly, over the past few decades, most vineyards have been
    converted to wall crops due to their agronomic benefits, i.e., trellis or hedgerow
    shapes (Planas et al., 2022). These form a suitable architecture and a spatial
    vineyard arrangement for sensing technologies to geometrically characterize vines,
    in contrast to traditional “gobelet” vine training. Furthermore, key factors such
    as steadily increasing computational processing capacity and resolution, miniaturization
    of the associated hardware, and cost reduction enable new emerging sensors to
    cope better with complex agricultural tasks. Also, ongoing mechatronic advances
    have helped semi-, or fully automatic mobile terrestrial platforms acquire architectural
    and spectral data. To date, despite decades of research, the transfer of these
    to everyday agriculture, i.e., commercial applications, is almost non-existent.
    This review aims to outline the available systems with their possible applications
    to outline which system fits each case study according to their particular conditions.
    Therefore, creating a summary of all technologies and their applicability. Furthermore,
    the present state-of-the-art review of the latest advances in precision viticulture
    employing proximal sensing technologies can help to identify the most appropriate
    technologies for specific crop purposes. The review identifies gaps in current
    research, which can inform future studies. On the other hand, it provides a clear
    overview of the state-of-the-art in the field, which can aid in developing new
    technologies and applications. Hence, to identify potential applications of proximal
    sensing technologies in precision viticulture, which can improve crop yields and
    reduce costs. In light of the mentioned framework, this review article aims to
    provide a comprehensive overview of the application of optical and non-optical
    sensors in precision viticulture in real fields and laboratory conditions. This
    paper focuses on proximal sensing through ground-based measurements either statically
    (i.e., tripods) or on-the-go (i.e., employing a variety of mobile platforms) for
    the geometrical characterization of vines. On the other hand, ground-based sensors,
    compared to remote sensing, generally allow higher resolution and accuracy. Moreover,
    an important time-saver is the ability to quickly and easily connect sensors,
    for instance, on the tractor, and move them to other locations in the vineyard
    as needed. Sensor selection is challenging due to the complex nature of unstructured
    environments, particularly in vineyards. In order to achieve each site-specific
    agronomic objective, it is often necessary to combine a variety of sensors and
    techniques. Even though no sensor meets all criteria, a multitude of applications
    ranging from phenotyping purposes (Mack et al., 2017) to assessing canopy structure
    for plant protection products (Cheraiet et al., 2021) using the capabilities of
    LiDAR systems in vineyards have been proposed. LiDAR sensors use a laser beam
    with a relatively small footprint. In contrast, ultrasonic sensors were adopted
    as early as the late 80s in orchards (Giles et al., 1987) due to their low-cost
    and user-friendliness. Hence, this approach was later transferred to vineyard
    applications to extract 2D parameters such as canopy width and height to modify
    spray flow rate (Gil et al., 2007, Llorens et al., 2010). However, they provide
    a larger cross-section (Berk et al., 2016), i.e., usually featuring a 5° angle
    that turns into decimetres at less than 2 m, hence performing a limited penetration
    capability (Llorens et al., 2011a). Depth cameras implemented in fields such as
    quality control (Frangez et al., 2021), obstacle avoidance (Schmidt and Wang,
    2014), or robotic applications (Lam et al., 2022) have also been transferred to
    precision viticulture. Hence, in recent years, the introduction of depth cameras,
    most of them in conjunction with RGB sensors, has accelerated the growth of 3D
    modelling (Bengochea-Guevara et al., 2018). Notably, due to their relatively low
    price and widespread use in the gaming industry, the Kinect camera series manufactured
    by Microsoft (Pagliari and Pinto, 2015). Their applications range from canopy
    and trunk structure (Andújar et al., 2019), wood volume (Moreno et al., 2022)
    to bunch volume (Hacking et al., 2019) assessment. Depth cameras have been explored
    indoors and outdoors, achieving the best results as in the case of bunch volume
    estimation (Hacking et al., 2019) and bunch phenotyping (Rist et al., 2019) when
    tested in the laboratory. Since working under sunlight represent one of the most
    significant constraints when using these optical sensors (Neupane et al., 2021),
    laboratory lighting conditions can be controlled (Hacking et al., 2019) to avoid
    sparse or incomplete point clouds (Rist et al., 2019). Finally, fast advances
    in the power computational capacity and the widespread use of consumer digital
    cameras over the last decade have contributed to precision viticulture. Hence,
    RGB sensors through digital photogrammetry have been researched mainly for phenotyping
    purposes (Kicherer et al., 2017a) and vineyard yield estimation (Herrero-Huerta
    et al., 2015). Moreover, the advent of machine learning and high-performance computing
    (Huerta et al., 2020) has fueled current and prospective applications in object
    recognition, i.e., such as bunch diameter and morphology or modelling and counting
    berries (Yin et al., 2021). 2. Use of ultrasonic distance sensors for canopy characterization
    Ultrasonic sensors have been widely used for many agricultural purposes since
    they are robust (Escolà et al., 2011), inexpensive (Palleja and Landers, 2017),
    and easy to operate (Andújar et al., 2012) in real-time applications (Gil et al.,
    2007, Rosell and Sanz, 2012). This type of ranging sensor, also known as a distance
    sensor, is designed to measure the distance to the nearest object by emitting
    high-frequency waves in a specific direction. The distance to an object is determined
    by measuring the time interval between wave emission and reception, i.e., time-of-flight
    principle. Therefore, the reception of an ultrasound signal, i.e., echo wave,
    suggests an object has interrupted the transmission of the ultrasound pulse (Palleja
    and Landers, 2015). The resolution of the time measurement determines the range
    resolution, thus the shortest distance that can be measured. Crop key architectural
    parameters such as canopy structure (height, width or volume) or leaf area are
    related to plant growth, health status, or potential yield. Thus, growers can
    identify and manage areas according to their different characteristics. Ultrasonic
    sensors can provide a spatial resolution, a sampling length of 1 m, and a working
    width of 1.5 m (Llorens et al., 2010) sufficient to use variable rate applications.
    Then it is feasible to adjust pesticides or fertilizer dose rates according to
    the tree volume variability, i.e., considering the area of transversal sections
    of the vine rows (Colaço et al., 2018, Schumann and Zaman, 2005). Before LiDAR
    systems became accessible and affordable, the inexpensive ultrasonic sensors (Lan,
    2009) were utilized, being sufficiently robust for agricultural use (Jeon et al.,
    2011, Scotford and Miller, 2004), though without gaining wide acceptance (Cheraïet
    et al., 2020). However, accurate ultrasonic sensor readings are not immune to
    highly dusty environments. Dust particles in the air can scatter the ultrasonic
    waves (Song et al., 2021), causing them to be reflected in multiple directions
    and reducing the strength of the reflected signal, i.e., resulting in inaccurate
    measurements. In contrast, ultrasonic sensors are not affected by excessive ambient
    light as in the case of optical time-of-flight sensors (Komarizadehasl et al.,
    2022). On the other hand, compared to LiDAR systems, the resolution and accuracy
    of ultrasonic readings are limited by a larger angle of divergence of ultrasound
    waves. Thus, resulting in a wider field of view as the distance between the sensor
    and the target increases. Hence, when locating the sensor with respect to the
    crop, a significant drawback is having to install many sensors to adequately cover
    the vines (Llorens et al., 2011a, Rosell and Sanz, 2012). Ultrasonic sensors are
    regarded as optimal for detecting average canopy characteristics, whereas LiDAR
    systems are better for collecting faster and more precise canopy information (Gu
    et al., 2021), particularly in challenging partially defoliated canopies (Tumbo
    et al., 2002). Other drawbacks are related to low sampling speed or interferences
    produced by using sensors in close proximity (Narvaez et al., 2017). However,
    despite these technical downsides, the low price and robustness could have explained
    that examples are manifold in crop geometric characterization. It is worth noting
    that canopy characterization may vary from the most basic measurements of the
    principal structural characteristics (such as canopy height and width) to the
    most complex ones (such as leaf area density, porosity, and leaf area index) (Gil
    et al., 2019). Therefore, to control the optimal application of inputs, accurate
    measurement of canopy attributes such as height, volume, or foliage density is
    essential (Zhou et al., 2021). During spraying, the sprayer modulates the dose
    in real time, necessitating that the sensor system delivers accurate and timely
    canopy data (Wandkar et al., 2018). Moreover, the ability to detect gaps between
    crop plants is crucial to saving spray, hence reducing drift. One of the earliest
    use of ultrasonic sensors (Giles et al., 1987) analyzed the functioning of a prototype
    in peach and apple trees. Five ultrasonic sensors attached at different heights
    enable 3-nozzle manifolds to be turned on and off. Savings of up to 52% were reported.
    However, spray deposition from the controlled sprayer was observed to be reduced
    in some locations. Nonetheless, the proposed system needed further improvements
    to deal with deposition deficiencies in the upper regions of the trees and optimize
    sprayer configurations. Recent years have been dedicated to enhancing the design
    of pesticide spraying equipment. Even though numerous advancements have been centred
    upon sensor-based precision spraying to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize
    the risk of off-target pesticide losses, there is still a significant gap between
    these innovative high-end crop protection solutions and standard European agricultural
    practices. For example, the use of low-technology level sprayers or the lack of
    proper operator training to achieve an efficient spray application (Grella et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, ultrasonic solutions proposed back in 1987 (Giles et
    al., 1987) or later in vineyard field experiments in 2005 (Gil et al., 2007) have
    not been implemented yet in commercial agriculture despite being low-cost and
    effective. Moreover, precision viticulture research is often focused on laboratory
    or experimental plot studies rather than on-farm trials. Hence research results
    may not be directly applicable to commercial-scale operations. Additionally, precision
    viticulture technologies can be expensive and complex, making it difficult for
    farmers to implement them on their own. Furthermore, as aforementioned, many farmers
    may lack the technical expertise needed to use precision viticulture technologies
    effectively, also the lack of standardization of the data used makes it difficult
    to compare and validate results from different studies. In vineyards, ultrasonic
    sensors have garnered considerable interest among researchers to characterize
    vine crop geometry for the aforementioned purposes, being tractors the most selected
    mobile platform. In contrast, for example, in LiDAR applications, aside from tractors,
    ground agricultural utility vehicles, electric microcars and all-terrain vehicles
    have been employed. Most ultrasonic sensor trials have been conducted in cultivars
    such as ‘Cabernet sauvignon,’ ‘Merlot,’ ‘Tempranillo’ and ‘Pinot Grigio.’ Gil
    et al. (2007) assessed an alternative approach that applies an effective volume
    rate based on the crop structure in terms of l·m−3, i.e., tree row volume (TRV),
    in opposition to the conventional method that is based on the amount of product
    per unit of the ground surface (300 L·ha−1). A multi-nozzle air-blast sprayer
    was installed with three ultrasonic sensors and three electro-valves to adjust
    the nozzle flow rate in real time based on the varying crop width. An average
    of 58% chemical savings was reported as an achievable adjustment to variations
    of vine architecture for spray decisions compared to conventional uniform application.
    Later on, in closely akin research to (Gil et al., 2007), Llorens et al. (2010)
    obtained a mean savings of 58% in pesticide consumption by implementing ultrasonic
    detection technology in vines varieties (cv. ‘Merlot,’ cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’
    and cv. ‘Tempranillo’) while achieving similar leaf spray deposition compared
    to traditional methods. Utilizing ultrasonic sensors in conjunction with variable
    rate electro valves and the related software for automation made it feasible to
    adjust the spray flow rate in real time based on the canopy volume. This allows
    for a significant reduction in spray volume while maintaining or even improving
    coverage and penetration rates compared to conventional approaches. Nevertheless,
    these experiments were constrained by the use of ultrasonic transducers that worked
    independently and not as arrays, having a relatively wide beam width, i.e., lower
    resolution compared to LiDAR systems (Parr et al., 2021). A wider field of view
    might result in overpredicting vine canopy volume to detect non-target vegetation
    that extends outward from the crop as tall grass, as found in (Tumbo et al., 2002)
    when assessing citrus trees. After three years of field tests (2008, 2009, and
    2010), in (Llorens et al., 2011a), ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors were compared
    to study the detection accuracy of canopy characteristics focusing on leaf area
    and leaf wall area. Ground truth crop height, width, and leaf area index were
    measured according to (Manktelow and Praat, 1997) implemented in apple trees.
    It was concluded that the LiDAR sensor provides more accurate and comprehensive
    information about the canopy''s essential properties than the ultrasonic sensor,
    LAI (R2 = 0.51), but at the expense of a more complex data postprocessing analysis.
    In contrast, the user-friendliness, robustness, and simplicity of ultrasonic sensors
    may compensate for their lower spatial resolution. Similarly, Palleja and Landers
    (2015) proposed a real-time system to detect the gap between vines and to estimate
    canopy density, through the growing season, as a function of ultrasound wave intensity.
    The system estimated similar values on both sides of the row. However, an error
    of 14.1% for vineyards and 3.8% for apple trees was found. This discrepancy could
    be related to differences in canopy structure or the shade of the trees near the
    vineyard. The system was even sufficiently sensitive to detect the effects of
    hailstorm on the canopy. However, ultrasonic information was not compared to ground-truth
    values. Later on, Palleja and Landers (2017) went a step forward in developing
    a low-cost system to compare ultrasonic data with a proven, accepted method to
    estimate canopy density, i.e., point quadrat analysis. According to the results,
    the system had to be calibrated for each plant or variety. In addition, the ultrasound
    system determined density with an error of 4.76 per cent throughout the first
    period, mid-season, and before harvesting. However, it has to be calibrated. Also,
    the system in a very uneven field generated inconsistent data. Point quadrat measurements
    were also assessed in (Vitali et al., 2013), along with optical measurements of
    LAI to be compared with ultrasonic data. The correlation between ultrasonic elaborations,
    point quadrat, and direct leaf area measurement ranged between 0.80 and 0.85 for
    R2. Low resolution, hence poorer directionality of ultrasonic than LiDAR sensors,
    hinders ultrasonic waves from penetrating through the canopy to detect inner leaves
    or grape bunches. This results in the inability to sense vegetative plant structures
    occluded by the nearest leaf. This limitation can be addressed by removing leaves
    obstructing the path of the waves, although this is time-consuming and tedious.
    Another possible solution can be implemented by using a synthetic-aperture-radar
    system operating between 2 and 6 GHz that uses microwaves to detect bunches when
    obscured by leaves (Eccleston et al., 2018). Nevertheless, these sensors are costly
    and not close to commercialization. Despite these limitations, in lab conditions,
    Parr et al. (2021) used a novel array of ultrasonic transducers developed by (Legg
    and Bradley, 2019, Legg and Bradley, 2020) to analyze vine canopies, locating
    grape clusters behind leaves. This highly directional low-frequency ultrasonic
    array composed of ultrasonic air-coupled transducers and microphones produces
    a narrower beam-width compared to a single ultrasonic transducer. Hence, the ultrasonic
    array can sense through multiple depths behind the front leaves, providing data
    from the inner bunch of grapes. Although the array allowed separating the echoes
    from grapes and leaves, the ultrasonic waves appeared to be identical. To address
    this issue, the proposed system discriminated the echoes from grapes and leaves
    by lightly agitating them with a fan. In this manner, multiple measurements were
    obtained to be filtered by using averaging and variance. Given the promising results,
    the authors reported the need to undertake future field trials to gain a deeper
    insight into this system in a real vineyard. Interestingly, some authors have
    proposed the combination of NDVI and ultrasonic sensors to estimate growth and
    biomass vigour. Examples are found in cotton (Sui and A. Thomasson, 2006), wheat
    (Scotford and Miller, 2004), and spinach (Jones et al., 2007). In particular,
    Mazzetto et al. (2010) developed a mobile lab based on ultrasonic sensors mounted
    at several heights to measure canopy thickness along with NDVI sensors. Canopy
    health and vigour status over the growing process of vines were assessed. The
    repeatability of NDVI values and ultrasonic data was strong (Pearson’s coefficients
    0.88 and 0.85, respectively). NDVI values and ultrasonic sensor readings were
    integrated to assess vine pathological detection i.e., to map disease incidence.
    In summary, ultrasonic sensors despite the latest advances in new sensing devices,
    particularly in terms of optical sensors, these are still less expensive and user-friendly,
    offering robustness in the ever-harsh conditions when working under real field
    conditions. Table 1 shows studies employing ultrasonic sensors, most of them related
    to provide an effective solution to modify spray flow rate according to canopy
    key geometric parameters. Table 1. Ultrasonic sensors applied both in vineyards

    b First experiment was undertaken in a greenhouse to determine the signal behaviour
    in a controlled environment. 3. Radar 3-D imagery technique to estimate vine grape
    yield The estimated yield is commonly determined before the harvest through optical
    systems to detect grapes. Then, the yield is monitored to determine expected yearly
    profits, forecast losses during unfavourable weather, plan for the harvest and
    control the yield per vine. However, detecting hidden grapes occluded by woody
    parts or leaves is challenging for optical sensors. Often, leaf removal is needed
    before taking optical measurements, though this approach is time-consuming and
    destructive. Another approach to detecting hidden bunches can be based on calculating
    the elapsed time from emission to reception of Radar (radio detection and ranging)
    waves instead of sound waves. The latter are mechanical waves that depend on an
    elastic medium to spread over (Pingret et al., 2012). In precision agriculture
    applications, typically through the air. In contrast, radar waves are electromagnetic
    waves able to travel in a vacuum, hence being able to operate in foggy, dusty,
    snowy, and poorly lighted settings. Microwave radars can measure the geometric
    and dielectric properties of the target object, penetrating more deeply vegetation
    than light waves (Sivasankar et al., 2018), hence detecting berries occluded totally
    or partially by leaves, shoots or other grapes (Henry et al., 2022, Henry et al.,
    2019). Elect electromagnetically reflected centimetre-size objects can be detected
    using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FM-CW) microwave radars (Boris et al.,
    2014) operating at micro- and millimetre-wave frequencies. Hence, Henry et al.
    (2019) obtained 3D radar images of grape clusters of five cultivars (‘Mourvèdre,’
    ‘Gamay,’ ‘Merlot,’ ‘Grenache,’ and ‘Alicante-Bouschet’) during the harvesting
    season. Three commercial radars were employed at 24, 77, and 122 GHz allowing
    the radar beam scanning to generate 3-D images from which the mass of vine grape
    was derived. Due to the dielectric properties of water found in the different
    structures of the vine, when placed the leaves and grapes in the presence of an
    electric field, their atoms and molecules are polarized. Hence, dielectric permittivity
    indicates a material ability to resist an applied electric field (Mayoral et al.,
    2019). Water is the main component of grapes, and since the real relative permittivity
    is high, the electromagnetic reflectivity of grapes at the three chosen frequencies
    can be exploited conveniently for grape detection. Therefore, the computation
    of appropriate statistical estimators derived from measured polarization and magnitude
    or radar echoes yield estimation can be performed by 3D imaging the grape bunches.
    Thus, as an electromagnetic field is employed, the lighting of the setting and
    the colour of the grape clusters do not affect the accuracy of the grape yield
    estimate. At 122 GHz, accurate estimations within 1% were obtained for three varieties
    of vine plants. With a mass estimation error of 7.3% for five varieties, the 77-GHz
    yield estimate is also encouraging. However, it is worth noting that in the scene,
    other natural (trunks, leaves, or shoots) or man-made (irrigation hose, vine training,
    or metallic stakes) electronic reflectors can be present and mask the vine grape
    echoes. In contrast, calibration is not needed as in optical sensors due to variable
    luminosity. Later, Henry et al. (2022) also found yield estimation errors lower
    than 10% using a 122 GHz FM-CW radar mounted on a moving platform instead of a
    stationary approach. In contrast to their previous study, different phenological
    states were assessed in different weather conditions. In this study, the derived
    data suffered from displacements and vibrations at the cost of enlarging the sampling
    scale, i.e., more sampled vines. In any case, similar to echo interferences in
    ultrasonic sensors, radar sensors suffer from other natural or artificial electromagnetic
    reflectors, for example, trunks, leaves, shoots, or anchoring and irrigation systems,
    that can be present in the scene and ultimately mask the target, i.e., grapevine
    echoes (Henry et al., 2019). In addition, Radar data is substantially more difficult
    to interpret than those from optical sensors such as cameras or LiDAR sensors
    (Steinbaeck et al., 2017). 4. 2D and 3D modelling by LiDAR system on vineyard
    applications LiDAR, as an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging, is sometimes
    referenced as a laser scanner. According to the distance measurement technique,
    there are two types of LiDAR systems: (i) Time of Flight (ToF) LiDAR, which monitors
    the time the laser pulse takes, i.e., flight time, from its emission to the detection
    of a reflected portion of the radiation from the target, and (ii) Phase-Shift
    LiDAR, which employs the phase difference between the incident and reflected laser
    beam (Méndez et al., 2013). The ToF LiDAR is the most common in agriculture applications.
    Usually, the infrared wavelength is the laser beam mode employed in sensing plant
    geometry (Gregorio and Llorens, 2021). LiDAR offers several benefits when being
    used in field environments due to its high spatial resolution, repeatability,
    less sensitivity to changes in illumination conditions, i.e., robustness against
    sunlight (Jin et al., 2021, Nehme et al., 2021, Vázquez-Arellano et al., 2016),
    air temperature and wind (Madec et al., 2017) as well as its applicability (Lowe
    et al., 2021). However, dense canopies may cause a “shadow effect” that reduces
    the input data since the laser beams cannot penetrate the surface to obtain measurements
    from inner structures (Berk et al., 2016). Moreover, when the laser beam hits
    multiple objects due to its size, i.e., increasing beam divergence, the “mixed
    pixels” phenomenon may occur because of the edge effect that affects the distance
    measurement (Karp et al., 2017, Sanz-Cortiella et al., 2011b). Unlike ultrasonic
    sensors, despite these allowing variable rate spraying, i.e., modulated to canopy
    architecture, LiDAR sensors offer advantages due to a wider field of view, lower
    divergence of the light beam (Andújar et al., 2013), higher spatial resolution,
    and measuring speed, gathering more data in each scan (Méndez et al., 2013). Furthermore,
    a 2D LiDAR scanner can monitor distances in multiple directions within a single
    plane, resulting in a significantly more accurate target profile (Colaço et al.,
    2018). Two types of laser scanners can be differentiated within the LiDAR sensors:
    3D (Chakraborty et al., 2019) and 2D. However, there is widespread use of 2D laser
    scanners in agriculture since they are less expensive (Escolà et al., 2016, Moreno
    et al., 2020b, Palacin et al., 2007, Rosell et al., 2009a) and can be utilized
    to acquire 3D data. 2D LiDAR registers a point cloud that belongs to a section
    or segment of the target object. Hence, knowing the sensor spatial position is
    fundamental to reconstructing a 3D point cloud. The integration of high-accuracy
    RTK-GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning systems meant a significant
    improvement and widespread use in data collecting and processing, georeferencing
    agricultural key parameters (Del-Moral-Martínez et al., 2015, Ehsani et al., 2004,
    Nørremark et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2010). LiDAR first studies in viticulture
    were aimed at analysing the light interception of organs of vines regarding different
    training systems (Poni et al., 1996). In addition, characterising canopy structure
    and light microclimate confirm that shoot orientation is the primary variable
    for grape cluster exposure (Mabrouk and Sinoquet, 1998). This constituted a substantial
    achievement in the indirect, rapid, reproducible, and non-destructive estimate
    of crucial vine traits. Later, terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) have been widely
    used to characterize vine geometry and structure. TLS can be used statically (Keightley
    and Bawden, 2010) or integrated into a variety of ground-based vehicles, i.e.,
    mobile terrestrial laser scanners (MTLS), the most common option. MTLS can be
    bicycle-shaped moving platforms, modified vehicles, electric or all-terrain vehicles,
    to either scan directly in 3D or indirectly. The third dimension using 2D LiDAR
    can be obtained through different approaches, i.e., constant known-speed linear
    movement (Rosell et al., 2009a), fixed known reference marks (Sanz et al., 2018)
    or combining GNSS-IMU systems (Del-Moral-Martínez et al., 2015). Although there
    are errors involved in the scans recorded by MTLS, either from intrinsic LiDAR
    functioning, displacements, or GNSS signals, the performance of MTLS is satisfactory
    for geometric characterization. However, using an IMU is advisable to rectify
    LiDAR movements and rotations (pitch, yaw, and roll) (Karp et al., 2017). 4.1.
    3D LiDAR static-based systems in bunch modelling According to the scanning process,
    static-based LiDAR, i.e., mounted on a tripod, typically records higher-density
    scans more accurately than MTLS (Gajardo et al., 2020). However, static-based
    systems have been primarily restricted indoors since covering large areas in a
    vineyard depends on increasing the number of base stations. Hence, several studies
    have been conducted in laboratory conditions introducing new approaches using
    3D data for automated phenotyping. Manual phenotyping measurements constitute
    a phenotyping bottleneck since its analysis is tedious, costly, and time-consuming
    (Furbank and Tester, 2011, Mack et al., 2017). Therefore research in this subject
    has centred on developing automated, multifunctional, and high-throughput phenotyping
    technologies to progress in the breeding field (Forero et al., 2022). Hence, one
    of the essential aspects of phenotyping research is measuring a plant three-dimensional
    morphology (Li et al., 2020). In this regard, Paulus et al. (2013) used a high
    3-D resolution laser scanner attached to an articulated measuring arm to classify
    3D point clouds as leaf or stem organs of grapevine plants (cv. ‘Mueller Thurgau’).
    The equipment was placed on an articulated measuring arm (Romer Infinite 2.0 (2.8
    m Version), Hexagon Metrology Services Ltd., London, UK) to automatically fuse
    single scan lines originating from diverse perspectives. Stems and leaves of grapevines
    were classified with up to 98% accuracy. Likewise, Schöler and Steinhage (2015)
    performed grape bunch 3D architectonic modelling of cv. ‘Riesling’ using the same
    equipment, even in severe occlusions. Berries from the resulting dense point cloud
    were segmented using sphere detection based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)
    algorithm. The rachis location and secondary branch positions were then estimated
    using an approximative geometric technique, followed by a series of optimization
    processes. Their system accurately predicted the quantity and location of components
    (averaged positioning error of 3 mm for branch-twig nodes and less than 1 mm for
    rachis nodes, pedicel origins, and berries). In their research, however, the prediction
    of invisible berries was disregarded. Moreover, since this 3D reconstruction is
    time-consuming, it is unsuitable for real vineyard applications (Buayai et al.,
    2021). Mack et al. (2017) also in cv. ‘Riesling’ generated 3D point clouds using
    the same active laser triangulation method to propose a fully-automated 3D reconstruction
    of stems and grape bunches. Using a 3D sphere model approach through combining
    supervised learning and object recognition methods. Employing a RANSAC algorithm
    to fit a 3D sphere model in berries, their reconstruction achieved 98% precision
    and 94% recall; excellent results despite the fact that a gold standard was manually
    created by placing and labelling spheres i.e., berries at the right positions
    in the point cloud. Other cultivars could be successfully approximated as ellipsoid
    berries; however, this would require high computation times to address the fitting
    parameters (Mack et al., 2018). Similarly, Tello et al. (2016) reconstructed grape
    clusters of eight different grapevine cultivars (‘Aramon,’ ‘Bobal,’ ‘Cabernet
    Franc,’ ‘Danugue,’ ‘Derechero de Muniesa,’ ‘Monastrell,’ ‘Moravia Agria’ and ‘Ruby
    Seedless). Clusters were hung from the peduncle to compare 2D imaging technology,
    i.e., RGB images, with a direct 3D laser scanning system. The direct 3D scanning
    using a portable UNIscanTM scanner (Creaform, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany)
    to estimate the morphological volume of the cluster compared to the 2D approach
    was faulty. A high correlation (R2 = 0.96) with the ground truth was observed,
    i.e., the water displacement method and the 2D image processing. Similarly, using
    a 3D high-resolution laser scanner yet to assess biomass by measuring vine wood
    volume, Keightley and Bawden (2010) proposed a 3D volumetric modelling in laboratory
    conditions. A 3D LiDAR was installed on a tripod for 3D modelling of vines by
    mounting them on a turntable, allowing multiple view angles without repositioning
    the TLS device. A high linear relationship between vine volume and persistent
    biomass, i.e., trunk, branches and root system, was obtained (average Pearson''s
    product moment correlation coefficient of 0.93). Although high-resolution sensors
    have been investigated for bunch modelling, more research is needed to explore
    other development stages and the approximation of grapes with geometric primitives
    such as spheres or ellipsoids. However, the greater the computational complexity,
    the more complex the design and execution of the plant modelling and reconstruction;
    thus, a balance between them must be kept. 4.2. From 2D to direct 3D mobile terrestrial
    laser scanning Unlike static scanning, which allows limited throughput of the
    field block, mobile terrestrial laser scanners (MTLS) are usually the most common
    approach for scanning large areas in a fast and reliable manner based on 2D or
    3D LiDAR. In the case of using 2D LiDAR, primarily, the third dimension is achieved
    by moving the sensor perpendicular to the scanning plane, i.e., the vine rows
    (see Table 2, measuring approach). Then, adding subsequent 2D scanned transects
    and generating dense 3D point clouds. LiDAR static scanning can be more accurate
    than MTLS approaches (Gajardo et al., 2020, Lin et al., 2010). However, when covering
    large areas statically, i.e., mounted on a tripod, it can be less practical since
    the number of scanning locations has to be increased to register enough data to
    cover the target area, hence increasing sampling time (Lin et al., 2010). Morevover,
    MTLS can also carry other sensors, such as RGB or hyperspectral cameras while
    benefiting from monitoring when performing other agronomical tasks. The geometric
    data collected by an MTLS is essential for vineyard management. Site-specific
    crop management lessens agrochemicals environmental impact and lowers economic
    costs. Furthermore, in perennial fruit crop production systems such as vines,
    the vegetative and reproductive growth in any given year can affect the next year’s
    yield. Hence, site-specific management also impacts the ratio of vine size to
    the mass of fruit harvested, i.e., crop load. Thus, genetics, training systems,
    pruning strategies, and irrigation affect grape production (Taylor et al., 2019).
    Concerning lowering pesticides, spraying technologies must be optimized, and plant
    protection product (PPP) doses must be adjusted according to vegetation structure
    (Llorens et al., 2011a, Walklate et al., 2011). Nonetheless, the uniform application
    of agricultural inputs is a common practice in most agricultural regions (Andújar
    et al., 2019). Over the past two decades, several advancements to adjust the flow
    rate according to the vine geometry have been presented toward more accurate and
    effective spray systems for various crops, including vineyards. However, these
    dosage advancements of plant protection products using different sensing technologies
    varied in their underlying premises and calculations since most are based on a
    canopy characterization (Cheraïet et al., 2020). In order to optimize the use
    of PPP in viticulture and fertilizer application in a differential manner, the
    structural properties of the vegetation must be considered, for example, just
    using height as a criterion (Andújar et al., 2019) as a simple canopy measurement.
    Due to the current regulatory system and the increasing public demand for a reduction
    in the use of pesticides in vineyards, the entire plant protection process has
    been reviewed (Cheraiet et al., 2021). Regarding dose calculation, there are two
    interconnected issues. On the one hand, some authors consider canopy development,
    mainly controlled by growth stages, training systems, and varietal traits, to
    set a new dose expression for more efficient use of PPP. On the other hand, how
    to define and select the most appropriate crop parameters, i.e., canopy architecture,
    to adjust dose rates locally (Cheraiet et al., 2021). Manual retrieval of vine
    dimensions is possible (Rosell Polo et al., 2009b), as are sensor-based measurements
    (Paulus, 2019). However, manual measurements are tedious and error-prone and necessitate
    the extrapolation of readings from a few points throughout the whole field (Taylor
    and Bates, 2013), which assumes typically that crop attributes, i.e., geometry,
    are uniform. For example, Gil et al. (2014) demonstrated in vineyards (cv. ‘Merlot’)
    that manual measurements could overestimate canopy thickness compared to LiDAR
    measurements by about 30% in some cases, resulting in unnecessary overdose. Conventionally,
    tree row volume (TRV) (Byers et al., 1971) and leaf wall area (LWA) (Koch, 1993),
    the latter proposed by EPPO in 2016, are regarded as appropriate dose expressions
    for PPP (Gil et al., 2019). They have been calculated through basic manual measurements
    of key canopy geometric traits, i.e., inter-row distance, height, and width. Moreover,
    estimating vine canopy growth and predicting plant input requirements can be done
    by measuring leaf area and leaf density (Del-Moral-Martínez et al., 2016). LiDAR
    sensors, as a contactless technology for rapid canopy measurement, enable the
    calculation of TRV, LWA, LAI, or LAD; hence site specifically, application rates
    can be determined. Vine crop characteristics can be estimated according to individual
    architectural vegetative traits, also BBCH stages, i.e., phenological stages,
    over the season (Cheraïet et al., 2020, Rinaldi et al., 2013, Sanz et al., 2018).
    Other variants related to vines structure, such as pixelated leaf wall area (PLWA),
    can account for LAI as an explanatory variable in appropriate linear regression
    models (Del-Moral-Martínez et al., 2015) or LWA by points (Bastianelli et al.,
    2017). Also, the tree area index (TAI) (Walklate et al., 2002), as the ratio of
    crop detected area to the ground area, can be used to predict LAI (Arnó et al.,
    2013). Due to the high goodness of fit between LAI and TAI (R2 = 0.92), Arnó et
    al. (2013) confirmed that LiDAR sensors can properly assess foliage characterization
    of vines (cv. ‘Merlot’) regardless of the scanned side of the row. Furthermore,
    scanning both sides of the row implies more complex 3D modelling. Nevertheless,
    for example, LAI could be estimated from only one side of the row, lessening the
    complex management of LiDAR data (Arnó et al., 2015, Colaço et al., 2018). Another
    form of simplifying field operation would be setting the optimal length to be
    scanned. In vines (cv. ‘Syrah’) trained in vertical shoot position, Arnó et al.
    (2017) concluded that lengths of 0.5 m are unsuitable when using MTLS. The authors
    concluded that further studies would be necessary to address the effect of the
    cultivar or the training system for lengths of 1–2 m. Onboard 2D push-broom LiDAR
    sensors can be used to evaluate the structure of vine canopies indirectly. Enhancing
    spatial resolution, hence addressing the known spatial and temporal variability
    in canopy size with sufficient precision in precision agriculture applications
    (Arnó et al., 2013, Colaço et al., 2018), thus, precision viticulture applications.
    In 2009, in apple, pear orchards, and a vineyard (cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ and
    ‘Merlot’), Rosell Polo et al. (2009a) proved LiDAR systems as valuable tools for
    determining, TAI and LAI. LiDAR measurements were taken on both sides of the vine
    rows before and after the defoliation of specific trees, displacing the sensor
    parallel to the rows at a known constant speed. Manual and sensor-based measurements
    of the vegetative volume of tree-row vines showed a significant correlation (R2
    ranging from 0.81 to 0.92). Later on, the same research group (Rosell et al.,
    2009b) in the same crop setting but adding citrus trees, obtained 3D digitalized
    images of vines with the help of fixed reference planes, i.e., know fixed points
    to be distinguished in the point cloud, in order to register scans in a single
    point cloud. Height, width, volume, LAI, and LAD were calculated with a high degree
    of concordance compared to manual estimation. Different error sources related
    to misalignments and other external factors for the left and right 3D point cloud
    superposition are explained. Also, a detailed explanation of laser beam characteristics
    when impacting the target is addressed. Sanz et al. (2013) employing the measuring
    system developed and validated in vineyards by (Rosell et al., 2009a, Rosell Polo
    et al., 2009b, Sanz-Cortiella et al., 2011a, Sanz-Cortiella et al., 2011b), examined
    the relationship between tree row LiDAR-volume (TRLV) and LAD in apple, pear orchards,
    and vines (cv. ‘Merlot’ and ‘Cabernet’). A good logarithmic fit of volume and
    leaf area estimations of vines showed a mean correlation coefficient of 0.87.
    It was also stated that no differences were found when calculating the LAD using
    LiDAR with angular resolutions of 1° or 0.5°. Further, the height position of
    the LiDAR influenced LAD estimates, concluding that the point with the highest
    R2 and, consequently, the best correlation between TRLV and LAD was the lowest
    at 1.2 m of the three examined positions (2, 1.6, and 1.2 m above ground level).
    Although equivalent information could be acquired by 3D stereography employing
    digital stereo frames, LiDAR is far more practical and simple to utilize (Jones
    and Grant, 2015). Later on, Sanz et al. (2018), in a total of 17 blocks of pear,
    14 of apple, and 26 of vine (cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon,’ ‘Merlot,’ ‘Tempranillo’
    and ‘Syrah’), in different phenological states found a strong logarithmic correlation
    (R2 values of 0.85, 0.84, and 0.86 in apple, pear, and vine, respectively) considering
    TRLV as a good variable to estimate LA. Interestingly the authors proposed a manual
    alternative method to estimate LA. Height, depth (width), and visual estimation
    of the gap fraction using pictogram-based training were considered manual in-situ
    procedures. The outcomes reported using this simple technique were comparable
    to those obtained using LIDAR-based methods. Similarly, Arnó et al. (2013) proposed
    a configuration to provide a feasible method to assess the leaf area variability
    along a vine row (cv. ‘Merlot’). It was concluded that TAI has a high ability
    to estimate LAI (R2 = 0.92). Nonetheless, the insufficient number of scans and
    the difficulty of the data analysis for LAI estimation were regarded as a primary
    drawback of the study. However, these studies had to deal with misalignments from
    two sides due to accumulated errors of sensor poses. The sensor had to move at
    constant and very low speeds (1 km/h) despite using fixed references. In order
    to overcome these inaccuracies, other studies integrated GNSS systems (Cheraiet
    et al., 2021, Cheraïet et al., 2020, Llorens et al., 2011b), although orientation
    errors still exist particularly for large-scale scanning (Dong et al., 2020).
    Cheraiet et al. (2021), following a previous measurement system set-up used in
    (Cheraïet et al., 2020), adjusted the spray rate considering the local vegetative
    characteristics of vines (cv. ‘Marselan,’ ‘Chardonnay,’ ‘Cabernet Sauvignon,’
    ‘Petit Verdot,’ ‘Aranel,’ ‘Caladoc’ and ‘Syrah’). The prediction of the site-specific
    distribution of agrochemical spray deposition was assessed at multiple phenological
    stages, scanning only one side of the canopy by determining LWA. The proposed
    multivariate models could forecast the distribution of deposits from a typical
    face-to-face sprayer more accurately (R2 between 0.76 and 0.94) and robustly (RMSE
    between 10% and 24%) than LWA-based univariate prediction models across the whole
    growing season. The authors addressed the issue of poorly treated, hence unprotected,
    vine canopy areas. Notably, the proposed methodology can be adapted to changing
    canopy characteristics spatially and temporally over the season. However, despite
    GNSS systems combined with LiDAR improved accuracy, since the mobile platform
    changes its position with six degrees of freedom, an IMU (Zhao et al., 2021) would
    be a solution to accurately locate the 3D trajectory of the sensor (Zaidner and
    Shapiro, 2016). Subsequently, obtaining a reliable 3D point cloud can be enhanced
    by combining the timestamped data from RTK-GPS and IMU readings to augment the
    dimensional information (del-Campo-Sanchez et al., 2019). In table 2, regarding
    measuring approaches, studies integrating RTK-GPS and IMU devices can be found
    in contrast to those based on constant known mobile platform speed and reference
    planes. This approach was undertaken by del-Moral-Martínez in (Del-Moral-Martínez
    et al., 2015) to scan the vegetation of vines (cv. ‘Syrah’) to estimate the so-called
    pixelated leaf wall area (PLWA) as a predictor of LAI considering half-canopy
    vegetation. On the other hand, Del-Moral-Martínez et al. (2016) proposed a study
    focused on mapping LAI, concluding that MTLS can be used discontinuously in order
    to reduce the amount of data acquired. Thus, data storage capacity and computing
    processing power can be lowered. However, this approach would raise the budget
    due to the cost of an integrated RTK-GPS and IMU system to enable 3D cloud fusion.
    In addition, budget-friendly approaches can be exceeded apart from increasing
    data processing time. Moreover, it might inhibit the commercial applicability
    of the research methodologies, hindering widespread transferability. Instead of
    using 2D LiDARs by being displaced along the crop rows, another procedure to directly
    obtain the third dimension is employing 3D LiDARs or SLAM approaches. Lowe et
    al. (2020) applied a continuous-time 3D SLAM to a 2D spinning LiDAR mounted on
    a farm utility vehicle to assess canopy density. The spinning LiDAR offered wider
    fields of vision and repeated coverage at short time lapses. This system also
    guarantees that LiDAR beams from varying distances and angles reach within the
    canopies to prevent density underestimation caused by outer layers of the crop
    that intercept the laser path. The results showed, per vineyard panel, canopy
    density repeatability of 3.8% (relative root mean square error) for acquisition
    speeds of 5–6 km/h. In contrast, in (Chakraborty et al., 2019), a 3D LiDAR fused
    with IMU was used to compare the convex hull and voxel grid methods for measuring
    the canopy volume of apple trees and vines. The 3D models were used to compute
    the canopy volume, which were highly correlated with manual measurements, although
    vine canopy height had a lower correlation (R2 = 0.59) than apple trees (R2 =
    0.84). The difficulty of obtaining ground-truth measurements due to the continuous
    structure of vines could explain this low correlation. In this experiment, two
    approaches were undertaken to estimate ground-truth volume: (i) the canopy volume
    of each zone was determined by multiplying the product of the crop plant area
    and length as in (Rosell Polo et al., 2009b) (ii) the volume of each tree was
    approximated using a bounding box whose edges were equal to the maximum height,
    maximum width, and total length of each crop plant as in (Patrick and Li, 2017).
    However, the degree of accuracy in relation to these approaches is contingent
    upon the best standards that are implemented by the operators involved and can
    be quite time-consuming. Furthermore, these particular approaches do not consider
    interruptions in the canopy and can only serve as a rough estimate of the real
    volume. Hence the lower correlation values for vine canopy height are due to the
    continuous structure of the vines. Interestingly, Lowe et al. (2020) proposed
    a canopy density estimation solution implementing continuous-time 3D SLAM (simultaneous
    localization and mapping) in a vineyard. The authors coped with the lack of a
    practical means of obtaining ground truth of canopy density at vineyard block
    scales by combining digital twinning. From this, vineyard snapshots over several
    times within a season and across seasons can be compared. On the other hand, even
    though ground-truth acquisition are related to manual measurements, high accuracy
    close-up triangulation laser scanners have been employed to extract reference
    data (Rose et al., 2016). On the other hand, del-Campo-Sanchez et al. (2019) compared
    static 3D phase shift LiDAR (TLS), and mobile 2D laser scanners (MTLS). For thematic
    maps, a vine-shaped artificial object (VSAO) calibration method was employed to
    calculate vine wood volume as an indicator of vegetative vigour. TLS point clouds
    were more accurate when using the convex hull cluster method (Papon et al., 2013)
    (with a relative error of 6.40%), but MTLS point clouds utilizing the volume calculation
    from the trunk skeleton technique provided the most comprehensive and accurate
    results (relative error of 2.46%). MTLS can scan large areas accurately; however,
    the reviewed studies left several common improvements to explore further. Data
    acquisition and processing, i.e., avoiding manual steps to achieve an automated
    generated point cloud, have to be addressed. Also, to improve and refine algorithms
    to determine volumes. MTLS have been profusely used to demonstrate that LiDAR-based
    measurements can be used to 3D digitize vine structures to estimate crop vigour
    and crop load. Vineyards have a substantial carbon sequestration potential due
    to their extended life cycle, enabling carbon accumulation in woody biomass (Payen
    et al., 2021). However, biomass can be distributed in several parts (perennial
    roots, trunk, cordons, canes, berries, and leaves). Notably, the most measured
    structures in the studies presented in this review are canes (or shoots). To estimate
    their volume (linked to weight) and their relationship with vineyard yield. Hence,
    the more wood the vine produces, the more leaves and fruit will produce the vine.
    Furthermore, wood volume evaluation is a crucial parameter in vineyards for determining
    biomass production and carbon storage (Morandé et al., 2017). Transient biomass
    (canes/shoots and fruit) is commonly reported as crop yield per surface area and
    pruning mass (Tagarakis et al., 2018). Vine vigour can be measured not only by
    estimating LAI (Arnó et al., 2013) but also by weighing the winter cane pruning
    during the dormant stage of a vine for one growing season (Steyn et al., 2016).
    Counting and weighing one-year-old wood (shoots/canes) at pruning is the most
    effective method for evaluating vine balance in viticulture. The weight collected
    during the dormant period indicates the vineyard vegetative vigour status, i.e.,
    generative growth (Kicherer et al., 2017b). Hence, grape producers use it extensively
    for management (Moreno et al., 2020a, Smart and Robinson, 1991). Manual, thus,
    destructive methods for measuring wood biomass are time-consuming and labour-intensive.
    As a result, the ability to quantify pruning wood, i.e., pruning weight in winter
    in a quick and non-destructive manner, could provide an alternative method of
    determining vine vigour (Moreno et al., 2020b). Moreover, due to the habit of
    climbing using the twining and attachment mechanism to counteract the effect of
    gravity, the geometric structure of shoots is often unravelled and twisted, even
    within the same training system. However, despite the complex vine geometry, extensive
    research has been conducted using LiDAR systems. Due to the intricacy of wood
    crops, architectural characteristics are often measured manually (Escolà et al.,
    2017), hence subject bias leading to inaccuracies. In (Grocholsky et al., 2011),
    an RGB camera and two 2D laser sensors are mounted sideways on vineyard machinery
    for dense mapping of canopy size (cv. ‘White Riesling’). Their findings demonstrated
    a high correlation (R2 = 0.65) between laser-based volume measurements and dormant
    pruning weight. Siebers et al. (2018), employing a high-scan-rate LiDAR generated
    a point cloud with a positioning accuracy of 3 mm while evaluating the volume
    and pruning weight (ground truth) of the trunk and cordon. LiDAR scans showed
    very high correlations between pruning weight (R2 = 0.91) and vine wood (stem
    and cordon) volume (R2 = 0.76) in ‘Shiraz’ cultivar. Before and after pruning
    scans were used to determine pruning weight correlations. The post-pruning scans
    were utilized to correlate trunk and cordon volume. Using the Octree function
    within the free software CloudCompare, scans were voxelized. The proposed method
    demonstrates how the intensity of the backscattered laser allows visible distinctions
    between leaves at various phenological stages and wood. This is explained by the
    fact that the lowest intensity values are the least reflected (Andújar et al.,
    2013). Similarly, in (Moreno et al., 2020b), the geometric reliability of a 2D
    LiDAR was tested in a vineyard divided into different cropping systems. A meaningful
    relationship was found between actual values of vineshoot biomass and LiDAR volume
    values (R2 = 0.75) when compared to the number of scans (R2 = 0.85). However,
    the influence of individual treatments was of low significance. Nevertheless,
    even thin shoots were accurately detected, demonstrating the system''s accuracy
    in tough conditions such as defoliated crops. LiDAR systems have the potential
    to assess variability in vine vigour within vineyards. Thus delimiting different
    management zones can be performed as illustrated in (Tagarakis et al., 2018) in
    a two-year experiment (2010 and 2011) in a vineyard planted with cv. ‘Agiorgitiko.’
    Dormant pruning wood was mapped, analysing the number of impacts received by vine
    canes, and additional sensors were also employed. A significant relationship was
    found between yield with laser scanner data and pruning weight (R2 ranged from
    0.71 to 0.79). However, quality parameters (such as berry total anthocyanins)
    did not appear to be related to the dormant pruning biomass (R2 between 0.417
    and 0.63). Regarding NDVI, in the first year the flowering and harvest NDVI measurements
    had the highest agreement with the pruning weight, however in the second year
    the best degree of agreement was achieved at veraison with both laser scanner
    (R2 = 0.72) and wood weight (R2 = 0.73) measures. Furthermore, the agreement between
    laser scanner and wood weight measurements was very strong (R2 = 85.4 for both
    years), indicating that the zone maps generated by both measurements were virtually
    identical. Thus, the vineyard zones with higher number of impacts, imply higher
    density of primary shoots, thereby higher vine vigour. Thus, pruning weight can
    be also based on the number of impacts (Siebers et al., 2018) or scans (Moreno
    et al., 2020b) as an 2D approach, alternative to 3D modelling vine wood with similar
    satisfactory results. Table 2 provides information about recent state-of-the-art
    studies carried out with 2D and 3D LiDAR in vineyards and under laboratory conditions
    concerning geometric data extraction from vines. On the other hand, regarding
    vine canopy geometry, Fig. 1 illustrates some examples showing the different approaches
    through LiDAR techniques to extract geometrical information and classify grapevine

    geometry. 4.3. Complementary LiDAR applications In addition, in light of the capabilities
    of the LiDAR technology, complementary studies have been undertaken, even in combination
    with other sensors, in other areas apart from estimating vine vigour, yield prediction,
    plant protection products, or fertilizer dose. Interestingly, water deficit can
    be indirectly determined by measuring the leaf area of a plant. Tsoulias et al.
    (2019) reported a good correlation between the apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa) of the soil and leaf area (R up to 0.86), providing an indicator of the
    plant''s water needs (Tsoulias et al., 2019). Even though this study was conducted
    in an apple orchard, it could be undertaken in a vineyard since these crops behave
    similarly in terms of leaf arrangement, as shown in (Sanz et al., 2018). Despite
    the fact that morphological differences are apparent, i.e., leaf density, size,
    and crop structure. Thus, information obtained through LiDAR can be beneficial
    for optimizing and estimating monthly water requirements in orchards or vineyards.
    Regarding spray drift, it continues to be a significant problem in agricultural
    PPP, particularly for orchards and vineyards, in contrast to field crops such
    as cereals since different nozzle directions are set up, i.e., upwards, sideways
    and downwards (Bolz et al., 2022). In line with the research of (Cheraiet et al.,
    2021), Gil et al. (2013) characterized pesticide drift in vineyards (cv. ‘Merlot’).
    The effect of various operating parameters (nozzle type, sprayer characteristics,
    and air settings) on the total spray dose exceeding the target (distribution away
    from the canopy) was assessed using a 2D LiDAR to characterize the drifting cloud.
    The employed standard mist blower at low air flow rate, the LiDAR detected a higher
    number of drift drops and had a stronger correlation (R2 = 0.91) than for coarse
    droplets and a high airflow rate. It was stated that the droplet size affects
    the drift measurements, which would accord with the in-depth laser research by
    Sanz-Cortiella et al. (2011b) and air pressure. Notably, targeted spray reduces
    chemical applications and mitigates possible derived issues. Thus avoiding the
    movement of pesticides from the intended application site to unintended areas,
    where they can have negative impacts on non-target organisms, such as pollinators
    and other beneficial insects. In addition, the drift of pesticides from agricultural
    fields can contaminate nearby streams and rivers, potentially impacting aquatic
    life (Peris et al., 2022). Wang et al. (2017), in a study about precision spraying,
    proposed a mobile real-time targeted spray application for grapevine sucker control.
    A sucker identification system based on information fusion employing a static-based
    2D laser scanner and camera machine vision was developed to identify and detect
    grapevine suckers with a high recognition rate and relative location accuracy.
    The proposed algorithm achieved a width and height identification rate of 91.8
    and 88.2%, respectively, and relative position accuracies of 92.0% and 87.3%,
    which can be adequate for real-time mobile targeted spray. Concerning early yield
    estimation, as a critical success factor for growers and winemakers to improve
    key crop management strategies, it can be estimated by determining indices such
    as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), WI (Water Index) (Barriguinha
    et al., 2021) or LAI (Arnó et al., 2013), or by estimating dormant pruning weight
    (Moreno et al., 2020b). However, during the harvesting of grapevines, growers
    need to acquire an estimation of yield map to comprehend the vineyard variability.
    Moura et al. (2019) attached a LiDAR Lite v1, connected to a servomotor, to a
    vine harvesting machine developing an innovative method for obtaining a productivity
    map. Using GIS software, a productivity map was created by combining the GPS location
    of each vineyard harvest point with the corresponding production volume. However,
    the authors for further studies proposed taking another approach to obtain 3D
    information instead of profiles, hence improving the precision and accuracy of
    the method. In summary, the widespread use of MTLS instead of stationary approaches
    leads to satisfactory results in geometric reliability and the ability to scan
    more extensive areas. However, MTLS scanning is time-consuming since it generates
    large amounts of data to be post-processed for large-scale field applications.
    Hence, although LiDAR systems are fast acquiring data, the point cloud processing
    time can substantially increase when scanning large areas. 5. Depth perception
    for vineyard 3D scanning Distance-based sensors such LiDAR or ultrasonic have
    been widely explored in precision agriculture applications over the past two decades.
    However, depth sensors have entered precision viticulture along with the rapid
    progress of 3D modelling in the last few years. Depth sensors are relatively inexpensive
    and compact, offering sufficient resolution and frame rate to capture pixel-level
    colour and depth information. Due to these features, depth cameras offer a significant
    advantage in consumer-oriented applications compared to other costly scanning
    technologies (Xu et al., 2019). Recent depth sensor studies have focused more
    on controlled indoor environments, i.e., greenhouses (Milella et al., 2019). These
    sensors are often called RGB-D cameras if the RGB information is associated with
    depth. Hence, RGB and depth data are registered, and the pixels have a one-to-one
    correlation. However, it is worth noting that the RGB-D term must only refer to
    depth cameras that simultaneously provide colour and depth data. According to
    the 3-D image generation technique, the current generation of depth cameras operates
    on one of these three principles: structured light (SL), time-of-flight (ToF),
    stereo vision (SV), or active stereo vision (ASV). Each has its advantages and
    drawbacks (see Table 5). SL light involves projecting a known pattern of light
    onto an object and then measuring the deformation of the pattern to infer the
    object''s shape. Although SL provides high accuracy and high resolution, it is
    sensitive to ambient light, i.e., the need for a controlled lighting environment.
    In contrast, ToF measures the time it takes for a pulse of light to travel from
    the sensor to the object and back to determine the distance to the object. ToF
    depth cameras are relatively robust to ambient light providing high-range measurement.
    The drawbacks are lower resolution and limited field of view. On the other hand,
    SV involves capturing two or more images of an object from different viewpoints
    and then using the differences in the images to infer the object''s depth. These
    sensors do not need special equipment or controlled lighting and can be used with
    existing cameras. Their disadvantages are related to lower accuracy and relatively
    limited range. Furthermore, the most challenging aspect of stereo vision is accurately
    matching two camera viewpoints. Structured light illumination, i.e., ASV, has
    been utilized to determine the correspondences between the two views to address
    the issues of matching textureless objects (Shuang and Wang, 2021). In summary,
    structured light is best for high-accuracy, high-resolution 3D imaging in controlled
    environments, time-of-flight is best for range measurements in difficult lighting
    conditions, and stereo vision is best for simple, inexpensive 3D imaging using
    existing cameras. Table 4, which can be found at the end of this section, summarizes
    depth technologies considering lab and outdoor conditions according to the aforementioned
    measuring principles. When Table 4 is examined, it is seen that ToF approaches
    are actively explored in precision viticulture in vineyards. However, under laboratory
    conditions where lighting can be controlled, SL cameras are more suitable since
    sunlight strongly affects the projected pattern or makes the sensor unable to
    measure (Gené-Mola et al., 2020a). However, interestingly Hacking et al. (2019)
    captured SL data under lab conditions in a vineyard. Nonetheless, artificial illumination
    was used, screening the vines just before and after sunset. Table 5 provides detailed
    information about the depth camera functioning and main parameters. Table 4. Depth

    systems Recent comparisons of Intel’s portable consumer-grade RGB-D sensors to
    other current available SL and ToF cameras revealed that the new active stereo
    vision (ASV) sensors are well suited for outdoor agricultural phenotyping, with
    the added benefit of lower power needs (Kerry et al., 2021). Although this technology
    was developed decades ago, it has only lately been marketed as a commercial product
    (Fu et al., 2020). It should be noted that this series of sensors are based on
    active stereoscopy since it employs a single NIR texture projector in conjunction
    with two NIR cameras to determine depth, i.e., an infrared speckle and stereo
    vision technology to deal with low textures (Zhong et al., 2020). It is possible
    to create a texture by artificially projecting a particular pattern over a scene
    that lacks features. Therefore, active stereoscopy, hence ASV technology, projects
    a random light pattern that assists in triangulating extra features (Giancola
    et al., 2018). Intel has recently established a significant presence in the 3D
    sensor market, releasing sensors based either on SL and ASV, surpassing the popularity
    of the Kinect generation. Intel RealSense is an open platform that enables the
    company 3D perceptual devices to be exploited (Giancola et al., 2018). Milella
    et al. (2019) used the depth camera Intel Realsense R200 mounted on a mobile platform
    to assess canopy geometry and count grapevine bunches (cv. ‘Räuschling’). Four
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were implemented to segment images to recognize
    grape clusters (Fig. 2). Despite the low quality of the images, all deep learning
    frameworks could detect them, VGG19 being the most successful, with a value of
    accuracy of 91.52%. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download

    reduce false positives and false negatives. It is noteworthy that the foliage
    of distant plants resembles grape bunches in the foreground. Figure reproduced
    from Milella et al., 2019. This technique may replace the more expensive LiDAR
    sensor to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) canopy structures (Carvalho et al.,
    2021). Similarly, Kurtser et al. (2020b) also employed ASV to perform grape cluster
    detection and size estimation through RGB-D video stream using the newest version,
    D435, mounted on a mobile robotic platform. Basic shapes were fitted to the point
    clouds; ellipsoid for radii and cylinder for diameter and height estimation. The
    obtained average errors ranging from 2.8 to 3.5 cm compared to ground truth were
    attributed to sun exposure, leading to larger distortions of the acquired depth
    data. The authors stated that future work should include other more sophisticated
    geometrical fitting forms and validate the research in other vineyard conditions,
    i.e., different seasons, growing conditions, and cultivars. Notably, the camera
    could have operated as a stereo camera instead of AVS since the IR dot pattern
    does not work under intense illumination (Parr et al., 2022). Unlike SL, ASV captures
    the surface''s natural appearance without altering it. However, proper matching
    of stereo pairs depends on distinctive features in the scene, i.e., features in
    the surface texture (Ivorra et al., 2015). Few studies can be found using SV depth
    cameras that work without the help of textured IR projected patterns (hence, passive
    stereovision-based cameras). As aforementioned, these patterns improve the overall
    quality of the depth noise and the performance range, particularly in low-textured
    scenes. However, SV depth cameras are not suitable under very low-light environments.
    In lab conditions, although set-up was near field conditions, partial 3D models
    of grapevine clusters were extracted using an SV depth camera (Bumblebee2) (Ivorra
    et al., 2015). See Fig. 3 depicting the convex hull of the bunch calculated based
    on a 2D Delaunay triangulation and the bunch region of interest. The research
    was conducted with 100 grapevine clusters of ten distinc cultivars (‘Grenache,’
    ‘Pinot Noir’, ‘Graciano’, ‘Monastrell,’ ‘Mencia, Bobal,’ ‘Cabernet Sauvignon,’
    ‘Tempranillo,’ ‘Merlot and Carignan.’). Although the quality of images was low,
    support vector machine (SVM) models based on 3D descriptors assessed traits such
    as the number of berries, size, weight, and cluster compactness with satisfactory
    results (R2 ranging from 0.71 to 0.83). Download : Download high-res image (140KB)

    figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Due
    to their excellent capacity for feature extraction and autonomous learning, convolutional
    neural networks (CNN) have been utilized extensively in fruit recognition. Nevertheless,
    RGB images do not provide adequate information for 3D detection and reconstruction
    (Wang et al., 2022a). Thus, RGB-D images provide more robust information and accurate
    models in complex scenarios such as fruit detection as apples (Gené-Mola et al.,
    2019). Thus, this approach could be implemented to identify more robustly individual
    berries or clusters. In a more recent study, Yin et al. (2021) also employed SV
    technology using a low-cost binocular passive stereo camera (ZED 2 K) and NNs
    to detect grape bunches from point clouds (see Fig. 4). Cylinders were fitted
    to the point clouds to calculate the sagittal axis to estimate the pose of the
    grape bunch, thus a harvesting robot end-effector for collision-free picking.
    Each grape''s detection, segmentation of the point cloud, and pose estimation
    took approximately 1.7 s, which satisfies the criteria for real-time operation.
    The grape detection results of 210 test images showed an average precision, recall,
    and intersection of 89.53, 95.33, and 82.00%, respectively. Download : Download

    (original image left) showing point cloud detection results from Mask R-CNN under

    al. (2021) presented another approach of CNN but in the field of vine automatic
    pruning in lab conditions. An Intel RealSense D435i RGB based on ASV technology
    was used, attached to the end-effector to detect the spurs, hence the effective
    pruning points, using CNN (specifically, Faster RCNN; regions with convolutional
    neural networks). An average accuracy for spur detection of 68% was achieved.
    Since the reproducibility of robot pruning skills is complex due to the heterogeneous
    nature of vines in the vineyard the authors proposed further applications in real
    vineyard to test the lab approach. 5.2. Time-of-flight sensors for 3D modelling
    ToF (time of flight) employs active illumination, in which the time interval between
    light emission and reflection is precisely monitored using highly accurate time-measuring
    methods. ToF cameras, based on continuous-wave (CW) modulated light, emit near-infrared
    (NIR) light through light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which reflect back to the sensor
    (Wang et al., 2020). In this manner, measurements can be done simultaneously for
    thousands of points. ToF cameras are compact in terms of hardware size, though
    the limited resolution of the depth images, as well as the noise associated with
    depth data, are drawbacks (Gregorio and Llorens, 2021, Paulus, 2019). Moreover,
    ToF cameras have a significant benefit over LiDAR and SV systems since they can
    provide depth data at high sampling rates. When compared to expensive LiDAR sensors,
    when assessing small areas, geo-positioning the sensor can be avoided (Moreno
    et al., 2022). Examples of cameras using this technology based on CW-ToF are Mesa
    Imaging SR4000, CamCube PMD, and Microsoft Kinect v2 (Piatti and Rinaudo, 2012,
    Wang et al., 2020), RealSense L515, and Azure Kinect (Neupane et al., 2021), Senz3d
    (Fu et al., 2020). These sensors have been employed in a variety of precision
    agriculture applications due to their capabilities. In particular, these cameras
    have been used to detect plants or fruits in structural characterization (Narvaez
    et al., 2017). Despite the variety of ToF depth cameras, the consumer-grade RGB-D
    camera, namely Kinect v2 has attracted more attention among researchers. Hence
    Kinect v2 has been widely used for crop characterization in agriculture (Andújar
    et al., 2017a, Elfiky et al., 2015, Vázquez-Arellano et al., 2018a). Since Kinect
    v2 outperforms the previous version Kinect v1 based on SL in terms of operating
    in daylight conditions (Sarbolandi et al., 2015), the second version v2 has achieved
    satisfactory results in terms of vines reconstruction in daylight (Bengochea-Guevara
    et al., 2018, Moreno et al., 2022). In addition, the Kinect v2 sensor took the
    lead over other depth sensors in precision agriculture because of its reduced
    price and excellent performance. However, the released Azure Kinect in 2019, as
    a successor of Kinect v2, although suitable as a substitute in 3D scanning applications
    (Kurillo et al., 2022), cannot be used effectively under sunlight. Though in a
    narrow field of view mode, reliable depth measurements could be acceptable within
    a 1.5 m distance. However, it is virtually unusable for outdoor applications (Tölgyessy
    et al., 2021). Although other authors recommended it for imaging in daylight at
    distances up to 2–3 m (McGlade et al., 2020, Neupane et al., 2021), setting the
    optimal distance at 2 m (McGlade et al., 2020). Moreover, Intel RealSense L515,
    released in 2020, can also not operate in sunlight environments (Neupane et al.,
    2021). On the other hand, the comparably expensive Basle Blaze 101 as another
    ToF camera, though not present in agriculture applications, can work at full daylight
    according to the manufacturer, which corroborates the findings in (Neupane et
    al., 2021). In comparable studies to vineyards as woody crops, Elfiky et al. (2015)
    3D modelled apple trees using a Kinect v2 from only two views, from the front
    and back sides, showing accurate models to estimate essential parameters for pruning.
    The proposed scheme located the pruning points with an accuracy of 96%. They started
    out assessing the potential of a LiDAR sensor and the Kinect v2 for obtaining
    3D point clouds. Even though LiDAR provided high-quality data, the Kinect v2 showed
    high-fidelity 3D models of the dormant apple trees, hence being chosen for subsequent
    calculations. Andújar et al. (2017b) 3D modelled poplar trees at various wind
    speeds to estimate the LAI and their volume. The potential resolution of this
    sensor was effectively proven from zero to high wind speeds, being the 3D models
    appropriately reconstructed at high wind speeds. Therefore Kinect v2 capabilities
    in similar woody crops as aforementioned fueled its usage in vineyards since 3D
    models are also valuable in woody crops such vine plants, with some applications
    similar to those used in trees (Andújar et al., 2017a, Elfiky et al., 2015). Bengochea-Guevara
    et al. (2018) employed a compact mobile platform to depth scan vine rows. The
    proposed methodology featured an approach for correcting the drift introduced
    by 3D reconstruction of large crop rows, particularly in length, using full FoV.
    Nonetheless, when scanning small areas, the drift is negligible. However, in a
    previous vineyard study by Rosell-Polo et al. (2017), raw data from a Kinect v2
    and an RTK-GNSS receiver were synchronized using an autonomous hybrid car with
    user-adjustable speed. Different experimental set up were implemented, varying
    frame rates and FoV; ranging from a single-pixel column to a complete FoV. It
    was reported that frames acquired from a single slice as a light sheet 2D LiDAR,
    i.e., one vertical pixel column were the most accurate in reconstructing the vine
    shapes (errors up to 1.5%). Furthermore, when accurate geometrical characterization
    is not necessary, a larger field of view could be implemented to increase working
    efficiency. Yet, due to difficulties with gaps between images, when the partial
    and entire FOV were assessed, a lack of scanning continuity could be a factor
    limiting the usability of the system in the field (Vázquez-Arellano et al., 2018b).
    In (Andújar et al., 2019), in a vineyard planted with cv. ‘Tempranillo’, an economic
    study was undertaken to assess the dose reduction of fertilizer. The performance
    of Kinect v2 was compared with a LiDAR system (MTLS) and aerial photogrammetry
    by means of UAV. According to the prescription maps, the dose was lowered by up
    to 80% compared to the total dose in a standard application, i.e., based on the
    Tree Row Volume approach. A reduction in PPP on a comparable scale could mirror
    this significant reduction in fertilizer application. The utilization of aerial
    photographic techniques generated positive net returns, whereas on-ground technologies
    (LiDAR and Kinect v2) required a shorter acquisition time to be competitive. Using
    the same framework, employing a Kinect v2 aboard a mobile electric platform to
    maintain a constant speed and minimize vibrations Moreno et al. (2020a) assessed
    major vine geometric traits of vines. When average values were considered, the
    result indicated that the branch volume assessed by the proposed system had a
    good linear relationship with the reference measures, i.e., pruning weight (R2
    = 0.80 for dry biomass and vineyard yield (R2 = 87). However, when the statistical
    analysis was conducted separately for each treatment, the observed behaviour did
    not match expectations. Although the proposed system can produce accurate 3D reconstructions
    of vines, its inability to detect tiny structures, i.e. terminal segments of vineshoots
    less than 1 cm in diameter, may account for this discrepancy. The authors proposed
    to scan both sides of the vines in further worksto gather more comprehensive and
    accurate data so that thin structures are not sensed. Similarly, in (Moreno et
    al., 2022), the 3D vineshoot architecture (cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’) according
    to eight different training systems (Lyre, Geneva Double Curtain, Y-Trellis, Pergola,
    Single Curtain, Smart Dyson, Vertical Shoot Positioned -VPS-, and the head-trained
    Gobelet) was obtained during vine winter dormancy. High correlations were reported
    when comparing vineshoot dry biomass and calculated RGB-D volume (R2 between 0.683
    and 0.919) and the associated 3D points (R2 between 0.66 and 0.88) for vertical
    trained vines (Pergola, Single Curtain, Smart Dyson, and VSP). The high values
    obtained in vertical training vines could be related to the fact that these systems
    allow the vineshoots to grow within only one side of the trellis, in contrast
    to head-trained (Gobelet) and horizontally divided canopies (R2 less than 0.50
    and even close to 0.001) such as Lyre, GDC and Y-Trellis. This is explained since
    the depth nominal operating range of the sensor is 0.5–4.5 m but the maximum depth
    accuracy lowers when used outside and shoots and canes in horizontally divided
    canopies are out of the range of the sensor. Setting other view angles or scanning
    both sides of the crop rows could be a way for assessing these horizontally divided
    training systems, including the head-trained vines. However, data acquistiong
    and 3D processing would be more time-consuming. This study highlights the strengths
    and weaknesses of Kinect v2, showing the inability to sense branches further than
    1.9 m in daylight properly. In contrast, the system showed an outstanding performance
    for reconstructing vineshoots according to training systems based on vertical
    trellises. 5.3. Structured-light sensors on vineyard reconstruction These sensors
    work by projecting an IR pattern across the scene and examining the distortion
    of the image returned, providing accurate distance measurements. The camera captures
    an image for each pattern. This pattern (most commonly a grid or horizontal bars)
    is set in a particular temporal order. The 2D points on the pattern are related
    to their 3D information by measuring the pattern''s deformation (Paulus, 2019).
    Thus, the 3D model of the object is built using the deformation of the projected
    pattern on the object (Usamentiaga et al., 2014). Among SL sensors based on PrimeSense
    chips (ASUS Xtion, Occipital, Sense 3D), Kinect v1 is designed for the game industry.
    Due to its capacity to provide 3D information at a high frame rate, compactness,
    and low cost, Kinect v1 became popular in several branches of science (Gregorio
    and Llorens, 2021). One advantage over ToF cameras is the lower energy consumption
    since powerful LEDs are needed to disseminate the ToF signal (Giancola et al.,
    2018). Since SL cameras are intended to work indoors, they are typically used
    under controlled environments in laboratories or greenhouses for agricultural
    research (Narvaez et al., 2017). Kinect v1, the first Microsoft sensor intended
    for videogames, has been profusely used in precision agriculture in other crops
    different from vineyards since it provides valuable information for phenotyping
    purposes. Kinect v1 has been used in different applications, such as to determine
    the distinctive features of leaves of apple seedlings, rosebush, and yucca plants
    (Chéné et al., 2012), extracting structural parameters in sweet onions (Wang and
    Li, 2014) and cauliflowers (Andújar et al., 2016). Paulus et al. (2014) compared
    two inexpensive low-cost 3D imaging systems (David laser scanning and Kinect v1)
    to reconstruct sugar beet taproot and volumetric leaf structure. As a reference
    sensor, i.e., ground truth, the expensive and highly accurate laser scanner Perceptron
    V5 was used. The authors stated that Kinect v1 could substitute costlier laser
    scanners to parametrize plant organs, which would be an asset for low-budget research
    and suitable for small companies and institutions.Thus precision viticulture would
    also be benefited from these SL sensors. In vineyards, even though the best 3D
    reconstructions are obtained when the light conditions are dimmer (Rosell-Polo
    et al., 2015), several researchers have used this technology outdoors for vines
    characterization in daylight. Marinello et al. (2016) started exploring a Kinect
    v1 to estimate table grape bunches volume and mass that would estimate the expected
    yield before harvesting. Two viewing angles were tested, side-on and bottom-up,
    to evaluate the sensor position for volume estimation on two different varieties
    of grapes (‘Black Dan Ben Hannah’ and ‘White Dauphine grape’). Since row distances
    in vineyards are often less than 2.5–3 m, the authors concluded that the sensor
    positioned at 0.8–1 m from the plants was the most suitable location for the best
    resolution for mass estimation. Concerning the measuring errors, these were heavily
    impacted by the distance of the sensor from the grapes and by the diameters of
    the clusters. Under optimal scanning circumstances, variations as low as 10–15%
    can be estimated (lateral scanning). The results indicated that the scanning resolution
    deteriorated considerably as the sensor distance from the grapes increased. In
    light of the sensor capabilities, Marinello et al. (2017) used a Kinect v1 statically
    positioned in a vineyard to fast determine the three-dimensional structure of
    the grapevine canopy in two grapevine varieties. The results revealed a close
    relationship between digital analysis and manual measurements for both ‘Glera’
    and ‘Merlot’ grapevines. The volume can be linked to the number of leaves and
    their area, with an R2 value of 0.74 and 0.76. Given that the total canopy volume
    is determined not just by plant growth and leaf number but also by leaf size,
    these outcomes seem reasonable. Interestingly, these substantial linear correlations
    were observed despite Kinect v2 outperforming the functioning, although the second
    version is not immune to sunlight conditions. Hacking et al. (2019) compared 3D
    and 2D methodologies for yield estimation before harvest in cv. ‘Shiraz’. The
    RGB-D methodology functioned successfully indoors, since calculated volume of
    grape bunches was compared to the ground truth mass, with correlation coefficients
    of 0.95 and RMSE of 12.46 g at the bunch level. As expected, the field data collecting
    was hampered by solar irradiation, reducing the yield estimating capabilities
    significantly (R2 from 0.59 to 0.49) even though that data was acquired after
    sunset with artificial illumination or just before sunset. The authors suggested
    using Kinect v2 for future works due to its higher robustness to artificial illumination
    and sunlight (Rosell-Polo et al., 2015). In contrast, the 2-D RGB yield estimation
    results were more reliable both in field and laboratory conditions. Andújar et
    al. (2016) also pointed out that sunlight interferes with an RGB-D sensor, i.e.,
    Kinect v1, limiting its capabilities for in situ collection in broad daylight.
    As a result, this sensor usage is primarily restricted to indoor environments
    and short-range monitoring. Conversely, concerning this limitation, Rist et al.
    (2018) used a fairly expensive handheld high-resolution structured-light-based
    sensor (3D scanner of Artec Spider) to scan grape bunches from different cultivars
    such as ‘Uva rara,’ ‘Pearl of Csaba,’ ‘Cardinal,’ ‘Chasselas,’ ‘Chenin Blanc,’
    ‘Sauvignon Blanc,’ ‘Silvaner,’ and ‘Pinot Meunier.’ These grapevine varieties
    and phenotypically diverse breeding materials were used to verify the procedure
    on whole bunches. Compared to ground truth data, reliable phenotypic data were
    achieved for berry numbers with strong significant correlations (up to R2 = 0.95).
    However, the main issue is the restricted viewpoint on bunches; only partial scans
    are available in the field, resulting in truncated 3D point clouds with missing
    data. Mack et al. (2018) acquired 3D point clouds of grape bunches (cv. ‘Sultana,’
    ‘Sugraone,’ ‘Sugarthirteen,’ ‘Ruby Seedless,’ and ‘Prime’) in lab conditions as
    in (Rist et al., 2018) considering different combinations of colour and shape
    descriptors to label parts as berries or stems. RANSAC was used to fit spheres
    into the data to produce precisely one berry per region. As the spheres occupied
    just a portion of the ellipsoid-shaped berry, new enhanced areas were produced
    by storing the points around each sphere with an offset (see Fig. 5). Based on
    least squares fitting, an ellipsoid was placed into each of the final regions.
    Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.8 and 0.9 for the main diameters of the
    berries (considering an elliptical model approach) were achieved. The authors
    proposed further work on extended grapevine varieties, adapted to partial scans
    and followed the research by (Schöler and Steinhage, 2015) regarding parametric
    reconstruction of the whole stem structure. Download : Download high-res image

    Figure reproduced from Mack et al., 2018. (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) Later, Rist et al. (2019) extended their previous work by using
    lab scans of whole bunches (360°) as ground truth. Dense but partial point clouds
    of the visible side of grape bunches were collected directly in the vineyard.
    Collecting data in the field is much faster and non-destructive compared to lab
    procedures, yet the resulting point clouds and phenotypic values are incomplete.
    As a result, lab scans of whole bunches (360°) served as the ground truth. However,
    the number and viewing angles affect the performance of the 3D recordings, considering
    the geometrical characteristics of the measured plant. The best and most robust
    regression model was the support vector machine, which predicted phenotypic features
    (berry number, bunch width, bunch length, total volume) with an R2 between 0.70
    and 0.90. The best viewing angle must be determined based on the phenological
    stage of the crop and the required parameters, as concluded by Andújar et al.
    (2015) in a study of poplar seedlings. Nonetheless, 3D data collecting on a 360°
    view is only achievable in the lab (Rist et al., 2019). Furthermore, despite the
    Artec Spider sensor outstanding features that allow a 3D point accuracy of 0.05
    mm, frame rate (7.5 per second), and scanning distance range (25–30 cm) from the
    item, it is inadequate to be aboard a mobile platform. Moreover, these 3D scanners
    are expensive, take a long time to generate viable point clouds, and their utility
    in the field has yet to be proven (Parr et al., 2022). From a technical standpoint,
    when in movement, the sensor should travel at a very low speed and close to the
    objects. These constraints have been successfully addressed using other depth
    cameras based on ToF for vine characterization mounted on a mobile platform (Andújar
    et al., 2019, Bengochea-Guevara et al., 2018, Moreno et al., 2020a). 6. From planar
    to 3D: Digital photogrammetry Over the past decade, as computer power and consumer
    digital camera availability and affordability have increased. Thus, photogrammetric
    techniques such stereo vision (SV), and particularly structure from motion (SfM)
    and multi-view stereo (MVS), are becoming more prevalent in precision viticulture.
    SfM photogrammetry is an image-based method initially designed for fast, low-cost,
    and straightforward three-dimensional surveys of building structures or small
    objects (Fonstad et al., 2013). Thus, large-area 3D reconstruction in precision
    viticulture using UAVs has been benefited from SfM, producing vast literature
    (De Castro et al., 2021a, Singh et al., 2022, Tsouros et al., 2019). However,
    SfM-MVS advantages have also been transferred to ground-based photogrammetry in
    precision viticulture applications, though to a lesser extent. Table 6 at the
    end of this section provides information about the most relevant digital photogrammetry
    approaches, focusing on phenotyping purposes and vineyard yield estimation. Table
    7 provides information about consumer-grade cameras, focusing not only on the
    main specifications and camera models but also on the ease of use in terms of
    advantages and challenges to be overcome. In vineyards, the studies (Herzog et
    al. (2014); Kicherer et al., 2015, Rose et al., 2016, Kicherer et al., 2017a)
    employed the AVT GT-2300/2450 series (Allied Vision Technologies GmbH) as industrial
    cameras intended for extreme environment and fluctuating lighting conditions at
    high frame rates (29 fps at full resolution 2336 × 1752). Table 6. State of the

    camera images of the same scene (Gutiérrez and Marroquı́n, 2004). The two-camera
    approach in machine vision is based on the biological concept of stereovision
    (SV) which estimates depth based on the distance between the eyes. This is equivalent
    to the third dimension (Dominguez-Morales et al., 2012) since images capture the
    same scene from different points of view. Thus, stereo methods operate on two
    consecutive, hence overlapped, images or digital frames under known camera geometry,
    computing a disparity estimate at each pixel (Scharstein and Szeliski, 2002).
    Unlike RGB-D cameras, stereo cameras are passive since depth measurements are
    calculated by identifying common pixels in consecutive frames and evaluating the
    disparity, i.e., displacement. Hence, a given object location in one picture is
    shifted in the other image by a number of pixels inversely proportional to the
    object''s distance from the sensor (Raajan et al., 2012). Furthermore, stereo
    systems are more reliable under sunlight conditions, i.e., more robust to different
    lighting conditions, providing high-resolution measurements acceptable for measuring
    distant objects. However, there are drawbacks, such as correspondence issues and
    heavy computation loads (Kazmi et al., 2014). On the other hand, although depth
    cameras have increased their resolution over the years, they still struggle with
    strongly illuminated environments (Kurillo et al., 2022, McGlade et al., 2020,
    Neupane et al., 2021, Tölgyessy et al., 2021). Additionally, processing stereo
    frames offer certain benefits over other types of sensors, such as costly laser
    systems or game sensor technologies, such as the Kinect series, which have constraints
    in highly illuminated conditions and a smaller operating range (Herrero-Huerta
    et al., 2015). SV devices have been widely tested for vineyard monitoring since
    a key feature of SV is its capacity to build 3D point clouds with high resolution.
    3D information, along with the availability of colour information during point
    cloud processing, enables a more efficient segmentation. In addition, the widespread
    use of DL techniques has also helped SV techniques in terms of segmentation in
    vines, dividing them into classes such as grapes, leaves, and branches. In (Nellithimaru
    and Kantor, 2019), Mask-RCNN was applied to images of vines that were simultaneously
    used for 3D modeling. An air blower was used to avoid occlusions and increase
    grape visibility. This approach was also used in (Parr et al., 2021) as an alternative
    to just removing leaves as in (Dey et al., 2012, Herrero-Huerta et al., 2015).
    As derived from other studies, dealing with occlusions is a cross issue related
    to almost all technologies. In addition, in stereovision systems, the need to
    analyze vast volumes of data has long been a primary obstacle (Gregorio and Llorens,
    2021), and stereo-matching algorithms are usually very time-consuming (Kazmi et
    al., 2014). 2D machine vision techniques have been proposed in various research
    works to count or measure the size of berries, hence detecting grape bunches (Diago
    et al., 2012, Font et al., 2014, Nuske et al., 2014), yet occlusions constitute
    a significant hindrance in 2D approaches. Defoliation in vines can alleviate leaf
    occlusion problems, but it is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive (Kierdorf
    et al., 2022). Moreover, since the foreground, i.e., grape clusters, and the background
    depicting leaves or other crop plants are in a similar colour spectrum, artificial
    backgrounds are placed behind the canopies to help cope with this issue (Diago
    et al., 2012). 3D reconstruction approaches help overcome occlusions through leaves
    or grapes and crops presenting the same colour distribution (Kicherer et al.,
    2017a). Unlike 2D machine vision, in order to overcome these challenges, SV aid
    in achieving background subtraction due to depth reconstruction. Although SV approaches
    have been applied in precision agriculture to characterize the geometry of crops
    such as potatoes (He et al., 2003), wheat (Andersen et al., 2005), soybean (BISKUP
    et al., 2007), or sugar beet (Müller-Linow et al., 2015), literature is scarce
    on vineyards. However, a good example can be found in (Klodt et al., 2015); leaf,
    stem, and grape as phenotypic classes of ‘Riesling’ and ‘Villard Blanc’ are segmented
    using a standard consumer camera through dense stereo reconstruction. The authors
    developed a stereo reconstruction algorithm that removes the background from RGB
    images, avoiding the use of artificial backgrounds during image acquisition. The
    study showed good determination coefficients compared with manually labelled ground
    truth images (R2 = 0.93 and root-mean-square error of 3.0%). Similarly, using
    an extended prototype image acquisition system proposed by Herzog et al., 2014,
    Kicherer et al., 2017b presented a low-cost and time-saving method to estimate
    dormant pruning mass, focused on seedling selection for grape breeding. Digital
    images in combination with depth map calculation and image segmentation were proposed
    as a novel, non-invasive technique for acquiring objective data. Two alternatives
    to obstructing background elements, such as vines from another row, and to lessen
    the effects of uncontrolled lighting conditions were proposed using the same set
    of images to assess pruning weight. Firstly, using two monochrome cameras to acquire
    stereo images with a real background. Dense depth maps are computed, and subsequently,
    image segmentation is performed. Secondly, images are manually segmented against
    an artificial white background. The relationship between ground truth pruning
    mass and calculated pruning mass was examined for the automated depth segmentation
    of pictures. As a reference dataset, image segmentation was performed manually.
    The manually calculated pruning mass acquired by non-invasive manual segmentation
    demonstrated a correlation of R2 = 0.83 (RMSE = 0.12), while the automated segmentation
    of computed pruning mass showed a lower correlation of R2 = 0.44 (RMSE = 0.23).
    Automated segmentation underperformed compared to manual segmentation (as reference).
    The authors proposed future work to minimize the RMSE by improving image segmentation
    and enhancing standardized image acquisition. In lab conditions, Mendes et al.
    (2019) proposed a low-cost solution based on stereo images using two synchronized
    Raspberry Pi NoIR camera boards and NDVI for non-destructive LAI estimation. Segmentation
    was conducted based on the NDVI value and the depth acquired from the disparity
    map. The NDVI was used to differentiate between the trunks and the leaves. The
    measured LAI (ground truth) and the canopy volume of the vines, estimated from
    the crop 3D surface model were assessed. A coefficient of determination of 0.812
    was achieved. Then, the experiment was carried out on trees near the laboratory
    to test the performance for future trials in real vineyards though further improvements
    are required in the system architecture. Interestingly Liu et al. (2020) proposed,
    a calibration-free algorithm for 3D grape cluster using a single image, instead
    of stereo-pair imaging, for fast berry counting in-field from a smartphone in
    cv. ‘Chardonnay’ and ‘Shiraz’ varieties. Despite the excellent results, average
    accuracy of 99% for berry number and 92% for bunch weight, further improvements
    include an ellipsoid approach, avoiding the need for artificial backgrounds. Also
    to convert this novel algorithm into an app for farmers. Thus, further developments
    in algorithms for feature extraction in image analysis may lead the way for simplicity
    in assessing vine organs. 6.2. Structure from motion and Multi-View stereo methods
    Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View-Stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry enable 3D
    reconstructions at high resolution. A set of 2D images from different view angles,
    i.e., different orientations and positions, is processed to generate dense 3D
    point clouds. In contrast to SV, SfM-MVS does not necessarily need synchronous
    triggering since a single camera is moved along a planned path to cover the crop
    target with a high degree of overlap. SfM employs algorithms to identify matching
    features in the set of digital images and determines camera location and orientation
    based on the different positions of numerous matched features. Due to this measuring
    principle, in the common case of fruit detection in precision agriculture, SfM
    main advantage is twofold. Firstly, since SfM is a multi-view technique, the amount
    of fruit occlusions is reduced, a significant advantage for berry counting in
    vineyards or bunch detection. Secondly, the registration between frames is performed
    automatically, preventing the duplicate counting of fruits appearing in different
    images (Gené-Mola et al., 2020b). The primary distinction between SfM and conventional
    photogrammetry is using a new generation of image-matching algorithms that permit
    unstructured image acquisition. SfM was created to reconstruct, i.e., 3D photogrammetric
    restitution, the three-dimensional geometry of constructions and objects from
    randomly captured photos, while traditional photogrammetric approaches depend
    on strips of overlapping images taken along parallel flight lines (Fonstad et
    al., 2013). Based on these computations, overlapping images can be utilized to
    reconstruct a sparse or coarse 3D point cloud model of the target. In order to
    complete the SfM-MVS procedure, this 3D model is generally developed to a much
    finer resolution using Multi-view-Stereo (MVS) techniques (Carrivick et al., 2016).
    Since invariant feature points have to be identified in the set of images in the
    SfM process, several algorithms have been designed to detect them. To be highlighted
    are the scale‐invariant feature transform (SIFT) and speeded‐up robust features
    (SURF) (Carrivick et al., 2016, Probst et al., 2018). Although SfM-MVS is hugely
    popular in Geosciences due to the calculation of digital elevation models (Goetz
    et al., 2018), SfM-MVS is gaining interest in 3D plant modeling (Pound et al.,
    2014, Quan et al., 2006, Rose et al., 2015, Santos and Rodrigues, 2016, Yu et
    al., 2018). SfM-MVS workflow has been widely used in vineyards, particularly in
    grape cluster detection. In 2012, Dey et al. (2012) employed a consumer-grade
    camera to detect and reconstruct grapes before and after the start of ripening
    to estimate crop yield during the growing season. SfM algorithms obtained a dense-colourized
    3D point cloud that was classified into vine structures (branches, leaves, and
    grapes) using SVM. A classification accuracy of 96% (during ripening) − 98% (prior
    to ripening) was reached. Interestingly, Herrero-Huerta et al. (2015) generated
    partial 3D models of grape bunches (cv. ‘Tempranillo’) from lightly defoliated
    vines during the daytime. They managed to recover the non-visible side using convex
    hull techniques. Artificial targets of known dimensions on the ground were used
    to automatically scale the 3D point clouds. Analysis of bunch weight yielded a
    coefficient of determination of 0.75. However, recourse to scale targets entails
    a significant drawback for high throughput data acquisition (Rose et al., 2016).
    Utilizing automated methods and technology related to mobile robotics is yet another
    developing trend for analyzing the phenology of grapevines. Herzog et al. (2014)
    introduced the first steps of high-throughput phenotyping in grape (cv. including
    ‘Riesling,’ ‘Pinot Blanc,’ ‘Silvaner,’ ‘Kemer,’ ‘Pinot Noir,’ ‘Domfelder’ and
    ‘Regent’) breeding to detect shoots after bud burst and estimate berry size. Although
    struggling with the adverse effect of daylight conditions, monochrome cameras
    enabled the generation of 3D information. The depth calculation allowed the separation
    of the foreground, hence discarding the background, achieving a detection rate
    up to 94%. In contrast, in (Kicherer et al., 2015), images were acquired at night
    to achieve uniform lighting, enabling working under standardized lighting conditions,
    though artificial illumination was needed. A field mobile robotic platform was
    developed (Phenobot), comprising a multicamera system and an RTK-GPS system to
    assess berry size and colour. Using a MATLAB®-based tool (BIV) berry size was
    extracted. The BIVcolor assessed berry sizes between 9.8 mm and 13.9 mm. Using
    the same robotic platform, Rose et al. (2016) attempted to determine the number
    of berries (cv. Riesling) and their size, i.e., berry diameter, by applying MVS
    to georeferenced images. However, although each image was taken every 15 cm along
    the path through the inter-row area, night-time images were acquired at a very
    low speed (0.3 km/h). The lighting unit was manually triggered along with the
    RTK-GPS system, attached for image geotagging. Nevertheless, this procedure ensured
    a high overlap indispensable for dense and accurate point clouds. In addition,
    since points of a grape bunch are viewed from various perspectives, the high screening
    rate helps mitigate the impact of occlusion. Processing time was reduced since
    the usage of RTK-GPS aids in scaling the 3D model of the scene. Thus, this procedure
    eliminates the need of placing artificial scale targets or reference labels of
    known dimension as in (Herrero-Huerta et al., 2015, Kicherer et al., 2015). The
    point cloud was classied using import vector machine classification to segment
    the plant into grape bunches and canopy and to obtain phenotypic data such as
    grape bunch number, berry diameter, and berry diameter. The authors develop a
    berry detection algorithm (findBerries) which counted and determined the size
    of berries directly from the 3D point cloud. An RMSE of 0.5 mm was found for the
    berry diameter; concerning berry detection, a recall and precision over 77% and
    97% was achieved, respectively. The fluctuating lighting conditions and the different
    backgrounds are among the most significant technical hurdles when phenotyping
    grapevines in real field environments. In this regard, Kicherer et al. (2017a)
    developed a newer and robust field phenotyping platform (Phenoliner) that allows
    the standardized capture of high-quality and georeferenced sensor data of cv ‘Riesling’
    and ‘Acolon’. A modified grapevine harvester is modified to be equipped with three
    cameras stacked vertically with artificial lighting in an ad hoc tunnel to overcome
    the sun’s influence. Thus, to undertake MVS method in standardized lighting conditions
    for bunch/berry detection. However, since stereo vision is affected by a lack
    of surface texture or specular highlights (Kazmi et al., 2014), high-intensity
    reflection on berry arches and backgrounds led to 3D miscalculations. The authors
    proposed in future experiments to employ polarizing filters and background in
    a matt colour to lessen the adverse effect of highlights. Although the recently
    presented Phenoliner 2.0 is much faster, the operating speeds of these abovementioned
    mobile platforms either generate images with poor quality or are too slow to adjust
    to the typical operating speeds of 10–15 km/h of agricultural machinery (Zheng
    et al., 2021). Moreover, enhanced automatic image acquisition and position variations
    of plant parts due to windy conditions hinder the matching process, limiting the
    screening of larger areas (Gregorio and Llorens, 2021). SfM–MVS based-systems
    can generate organ-level 3D vine reconstructions since a high level of geometric
    detail is essential to detect and count individual berries or assess fruit size.
    However, at the cost of being limited for real-time applications due to the high
    computational time required to generate dense 3D point clouds (Gené-Mola et al.,
    2021). In the field of dendrology, Bou et al. (2019) used SfM-MVS as an alternative
    to characterize the structure and volume of woody crops, such as vineyards, using
    LiDAR techniques (Rosell and Sanz, 2012). A single commercial camera was employed
    to accurately measure vine trunks diameter, volume, cross-sectional area, and
    circumference. Grapevines (cv. Riesling) of different ages were assessed successfully.
    Regression analysis revealed a high correlation between trunk diameter in the
    direction of the row and perpendicular to the row for all three vine ages, i.e.,
    achieving R2 close to unity. Interestingly, although an excellent fit of the data
    was shown, the RMSE of younger vines was greater due to the difficulty of applying
    SfM-MVS to thin structures. As stated in forestry applications, the inability
    to capture sufficient pixels to provide a complete image for SFM reconstruction
    is a known issue (Morgenroth and Gomez, 2014). Hence, slender branches can not
    be appropriately assessed as in vines. 7. Future trends on vineyard modeling and
    actuation This study examines a wide variety of sensing technologies for precision
    agriculture-based production of vines. The following needs and future directions
    have been identified as a consequence of these assessments. Precision viticulture
    has the potential to aid in reducing agrochemicals while boosting yields along
    with reducing inputs considerably. Precision viticulture primary objective is
    to evaluate the health, vigour, and physiological requirements of the vines in
    different areas of the vineyard to adjust traditional cultivation practices to
    be more site- and time-specific (Ammoniaci et al., 2021). Precision viticulture
    uses advanced technologies such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS),
    geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal sensing, and artificial
    intelligence (AI) to gather detailed data on vineyards from 3D and 2D traits.
    Geometric characteristics such as canopy height, width, leaf area index, or pruning
    wood volume can be extracted and analyzed to make site-specific decisions to optimize
    grape and wine production. Therefore, by integrating these technologies, precision
    viticulture can benefit from accurate, georeferenced, or real-time data on key
    parameters such as plant health, vigour, and physiological needs. Hence, allowing
    a more precise and targeted vineyard management. Also, the possibility to visualize
    and analyze spatial and geographical data using GIS software can be used to identify
    vineyard areas (at parcel level or even at individual plant level) with different
    growth patterns, soil types, or other characteristics that may impact grape production.
    Moreover, variable rate technologies (VRT) can be used to adjust inputs such as
    fertilizer, pesticides, or water based on the specific needs of different vineyard
    areas, reducing waste and increasing efficiency. In addition, AI can be used to
    analyze the data collected from various sources, such as ground and remote sensing,
    weather, or soil data, to predict disease outbreaks or identify areas of the vineyard
    that are most at risk of pest infestation. Overall, integrating these technologies
    can provide vineyards with the tools they need to make data-driven decisions that
    can improve grape quality, increase yields, and reduce production costs while
    remaining environmentally and financially sustainable. Nonetheless, effective
    and efficient decision support systems are still a challenge. In this context
    of precision viticulture, ultrasonic sensors were early adopted to assess vine
    traits, i.e., canopy structure in terms of thickness and height, and width to
    improve plant protection products application (Gil et al., 2007, Palleja and Landers,
    2017). However, ultrasonic sensor usage has steadily decreased and become less
    attractive due to new sensors such as depth cameras or photogrammetric techniques.
    Although other more advanced alternatives are doing away with ultrasonic sensors,
    these might reemerge into further vineyard developments and applications due to
    the newest ultrasonic transducers. Novel highly directional low-frequency array
    of ultrasonic transducers can improve the ability to penetrate at multiple depths
    through the outer parts of the vines (Parr et al., 2021). In addition, LiDAR and
    ultrasonic sensors, also known as distance sensors, are less affected by lighting
    conditions which is a significant advantage when outdoors in vineyards, compared
    to photogrammetric techniques. However, colour or spectral information is not
    provided. The typical LiDAR system is a push-broom device that utilizes a single
    band of near-infrared light to generate 3D point clouds. However, recent advances
    in laser technology have made possible dual-wavelength, multispectral (Strothmann
    et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2012) such as fluorescence (Zhao et al., 2020) for crop
    and vegetation detection or dual-wavelength (Mark et al., 2018) and multiple-wavelength
    (Hopkinson et al., 2016) even hyperspectral (Hakala et al., 2012, Kaasalainen
    et al., 2016) laser scanners in forestry. Since different materials (such as soil,
    woody parts, leaves, or fruits) have different spectral properties, these systems
    used in forestry and horticultural applications can be transferred to vineyards.
    The multi-wavelength LiDAR could be used to acquire a deeper insight into the
    vine structure and health status. Manifold studies can be found in forestry applications.
    The studies range from using dual-wavelength LiDARs, as in (Hancock et al., 2012),
    to detecting changing proportions of tree canopies and ground (measuring canopy
    height with an RMSE of 2.88 m and bias of –23 cm); to incorporating dual LiDAR
    intensity metrics from the stem and canopy to identify early bark-beetle infestations
    in spruce trees with an overall accuracy of 90% (Junttila et al., 2019). However,
    more research is needed to assess the integration of at least dual-output laser
    bands to better understand the optical response within the canopy, separate the
    woody and leafy parts, and study different viewpoints. Thus, in future applications,
    these types of multi-wavelength lasers can simultaneously provide 3D vine architecture
    and physiological states for precision vine monitoring. In contrast, most depth
    sensors provide colour information though the resolution is lower but at high
    frame rates, being more affordable than LiDAR sensors. Another facet to be considered
    is that at the cost of the high resolution of the LiDAR systems, hence producing
    a large volume of data to be processed, the possibility of adapting them in vineyards
    to variable rate application is prevented (Campos Tobajas et al., 2019). On the
    other hand, depth technologies (ASV, SL, and ToF) emit light in the near-infrared
    domain, making them susceptible to interference from internal camera reflections
    and the varying reflectivity of target objects (Neupane et al., 2021), as in the
    case of vine organs or woody parts. Since visible light also encompasses all infrared
    wavelengths, sensors performance may worsen in direct sunlight (Fu et al., 2020).
    Future ToF devices would target terrestrial sun irradiation minimum at 940 nm
    when designed for sunlit environments (Neupane et al., 2021), particularly in
    vineyards rather than lab conditions. Another common issue shared with other sensors
    is coping with occluded parts and self-occlusions in vines, so there is still
    room for improvement in developing more effective detection algorithms. In SL,
    high lighting levels also probably interfered with the projected pattern. Using
    IR filters or operating at night or with low illuminance levels (below 100 lx)
    are possible solutions (Rosell-Polo et al., 2015) while performing another agronomic
    task in the vineyard. Moreover, since SL is highly affected by vibrations, i.e.
    movements of the target crop, in uncontrolled environments, a possible solution
    would be using at least two laser stripes to provide redundant information at
    the cost of more complex calibration (Usamentiaga et al., 2014). This would be
    helpful when screening using sensors aboard a tractor that operates under mechanical
    oscillations due to uneven and rough terrain in vineyards. Thus, the vibrations
    leading to corrupted, distorted data would be compensated, hence obtaining a high
    signal-to-noise ratio. However, due to the adverse effects of strong daylight
    environments on optical sensors, this approach would be advisable for night screening
    as an alternative to similar research studies in vineyards as in (Kicherer et
    al., 2015, Rose et al., 2016). Similarly, in stereo-photogrammetric approaches,
    SfM performance is also impacted by windy conditions, comparably to vibrations,
    producing mismatching and misalignments. Thus, the ever-changing field environment
    of the application in vineyards, including illumination and planned working distance,
    must be considered in order to elect the most appropriate depth sensor. In any
    case, when sensing vine canopy structures, only the outer and non-occluded parts
    of the vines are accessible to image-based approaches. An accurate yield forecast
    for wine grapes enhances winery efficiency and marketing strategies. Furthermore,
    an accurate early season prediction enables producers to manage vineyard yields
    to satisfy grape quality goals appropriately (Liu et al., 2017). Thus, forecasting
    vineyard productivity is essential for vintage scheduling and optimizing winemaking
    processes. Plant phenotyping is an emerging discipline integrating diverse methods
    and procedures to quantify plant properties (such as growth, morphology, architecture,
    function, and composition) at multiple organizational sizes. Manual phenotyping
    continues to impede the advancement of plant and agricultural breeding (Carvalho
    et al., 2021), which currently relies on expert visual scoring that is time-consuming
    and can introduce bias. Thus, integrating sensing techniques to measure and assess
    traits over time became a field for innovation to promote breeding programs and
    evaluate vine quality before and after harvesting. In 1998, LiDAR sensors were
    initially utilized in viticulture to assess many viticultural parameters defining
    leaf distribution and features of the light microclimate of the canopy. This constituted
    a substantial achievement in the indirect, rapid, repeatable, and non-destructive
    estimate of crucial viticultural traits(Mabrouk and Sinoquet, 1998). Phenotyping
    these variables across time improves selection efficiency in plant breeding and
    field management, predicts genotype yield potential, and investigates stress tolerance
    and disease resistance. More recently, 3D approaches allow a twin model of the
    plant crop to assess key phenotype traits objectively. Mack et al. (2017) used
    the 3D sensor Perceptron Scan Works V5 as (Paulus et al., 2013, Schöler and Steinhage,
    2015) performed a 3D reconstruction and phenotyping pipeline for grape bunches
    using methods of machine learning and object recognition. However, the main issue
    is the creation of a gold standard. In future developments to reduce reliance
    on large training sets, semi-supervised and un-supervised learning similar to
    (Wahabzada et al., 2015) can avoid the use of a gold standard at all. Photogrammetric
    approaches have also been implemented to monitor grapevine growth and estimate
    crop yield (Dey et al., 2012, Herrero-Huerta et al., 2015, Kicherer et al., 2017a).
    In this regard, grape detection is the initial stage in yield forecast automation.
    Image processing methods offer the benefit of swiftly processing vast amounts
    of data without destroying field samples. Furthermore, stereophotogrammetric approaches
    can be combined with other sensors, such as NDVI and hyperspectral. Then, implementing
    machine learning techniques is feasible to enable more robust high-throughput
    phenotyping by measuring different phenotypic traits such as yield parameters
    and health status into account (Kicherer et al., 2017a). However, further improvements
    are needed to reduce the number of wavelengths and speed up the mobile platform,
    although the latter could influence the airflow moving the vine structures. Also,
    improvements in cancelling undesired effects due to light reflections are needed
    by using, for example, polarizing filters or backgrounds in matt colours. Regarding
    depth sensors, ASV cameras, such as the newer Intel D435 series suitable for outdoor
    agricultural-oriented tasks (Vit and Shani, 2018), have also been employed to
    estimate yield. Kurtser et al. (2020b) developed a method for cluster size assessment
    for yield estimation using machine learning approaches using the ASV camera (Intel
    D435) in a vineyard. However, this system to be improved will need larger data
    sets, the assessment of more viewpoints, and to deal with occlusions, the main
    drawback of non-destructive image analysis methods. However, an alternative could
    be found in computer vision by obtaining 3D info from 2D data. Interestingly,
    Liu et al. (2020) achieved 3D modelling from 2D images as a new methodology to
    count the total number of berries for a bunch. The accuracy of the approach was
    89% when directly compared to the number of berries in a bunch, using just a single
    image from a smartphone and no calibration or prior information. The processing
    time per image was less than one second, enabling its usage in the field. Since
    every image (that contained the measured bunches) is located, it is feasible to
    map bunch weight and yield variation across the vineyard. Furthermore, widespread
    mobile phone ownership, this breakthrough in the future, can cope with teaching
    farmers and smallholders in rural areas about the technological affordances smartphones
    provide. On the other hand, another alternative to assess vine grape yield vine
    can be using a low-cost vision system and a shoot detection framework. Liu et
    al. (2017) developed a novel computer vision technique through machine learning
    techniques without requiring manual labelling to build a classifier for automated
    yield estimation based on vine shoot detection. However, future improvements are
    required to accurately estimate the bunch-to-shoot ratio, i.e., bud fruitfulness
    on a larger scale. Thus, this technique could be an alternative to LiDAR approaches
    based on modelling vine shoots using 2D (Moreno et al., 2020b, Siebers et al.,
    2018, Tagarakis et al., 2018) or 3D LiDARs (del-Campo-Sanchez et al., 2019) that
    are more expensive and to require to reduce manual cloud editing processes such
    as noise filtering or extracting the target shoots. Furthermore, although some
    digital photogrammetry techniques are relatively mature, there remains ample room
    for improvement. In contrast to ASV sensors or LiDARs, digital cameras do not
    work properly due to poor lighting conditions. Moreover, varying lighting conditions
    during image acquisition in vineyards affect image segmentation and 3D reconstruction
    processes. Therefore, different approaches have been studied to cope with this
    issue, such as artificial backgrounds (however sometimes sunlight is unavoidable),
    self-developed tunnels, or just screening vines at night. However, to transfer
    this know-how to commercial applications for large plot vine monitoring, camera
    sensors have to be robust to lighting variation, thus adapting to real field conditions.
    Across all sensors, spatial resolution and the influence of a changing illumination
    environment are relevant. Moreover, acquiring denser point clouds is a key parameter
    to extract accurate vine traits. Temporal resolution has also to be addressed
    in monitoring vineyards, for example, in critical stages such as prior harvesting
    or selecting the right timing for plant protection products application. Moreover,
    the advent of digital twins as a surrogate of a real-life virtual representation
    of an object can signify a breakthrough in productivity and sustainability, breaking
    temporal barriers. As a result, farmers may manage their operations remotely based
    on (near-real-time) digital data rather than relying on direct observation and
    manual tasks on-site. This enables them to take quick action in the event of (anticipated)
    deviations and to model the impact of actions using real-world data (Verdouw et
    al., 2021). The Digital twin is a compelling principle with a bright future in
    agriculture, with current research encompassing a variety of use-cases, including
    crops, robotics, and aquaponics, enabled by Internet-of-Things, machine learning,
    and cyber-physical systems technology. Hence, digital twins can bring a high-fidelity
    digitization that can provide an excellent potential to enable modelling, simulation,
    and automation of dynamic systems in complex and dynamic environments such as
    agriculture (Purcell and Neubauer, 2023), thus vineyards. However, in agriculture,
    digital twins are not yet widely used (Pylianidis et al., 2021). Other areas for
    further improvements are related to the development of gold-standard datasets
    (Rasheed et al., 2020), storage capacity, calibration, and integration of different
    sensors and computational power. Hence, as the amount of data derived from machine
    learning and big data techniques increases to be analyzed, decision support systems
    will be vital to improving automation processes. 7.1. Machine learning trends
    in vine characterization In the field of learning-based feature extraction methodologies,
    substantial advancements have been achieved due to the rapid development of image
    processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (Wang et al., 2022b).
    State-of-the-art techniques in image analysis consist of deep learning using neural
    networks and recurrent neural networks as standard deep learning networks in precision
    agriculture (Altalak et al., 2022). Due to its capacity to address difficulties
    in computer vision and pattern recognition, neural networks (CNNs) have recently
    achieved remarkable success in a wide variety of precision agriculture applications
    (Bharman et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2022b), which can be transferred in the near
    future to precision viticulture applications. However, the design of NNs architectures
    that enable the direct processing of point clouds as dense in vine plants is currently
    posing a major challenge. Over the past few years, approaches based on deep learning
    have shown to be more robust and less impacted by fluctuating illumination conditions
    than conventional methods. Combining the depth information collected by RGB-D
    cameras with RGB and infrared information has also increased robustness, limiting
    the effect of lighting conditions and enhancing fruit identification outcomes
    (Fu et al., 2020). This approach represents a significant leap to prospective
    agronomic management in vineyards as yield forecasting and harvesting. On-the-go
    operations in computer vision using neural networks (Aquino et al., 2018) to achieve
    real-time monitoring are feasible. However, a significant drawback to obtaining
    accurate 3D models from stereo-photogrammetry is the large computational power
    required. In the field of depth cameras, for example, the results presented by
    Milella et al. (2019) using ASV to automate bunch image segmentation using CNNs
    for pixel classification may have paved the way for future applications in the
    grape cluster and berry detection. However, extended data sets would be needed
    to improve the training of the CNNs. This includes labelling larger data sets
    according to a higher number of classes, i.e., different phenotyping stages, colours,
    and grape varieties. Moreover, using RGB-D data has the added benefit of supplying
    the detection network with both RGB and depth data, in contrast to the current
    standard approach, which only uses RGB data. However, for example, in photogrammetry
    approaches to counting grapes, SfM aids in estimating the 3D position along the
    camera path, thus avoiding counting the detected grape twice. Therefore, using
    depth sensors or photogrammetric approaches, the third dimension aids in detecting
    and segmenting. For example, to integrate reliable and robust fruit-detection
    algorithms for harvesting robots. In this regard, Yin et al. (2021) implemented
    deep learning techniques to achieve accurate picking by segmenting images from
    an SV sensor in a vineyard. Moreover, the proposed approach showed excellent detection
    and segmentation results under different lighting conditions, i.e., cloudy and
    sunny conditions, also including front-lighting, back-lighting, and side-lighting.
    Unlike Santos et al. (2020), combined SfM and CNN, and voxelization was employed
    to obtain grape point cloud data. Notably, for future commercial applications,
    the detection, point cloud segmentation, and posture estimate for each grape took
    around 1.7 s, which satisfies the real-time operating requirements. Furthermore,
    on-the-go operations in computer vision using neural networks (Aquino et al.,
    2018) to achieve real-time monitoring are feasible. However, a significant drawback
    to obtaining accurate 3D models from stereo-photogrammetry is the considerable
    computational power required. Future developments using deep learning need to
    expand the quantity of training data and fine-tune the model architecture. As
    aforementioned, computational capacity is an obstacle to deep learning implementation
    in precision viticulture. Model training is becoming more computer resource intensive
    as the number of datasets and the complexity of deep learning neural networks
    continue to grow (Wang et al., 2022b). Future works will have to deal with processing
    time to achieve real-time calculations effectively. Furthermore, adjusting and
    training neural networks is expected when the desired outcome is already known.
    Typically, neural networks are trained using a training data set whose exact target
    value is known. Then, trained neural networks can classify an unlabeled data collection,
    i.e., unknown target items such as grape clusters or winter grapevine buds. However,
    training the network is slow (around 700 min per model) (Bhatnagar et al., 2020)
    and requires high-skilled personnel expressly to guarantee ground-truth labelling,
    hence avoiding classification errors. Thus, to achieve the best integration of
    deep learning in precision viticulture, work on an interdisciplinary approach,
    to effectively bridge the gap between agricultural, information and technology,
    and other research scientists. In digital photogrammetry, the next step would
    be on-the-go image acquisition in complex scenarios such as vineyards to 3D modeling
    in real time to assess key parameters such as estimating yield prediction. However,
    it seems that artificial light is the best measuring environment at night. Nevertheless,
    machinery operating at night could be dangerous for operators (transit of people
    and machinery within the field crop) and less practical to carry out other tasks.
    In summary, with the development of new technologies, image processing methods
    have also advanced. Digital image and computer vision have progressed thanks to
    the availability of affordable digital cameras and the expansion in hard drive
    storage capabilities. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence,
    particularly ML through deep learning techniques, have strengthened proximal sensing
    in characterizing and identifying complex vine traits. Moreover, these methodologies
    can be transferred to other trellis-like systems, such as pears, apples, or almonds.
    7.2. Proximal sensing vs remote sensing This review has been primarily focused
    on ground-based approaches, yet precision viticulture typically employs three
    distinct types of platforms: fixed platforms, i.e., stationary systems, and mobile
    and aerial platforms. In this regard, the counterpart of proximal sensing is remote
    sensing, mainly through UAVs and satellites. However, satellite data, albeit most
    openly available, is still limited when revisiting times, restricting the possibility
    of acting on time. Nevertheless, they have excellent coverage, outdoing UAVs and
    ground-based systems performance, although the spatial resolution is unsatisfactory
    for precision agriculture (Jiang et al., 2020), hence precision viticulture. In
    addition, cloud cover and other atmospheric variables significantly affect satellite
    imagery (Tattaris et al., 2016), whereas UAVs usually capture higher spatial and
    temporal resolution images (Comba et al., 2020). Nonetheless, fewer spectral bands
    are provided than satellite imagery (Chen et al., 2019). However, satellites such
    as WorldView-3 launched in 2014, represent the first commercial ultra-high-resolution
    satellite (31 cm GSD resolution) and revisit frequency of less than one day (Satellite,
    2022), which would be crucial, for example to early detection of diseases or to
    assess the onset of ripening, i.e., veraison. Proximal sensing, in contrast to
    remote sensing, the ease of sensor attachment, virtually without limits on weight,
    for example, to a tractor while undertaking routine vineyard activities, is a
    critical time-saving advantage. Thus, ground-based sensing can be developed for
    agricultural machinery and equipment to assess a variety of critical crop growth
    risk variables related to vine abiotic or biotic constraints that affect yield.
    These can include crop stage assessment, soil conditions, and chemistry, weed
    concentrations, or insect presence, apart from vine sensing crop 2D and 3D geometry.
    However, due to the ongoing miniaturization of electronics, UAVs can be air-borne
    LiDAR (Guo et al., 2017), hyperspectral (Amanda et al., 2018), multispectral (Kerkech
    et al., 2020), thermal (Santesteban et al., 2017) and RGB (De Castro et al., 2018)
    platform, or also airborne-multiplatform (Soubry et al., 2017). Proximal sensing
    approaches are also suitable for both small and, to a fairly large degree, large-scale
    monitoring, the latter particularly suitable for vineyards rather than indoor
    research. In addition, the lack of constraints such as legislation, national rules,
    insurance or planning flying schedules makes proximal sensing approaches relatively
    more versatile. However, it is expected that regulation constraints might ease
    in the midterm. Speedy UAVs can be a fast and efficient alternative to assess
    large vineyard areas (Andújar et al., 2019), but specialized staff are required
    (Pádua et al., 2017, Pagliai et al., 2022). However, UAVs are not as limited as
    ground-based mobile platforms when moving on uneven terrain conditions or slopes,
    i.e., soil trafficability. Furthermore, UAVs allow easy access to difficult areas
    and avoid soil compaction (Torres-Sánchez et al., 2021). On the other hand, they
    are more sensitive to bad weather as well as encountering difficulties when using
    digital photogrammetric technics to 3D reconstruct non-textured areas due to lack
    of enough tie points (Pádua et al., 2017), proper distribution (Mousavi et al.,
    2021) and battery duration (Sassu et al., 2021).Furthermore, proximal sensing
    can acquire high-resolution images, providing a spatial resolution better than
    1 cm, appropriate for discriminating, for example, vine organs (Jones and Grant,
    2015). This is a challenging task for UAVs to achieve though the latest innovations
    allow the detection of fine details of plants (De Castro et al., 2021b). However,
    UAVs provide cost-effective data for vineyard mapping (Andújar et al., 2019, Comba
    et al., 2018) and can analyze hard-to-reach areas especially appropriate for mountainous
    vineyards. Unlike ground-based approaches, UAVs are more restricted by climatic
    conditions such as windy or rainy days, thus postponing the flight. Regarding
    photogrammetric techniques in woody crop scenarios such as vineyards, UAVs might
    represent a significant competitor to ground-based approaches in the future. Optimizing
    ultra-low altitude flights combined with nadir and oblique views are key to achieving
    even a sub-centimetre scale. Analogously, further research is required to find
    the optimal positions and sensor angle when attached to a ground-based mobile
    platform. The optimal angle can depend on the vine training method (thus the plant
    structure), leaf shape, and leaf location with respect to the ground. Therefore,
    these are the primary criteria that must be addressed while positioning and angling
    the sensor. Furthermore, in contrast to proximal sensing, UAVs flight altitude
    is a key parameter. Lower altitudes provide images with a better spatial resolution
    but need longer flights restricted by UAV battery capacity (typically ranging
    from 30 to 60 min). Furthermore, more computing time to process the images is
    required to produce accurate ortho-mosaicked images (Gómez-Candón et al., 2014).
    Hence, it is expected that these factors can help to widen the scope of UAVs-based
    imagery in precision viticulture: (i) achievement of higher levels of automation
    and performance of algorithms to extract and classify target information from
    dense 3D models, (ii) the increasing availability of free software as in (Torres-Sánchez
    et al., 2021) or less expensive commercial software (iii) battery lifespan and
    performance. On the other hand, it is envisaged that in the medium term, UAVs
    might bridge the gap between satellite imagery and ground-based sensing for high
    throughput phenotyping of vines. Although satellites are typified by low temporal
    and spatial resolution (unsuitable for most precision agriculture applications,
    thus precision viticulture), satellite imagery can be complemented with higher
    spatial and temporal resolution in combination with UAVs and ground-based measurements.
    However, derived information complexity grows as the vast amount of generated
    data has to be processed. Therefore, data processing tasks will need enhancements
    to the speed and robustness of algorithms to account for vine and field variability.
    Moreover, post-processing methods for deriving the intended phenotypic characteristics
    from SfM models still need refinement (Malambo et al., 2018). However, using digital
    photogrammetric methods from UAVs can provide a 3D point cloud comparable to LiDAR
    data acquisition (Goodbody et al., 2017, Wallace et al., 2016). The point density
    of a photogrammetric dense point cloud depends on the spatial resolution of the
    image and overlap level but is typically less expensive than a LiDAR point cloud
    (Di Gennaro and Matese, 2020). On the other hand, the average density of 3D point
    clouds in ground-based LiDAR systems is much denser than that of processed aerial
    3D point clouds (Pagliai et al., 2022). However, regarding vine canopy characterization,
    according to Campos et al. (2021) results (R2 over 0.84 for both TRV and LWA),
    which agree with Rajeev (2022), UAVs-based imagery has proved to be an effective
    alternative to estimate canopy parameters. These satisfactory outcomes allow the
    reliable generation of PPP prescription maps that can be adapted to VRA processes.
    Sensors such as LiDAR and ultrasonic mounted on ground-based platforms need to
    georeference, or scale acquired data using several approaches; integrating RTK-GPS
    (Cheraiet et al., 2021) and IMU (del-Campo-Sanchez et al., 2019) devices, fixed
    plane references and ensuring known constant speed (Palleja and Landers, 2017,
    Sanz et al., 2018). Similarly, UAVs also require a technique or approach to scale
    the model as in ground-based measurements, so georeferenced ground control points
    are needed. These are employed to transform the SfM image-space coordinates into
    the real-world, i.e., an absolute coordinate system (Westoby et al., 2012). Although
    in ground-based measurements through SfM-MVS, known references are also required
    in vines to scale the model as described in (Bou et al., 2019, Herrero-Huerta
    et al., 2015). Nonetheless, their operational costs are negligible compared to
    measuring ground control points employing RTK-GPS systems. On the other hand,
    it can also be necessary the assessment of different camera angles to improve
    the point cloud accuracy, i.e., nadir and oblique aerial images (recently developed
    in urban areas and forestry (Che et al., 2020) and flight altitudes (García-Fernández
    et al., 2021). Furthermore, the nominal flight altitude is a key parameter determining
    the ground sampling distance (GSD). Complex or rough topography, hence varying
    the distance between the UAV and the terrain, results in significant variations
    in GSD and nominal overlapping (Weiss and Baret, 2017). Nevertheless, UAV can
    perform very low-altitude flights to acquire high-resolution data (Pádua et al.,
    2018), comparable to ground-based SfM-MVS measurements. However, in (Torres-Sánchez
    et al., 2021), despite performing very low flights (10 and 15 m) and setting a
    view angle of 45, the presented methodology works correctly only in vines with
    two-sided leaf removal (to improve bunch detection). It is worth noting that although
    very-low flights allow subcentimeter-scale GSD, the sampled area is relatively
    smaller. Furthermore, the lower the flight, the higher the number of frames (Rajeev,
    2022), thus increasing computational time in the 3D modeling stage. UAVs-based
    imagery has also been tested to detect vine trunks from generating dense RGB point
    clouds using SfM technique with good robustness (Jurado et al., 2020). However,
    measurements of key metrics of trunks were not assessed. Furthermore, the proposed
    approach is more suitable when vines are defoliated hence not obstructing trunk
    detection. If the trunk is partly covered by foliage, the 3D reconstruction of
    the trunk can be obtained but with less resolution, thus leading to erroneous
    segmentation, resulting in false positives. LiDAR (Siebers et al., 2018), RGB-D
    based on ASV technology (Milella et al., 2019), and ground robots (Mendes et al.,
    2016) have been explored aboard mobile sensing platforms to detect trunks in vineyards.
    Nevertheless, these systems are not appropriate for screening large areas, being
    relatively more expensive and time-consuming, and always depend on sometimes harsh
    terrain conditions affecting trafficability, i.e., steep slopes or uneven surfaces.
    7.3. Proximal sensing mobile platforms in vineyards Precision viticulture relies
    on a variety of on-the-go sensors such as ultrasonic, LiDAR, RGB, and Depth-cameras
    to characterize vines geometrically. These sensors can be used statically or integrated
    into terrain moving platforms which is the most common option outdoors, i.e.,
    in real vineyards (see Fig. 6). Mobile sensing platforms enable real-time, on-site
    data acquisition and analysis and have shown great potential in facilitating precision
    viticulture. Furthermore, they can provide highly accurate and detailed data that
    would be difficult to obtain using traditional methods. Thus, they can reduce
    labour costs by automating data collection. Their design depends on the application
    scenario. Hence each platform has its advantages and limitations, so platform
    design should be combined with specific vine task requirements. Download : Download

    Hernandez-Lopez D. , 2019, Karp et al., 2017, Llorens et al., 2011a, Milella et
    al., 2019, Moreno et al., 2022, Rosell-Polo et al., 2017, Siebers et al., 2018).
    Fig. 1 shows some examples of mobile platforms mounting different sensors depending
    on the assessed vine traits. The most common option is tractor-based platforms
    that allow sensing the vines while performing other agricultural tasks, saving
    time and reducing fuel consumption. Their advantages also rely on using their
    flexibility to install and carry multiple sensors. Also, their low-cost since
    the farmer can use their own tractors in contrast to expensive robotic platforms
    that need to be developed specifically for the research project. However, soil
    compaction and mechanical crop damage can be some drawbacks. Many authors have
    used tractor-based platforms in vineyards, particularly attaching ultrasonic and
    LiDAR sensors (Colaço et al., 2018, Del-Moral-Martínez et al., 2016, Rosell and
    Sanz, 2012). However, when using ultrasonic sensors, these are installed in the
    sprayer machine (instead of directly on the tractor) at different heights to cover
    the vine canopy and adjust the spray rate (Llorens et al., 2011a, Palleja and
    Landers, 2017) or mounted on a frame attached to the tractor in the rear part
    (Mazzetto et al., 2010). The usual speeds are similar to those in LiDAR applications.
    Typical speeds range between 1 km/h (Sanz et al., 2018) to 5 km/h (Cheraiet et
    al., 2021, Llorens et al., 2011b). In depth sensing, tractors have been employed
    but in a caterpillar version for narrow rows (Milella et al., 2019). The AVS sensor
    was configured lateral and forward-looking to frame the canopy properly due to
    the limited vertical field of view of the ASV sensor and the row width. Although
    the rubber trucks width and length aid in lessening soil compaction, the camera
    sensitivity to motion-induced vibrations caused by the on-board combustion engine
    and the uneven terrain needs further improvements. Moreover, this tractor caterpillar
    is suitable for vineyard widths from 1.10 m to 1.50 m, depending on frame width
    and light (950 Kg). However, despite nimble manoeuvrability with very low soil
    compaction, using SLAM techniques may be advantageous and enable continuous estimation
    across succeeding crop rows. Therefore alleviating the challenges associated with
    the 180-degree steering phase at the end of each row. Concerning agricultural
    utility vehicles, these have been employed at 1.6–3.6 Km/h (Chakraborty et al.,
    2019) or up to 6 km/h (Lowe et al., 2020) mounting LiDAR sensors. These vehicles
    are reduced in size compared to tractors and have more effortless shifting, i.e.,
    the ability to creep along slowly to manoeuvre in tight spaces, which is essential
    in narrow spaces between rows and headers. These vehicles also have hauling, towing,
    and hill-climbing capabilities. All-terrain vehicles, i.e., 4WD cars, have also
    been employed in vineyards (del-Campo-Sanchez et al., 2019); however, their dimensions
    are not as suitable as utility vehicles, and soil compaction increases. According
    to micro-electric cars, several studies have been conducted through LIDAR and
    ToF depth sensors, such as Kinect v2 (Andújar et al., 2019, Moreno et al., 2022).
    This commercial plug-in vehicle is ultracompact, with a width of 1.19 m appropriate
    for narrow vine rows and an unladen weight of 450 kg. Since the speed of the mobile
    platform has a significant impact on data resolution, the ability of the electric
    motor to operate at very low speeds (below 3 km/h) results in negligible vibrations,
    which is essential for collecting high-quality data (Bengochea-Guevara et al.,
    2018). It also allows installation on a height-adjustable instrument boom attached
    to the front of the platform, other sensors such as the GPS antenna, or other
    complementary LiDARs. Moreover, its short length improves the dynamics of tractors
    in turning manoeuvres at the end of the vine rows. Some limitations are related
    to the reduced space in the rear part of the car to integrate the onboard computer
    and GNSS receiver. Nevertheless, the microcar is intended for urban environments
    (speed up to 80 km/h), so it is more convenient to be carried on another vehicle,
    i.e., a truck or van, to be transported to the experimental field. Other mobile
    platforms, such as electric-powered three-wheeled platforms made from lightweight
    structural aluminium, have been employed in vineyards using LiDAR systems. In
    this regard, Siebers et al. (2018) utilized a self-developed simple design but
    an easy-to-manoeuvre mobile platform with one free-pivoting wheel in the rear.
    It also permits operation in various row spacings (between 1.2 and 3 m) while
    maintaining maximum stability. Furthermore, this design is modulable, allowing
    the integration of more structural parts to add more auxiliary sensors such as
    GPS/IMU. However, further improvements can be related to its use in steep or uneven
    terrain. Moreover, the need to be carried on another vehicle to be transported
    to other areas is another issue to be addressed. Also, to develop the autonomous
    navigation of this mobile platform. 7.3.1. Phenomobile and robotic platforms for
    vine monitoring and management tasks The development of robotic platforms for
    precision agriculture has revolutionized the industry, allowing for improved crop
    yields, reduced labour costs, and increased efficiency. However, their transferability
    to complex, cluttered outdoor scenarios such as vineyards is still challenging.
    In this regard, there are three key issues to be addressed in order to deploy
    robotic platforms in vineyards: (i) how to increase or at least solve the prototype
    portability from laboratory environments to open field vineyards (ii) to improve
    the capacity to be steered across long distances (iii) Finally, teleoperation
    with a human-in-the-loop has to be intuitive, allowing for exploration of new
    and changing scenarios (Coad et al., 2020). Hence, these platforms can be equipped
    with advanced sensors and path-planning systems to perform autonomous monitoring,
    pruning, spraying, and harvesting tasks. These robotic platforms and robots in
    precision viticulture are still in the prototype phase. Yet, several projects
    are close to market, and others have already been released. Research groups have
    developed mobile phenomobile platforms to integrate optical and non-optical sensors
    and auxiliary devices such as RTK-GPS, IMUs, or dataloggers for vine monitoring
    and scouting. However, the most used sensors are RGB cameras (with other sensors
    such as NDVI ones), or ASV mounted on phenotyping vehicles. In this manner, grape
    bunches and berries can be detected and located through photogrammetric approaches
    and machine learning techniques to estimate yield potential and breeding. Regarding
    photogrammetry approaches, early steps through the so-called prototype-Image-Acquisition-System
    (PIAS) were made by (Herzog et al., 2014) toward a high-throughput phenotyping
    pipeline in vineyards. PIAS was later extended by (Kicherer et al., 2017b). The
    prototype captured images under natural illumination conditions with manually
    controlled exposure. PIAS is a four-wheeled handcart adapted to the vineyard row
    dimensions; the camera height above ground level can also be adjusted to standardize
    image acquisition. However, it must be dragged between grapevine rows (1 km/h).
    Also, when stopped in front of the target vine, the camera unit has to be triggered
    manually. However, the same research group developed the prototype Phenobot (Kicherer
    et al., 2015), later implemented by (Rose et al., 2016). In contrast to PIAS,
    Phenobot does operate autonomously and can acquire data automatically. This prototype
    enables sensing a more extensive set of vines more objectively. Phenobot is a
    track-driven vehicle that integrates a control unit and a camera-light unit (that
    is triggered automatically) to inspect grapevine traits. The Phenobot was designed
    to meet specific requirements to function in harsh outdoor conditions, such as
    the ability to lift 250 kg and have a low-vibration drive at speeds between 4
    and 6 km/h. However, the driving speed was set at 0.3 km/h in the field experiments.
    The platform has an adaptable sensor mounting system and a RTK-GPS-based navigation
    system for path planning. The camera unit is equipped with a lighting unit to
    acquire images at night to ensure uniform light conditions, and also it allows
    taking standardized images on sunny days. Variable lighting conditions are the
    most challenging issue in grapevine screening, especially on sunny days. Research
    studies have addressed this ever-present challenge using artificial light units
    (Kicherer et al., 2015, Nuske et al., 2014) or umbrellas to avoid overexposure
    and lessen projected shadows on the images (Bourgeon et al., 2016). Hence, Kicherer
    et al. (2017a) presented the Phenoliner, a modified grapevine harvester. Upon
    removing the harvesting equipment (which included the shaking unit and destemmer)
    a camera system with artificial lighting and a diffuse background was installed
    in a tunnel-shaped area. In order to cancel the sun influence, the tunnel base
    frame is extended, and a curtain is installed in the rear part to become fully
    independent from external lighting conditions. However, as in previous research
    studies, the vehicle travelled at 1 km/h or below, as the best combination of
    driving speed, frame rate, and storage capacity. Hence, although the aforementioned
    phenotyping platforms, i.e., PIAS, Phenobot, and Phenoliner, have paved the way
    in grapevine research, their speeds are too slow to reach the usual working speed
    of agricultural machinery (10 – 15 km/h) or provide low-resolution images. Therefore,
    to increase the efficiency of these platforms, Zheng et al. (2021) developed the
    Phenoliner v2 to improve the automated image acquisition in the field through
    further developments in the so-called tunnel designed by Kicherer et al. (2017a).
    The Phenoliner v2 speed was up to 6 km/h, much faster than the former Phenoliner
    setup (0.5 – 1 km/h). In future research, the authors proposed to install the
    sensor system of the Phenoliner v2 in front of a commercial harvester. Thus, through
    further developments, achieve sensing in real-time grapevine status while harvesting
    under unstable and strong sunlight conditions. In addition, stereophotogrammetry
    technology based on using digital RGB cameras has also been researched in robotic
    vine pruning since accurate 3D models are crucial for pruning tasks. However,
    the first attempts were performed under laboratory conditions. Botterill et al.
    (2013) employed trinocular stereo cameras were used to generate 3D models of vines,
    thus allowing the robot to determine which canes have to be pruned. Botterill
    et al. (2017) built a 3D computer vision system employing three RGB cameras (Point
    Grey Grasshopper2) using a triangulation-feature-matching algorithm and AI through
    SVM (Support Vector Machine) to decide which canes to prune. Vine models are built
    by matching image features, i.e., performing triangulation-feature-matching to
    3D model and then optimizing the model and the robot trajectory. Later on, in
    2021, also in real field conditions, Silwal et al. (2021) proposed a fully autonomous
    robot for end-to-end pruning of dormant season grapevines. The prototype was equipped
    with a novel perception and manipulation approach. In order to minimize abrupt
    lighting changes in the scene, the design used active lighting to maintain homogenous
    image exposure. Two stereo cameras were set to move along a liner slider to screen
    the canopy from multiple points of view properly, hence dealing with occluded
    parts. Thus, this multi-view approach (fourteen different viewpoints) allowed
    the generation of accurate and dense 3D models of complex vine structures to detect
    prospective cut-points, i.e., pruning locations. However, despite the presented
    works, in contrast to robotic harvesting, robotic pruning technology is still
    in its infancy and has attracted comparatively less attention (You et al., 2022).
    Regarding depth sensors mounted on robotic platforms, specifically SV and ASV,
    these have been explored in different applications. For example, Yin et al. (2021)
    attached an SV depth sensor to a harvesting robot to measure the pose of grape
    bunches for robotic picking in a vineyard. However, details on its functioning
    are not provided. On the other hand, a so-called Greenhouse Spraying Robot (GSR)
    mobile robot platform equipped with an ASV camera was used in (Kurtser et al.,
    2020a, Kurtser et al., 2020b) to detect grape clusters outdoors. The GSR platform
    is a skid steer robotic platform (with the front and back wheels on each side
    mechanically linked to turning simultaneously) designed for greenhouse spraying.
    The robot with a 160 kg payload that can travel up to 9 km/h was moved manually
    using an Xbox controller (although it can be programmed) parallel to the plants
    at 1.5 m to ensure the proper acquisition of AVS depth images. According to scouting
    and data collection, LiDAR systems characteristics have been exploited to 3D model
    vines along with other sensors such as thermal cameras, RADAR, RGB-D cameras,
    and stereovision-based sensors (Shamshiri et al., 2018). Since vineyards represent
    a complex and unstructured environment, one of the challenges of implementing
    robots in agriculture is to achieve robust navigation. In this regard, Nehme et
    al. (2021) presented a robust 3D LiDAR-based solution for structure tracking along
    vine rows, i.e., identifying the navigation clues such as estimating trunk position.
    This approach can be an alternative to RTK-GNSS since the navigation is provided
    by tracking geometric features in the top-viewed perceived scene, i.e., 3D LiDAR
    sensors mounted on top of the robot. Hence vine rows are scanned from the top,
    conforming to a profile structure that acts as tracking references. The presented
    technique does not require an initial field survey and is indifferent to crop
    features such as row width and spacing. Field trials demonstrated that the suggested
    approach delivers consistent and accurate row tracking, validated by trustworthy
    RTK-GNSS ground truth. Similarly, using a 2D LIDAR, Iberraken et al. (2022) proposed
    a four-wheel-steering mobile robot (which straddles the vine crop rows) to achieve
    autonomous navigation. The system allowed the detection of vine rows in 3D due
    to the motion of the robot, detecting the predicted structure shape in each laser
    scan and combining the images into a global map. Collecting points in 3D space
    during robot movement determined the subsequent trajectory. As aforementioned,
    the actual use of robots in precision viticulture is still in the early stages,
    but several projects are now in their final phases of development, and some have
    even been introduced to the market. Other Examples can be found in robot prototypes
    in EU-funded projects such as VINBOT (Guzman et al., 2016), GRAPE (Roure et al.,
    2018), BACCHUS (Lytridis et al., 2021) aimed at assessing the spatial variability,
    obtaining yield maps of vineyards and the latter to grape harvest. On the other
    hand, a robot prototype called VineGuard (Matese and Di Gennaro, 2015) developed
    at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) can undertake foliar applications
    as the more recent unmanned ground vehicle developed by (Robotics Plus) that can
    detect foliage and automatically adjust flow rate to guarantee spray effectiveness
    while minimizing inputs. In contrast, commercial solutions such as Vitirover (Frahi
    et al., 2021, Visconti et al., 2020) can cut the grass and weeds up to 2–3 cm
    from the trunk of the vine, while robots developed by (Wall-YE Software and Robots)
    and (Vision Robotics Corporation) can perform precision pruning. However, despite
    the rapid developments in robotics applied to vinerobots, research is still open
    to further improvements. These are related to limitations in power autonomy requirements,
    human-robot interfaces, safe coordination, and a lack of cooperation between multiple
    robots and humans (Lytridis et al., 2021). Fig. 7 shows examples of high-throughput

    range of sensing technologies for precision agriculture-based production of vines
    are discussed in this research. Due to the complex and unstructured nature of
    vineyards, the ideal sensor that fits in all situations does not exist. The election
    of the sensor has to be in accordance with the range depth to be measured, its
    built-in features, the in-situ crop geometry concerning the close surroundings,
    and the effect of ambient illumination. Therefore, sometimes different sensors
    and approaches must be combined to successfully address each site-specific agronomic
    goal. Although no sensor meets all the requirements, many vineyard applications
    exploiting LiDAR systems capabilities have been presented compared to other sensors.
    The primary benefit of LiDAR sensors over ultrasonic sensors (and also passive
    sensors) when collecting depth data is that its laser beam can trespass the vine
    canopy, providing information on canopy density and the interior geometry of vines.
    Ultrasonic sensors, despite being an active sensing technology, the higher divergence
    angle of the cone of waves results in a larger footprint compared to LiDAR sensors,
    hence the inability to sense the inner structures of vines. In contrast, ultrasonic
    sensors are easy to use and inexpensive at the cost of providing low spatial resolution
    data. On the other hand, thanks to the ever-growing family of depth cameras, most
    RGB-D cameras, 3D modelling has steadily developed in recent years due to companies
    such as Intel, Microsoft or ZED, with many researchers turning to the use of them.
    They offer three main functioning principles: structured light (SL), time-of-flight
    (ToF), stereo vision (SV), or active stereo vision (ASV) to estimate depth. Most
    of them provide colour information, are useful for image segmentation to detect
    grape clusters, and can acquire 3D information directly. In contrast, since LiDAR
    sensors are more independent of lighting conditions, measurements can be conducted
    for longer hours a day. Thus, larger vineyard areas can be assessed using MTLS
    approaches in exchange for requiring more data acquisition time than depth sensors.
    SL and ASV work according to the same triangulation approach, i.e., triangulating
    on visual features, which delivers a depth measurement with a quadratic increase
    in error; hence, their use is recommended for short-range applications. Compared
    to SL and ASV, ToF uses a direct depth measurement in which uncertainty scales
    linearly, thus more suitable for more extended-range applications (Giancola et
    al., 2018) as in vineyards. Typically, depth sensors provide data in the RGB colour
    space, useful for image segmentation to detect grape clusters, and the resolution
    is lower than that of LiDAR systems or stereo-photogrammetric methods. Although
    ToF performance is relatively more robust than SL or ASV under sunlight, stereo
    vision seems less sensitive. Each depth technology has its strengths and weaknesses
    in vineyard applications. Hence inherently leading to certain advantages and disadvantages,
    as detailed in this review, since their technical specifications vary considerably
    and even within the same technology (Giancola et al., 2018, Halmetschlager-Funek
    et al., 2019, Neupane et al., 2021). Due to their characteristics, they have been
    widely applied outdoors mainly to assess vine biomass and canopy structure, although
    their performance is reduced and sometimes cancelled under sunlight. Regarding
    digital photogrammetry, although image acquisition is fast, the performance of
    the feature detector algorithm is critical to identify invariant feature points
    in overlapping images which is challenging in real field experiments when vines
    are under varying lighting conditions. Moreover, the resolution of point clouds
    is highly dependent on the number of frames used for 3D computation, the number
    of distinct viewing angles at which the images were taken, and the resolution
    of the CCD sensor (Paulus, 2019). On the other hand, in SV previous camera calibration
    is not needed, nor is knowledge of its position or orientation required. Yet,
    capturing and processing many pictures entail significant restrictions in real-time
    applications (Gregorio and Llorens, 2021). Compared to SfM approaches, ToF sensors
    have a lower resolution within depth cameras. SL sensors are usually conceived
    within quality inspections (Han et al., 2020) and reverse engineering applications,
    providing high accuracy and resolution (Paulus, 2019). Unlike SL technology, digital
    photogrammetry has an advantage over SL since it automatically captures the surface''s
    unaltered shape, i.e., real appearance. However, a potential drawback in successful
    matching is contingent upon the sufficiency of details in the surface or lighting
    variations, as in the case of real conditions in vineyards. In addition, SL usage
    in sensing vine structures is mainly restricted to a lab or controlled environments
    rather than outdoors since it is heavily affected by strong lighting conditions
    than ToF and ASV sensors (Gené-Mola et al., 2020a). Although ToF cameras partly
    overcome this issue, the point cloud is sparser as light intensity increases.
    Other depth cameras based on SV and ASV are also used in precision viticulture,
    although to a lesser extent. It might seem that there is a pursuit for the most
    accurate, precise, and robust sensor to undertake the intended measurements in
    vineyards. However, despite the fact that sensor data with the highest spatial
    resolution provide more accurate estimations, sometimes, it may be impractical
    and useless to seek extremely high-resolution data for a specific agricultural
    application. This might be due to high expenses and data processing challenges.
    The proper sensor should be selected according to specific precision viticulture
    objectives; hence, selecting the proper approach for data assessment is also crucial
    since it directly influences the reliability and accuracy of the measurements.
    Furthermore, the adoption of precision viticulture necessitates adapting agronomic
    inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation to the individual demands
    of each vine. Hence, even though the ideal sensor for geometric characterization
    existed, developing an appropriate decision support system is still a bottleneck.
    This is paramount for complete agricultural management to maximize the yield of
    vineyards and the production quality within the 2030 European Green Deal strategy
    (Wrzaszcz and Prandecki, 2020). Finally, it is envisaged that future sensor systems
    will be more robust, less expensive, and more efficient in terms of speed of acquiring
    data and detection rate to meet the challenging vineyard conditions. State-of-the-art
    sensors and sensing platforms with improved uniformity of lighting conditions
    will allow for the collection of larger data sets and more accurate outcomes,
    in line with the general trend toward increased ease and speed in data acquisition.
    However, dealing with a steady increase of data generated from sensors, resulting
    in vast amounts of information being processed, might be a brake on developing
    precision viticulture approaches. Furthermore, the complex and ever-changing agricultural
    market to properly adjust decision support systems to the capacities of ground-based
    sensor systems in vineyards, requires potential improvements from the scientific
    body to overcome this challenge. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    In recent decades, the climate has changed considerably. There have been changes
    in temperature, rainfall patterns, and weather conditions, according to a number
    of recent surveys and research. By 2050, the global demand for crops is projected
    to rise from 60% to 110% of current levels. The effects of climate change on crop
    yield have already been seen in the majority of countries worldwide  [1]. Most
    countries globally have already witnessed the impact of climate change on crop
    yield. To reduce food security problems, It is crucial to identify the weather
    conditions that influence yields and to create plans for agriculture to adapt
    to climate change in order to lessen issues with food security  [2]. In today’s
    key agricultural regions of the world, crop production is severely hampered by
    escalating drought, climate change, and elevated temperatures. As a result, the
    difficulty of raising food yields to satisfy future demand can be overcome by
    accelerating the identification and adoption of techniques for coping with climate
    change [3]. Accurately identifying the climatic factors influencing agricultural
    output is a crucial first step in adjusting to climate change and reducing its
    impact on crop yield. One choice is, as previously noted, to change the sowing
    date. Precision farming is one of the sophisticated technologies that can be utilized
    to manage the dangers and hazards associated with food that result from population
    growth [4], [5]. Compared to other industries, the agriculture business lags behind
    in adopting new Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, despite the rise in fascinating
    research and innovative smart agriculture projects. The use of sensor technologies
    in farming is necessary to collect information on the soil, crops, various environmental
    factors, animal behavior, and tractor health. Sensor data can offer farmers useful
    information regarding weather conditions and forecasts, crop monitoring and production
    projections, as well as animal and plant disease detection [6], [7], [8]. For
    connecting wireless devices over a mesh network, Zigbee is the most widely used
    communication standard in the wireless sensor network (WSN) paradigm  [9], [10],
    [11]. Almost all crops suffer from pests, diseases, and insects that reduce yield.
    Pesticides and insecticides are not always practicable and can be hazardous to
    all birds and animals. Additionally, it impacts the food chain and the animal
    kingdom’s natural ecosystem [12]. Crop diseases considerably lower the yield.
    According to several academic works, insects, parasites, viruses, animals, and
    weeds reduce agricultural production yield by 20%–40% globally [13]. Furthermore,
    they raise numerous immediate and future concerns for food security worldwide  [14].
    A large amount of agricultural productivity is lost due to pests and diseases
    every year, particularly in the semi-arid conditions that prevail in India’s climate
    [15]. Temperature and humidity levels play a major role in the development of
    insects and the success of agricultural endeavors. Only after understanding this
    relationship, a prediction system can be developed that controls the growth of
    parasites [16]. Some analyses also suggest that temperature and rainfall are essential
    factors in insect growth [17]. Increased rainfall also helps spread plant diseases.
    Monitoring weather factors such as rainfall, humidity, and condensation is therefore
    critical to avoiding pest outbreaks and reducing the frequency of insecticide
    and fungicide application. Pest occurrence in crops is also strongly related to
    the soil environment and soil management  [18]. In this proposed work, a system
    is designed that maximizes yield by finding the higher growth windows for Rice
    and Sugarcane crops and finds poor breeding conditions of pests attacking these
    crops. There are two contributions to the proposal. First, we set up a network
    of wireless IoT sensors to collect agricultural field data. Second, we identify
    the most appropriate planting window with the highest yield and the lowest incidence
    of pest invasion. An IoT crop monitoring network is to be deployed, which is used
    to capture regular samples of climate characteristics and generate crop cycle
    data sets [19], [20], [21]. Also, the collected meteorological data were used
    as training data by the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to improve the
    rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction systems. Also, the collected meteorological
    data were used as training data by the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
    to improve the rule base of fuzzy logic-based prediction systems. Barometric pressure,
    daily temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation are all measured and included
    in the collected data. The information is gathered by the sensor node, then transmitted
    to the base station in a manner that supports multi-hop communication, and finally,
    it is stored in the cloud. The data that is kept in the cloud has already been
    predefined in order to account for inputs that may fluctuate owing to low battery
    voltage or sensor calibration issues. The analysis of conditioned data allows
    for the capture of the correlations between the temperature, humidity, and precipitation
    that are necessary for the breeding of a specific insect. For the proposed fuzzy
    system, the Cauchy membership function is used. The attributes are subdivided
    and assigned five linguistics variables, i.e., (VLOW) is assigned to very low,
    for low, (LOW) is assigned, (MODRT) is assigned to moderate, (HIGH) and (VHIGH)
    to high, and very-high, respectively. The variance, width, and the center of each
    linguistic variable are calculated and is coded as a chromosome for processing
    in the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). The novelty of the proposed
    work is summarized as follows: • Deployment of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless IoT enabled
    sensor network monitoring infrastructure in medium grass vegetation. • Implementation
    of multi-objective optimized fuzzy inference system, that identifies the most
    suitable planting window with the highest yield and the lowest incidence of pest
    invasion. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the
    related work in the literature. The discussion on deployed IoT monitoring infrastructure
    and its network parameter is done in Section 3. The modeling of the Fuzzy inference
    system and multi-objective declaration is presented in Section 4. The result analysis
    and validation are discussed in Section 5 and finally, work is concluded in Section
    6. 2. Related literature The Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics (DA)
    are getting serious attention as potential solutions to the problem of how to
    feed the globe in the next years [22]. There were an estimated 30 million installations
    of IoT devices in agriculture in 2015; experts anticipate that number will more
    than double by 2020, reaching 75 million. It is anticipated that the utilization
    of IoT and DA would make smart agriculture possible, which will then give high
    operational efficiency as well as high production [23], [24], [25]. Wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) have been used for smart farming and food production for a variety
    of applications, including environmental monitoring, precision farming, automation
    of machine and process management, and product tracking and tracing [26], [27],
    [28]. Self-organizing, self-configuring, self-diagnosing, and self-healing make
    WSN ideal for smart agriculture and the food sector. The wireless sensor network
    (WSN) is an integrated system that includes RF transceivers, sensors, microcontrollers,
    and power supplies [29]. However, because to the rapid development of IoT, a paradigm
    change has occurred, moving away from the utilization of WSN for smart agriculture
    and toward IoT as the primary driver of smart agriculture. The Internet of Things
    is an integration of many currently existing technologies, such as wireless sensor
    networks (WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID), cloud computing, middleware
    systems, and end-user applications [30], [31]. Improved agricultural output, product
    quality, and financial returns are all possible thanks to the Internet of Things
    (IoT) because of the decision tools and automation technologies it makes possible
    to apply across a wide range of agricultural contexts. It is possible to estimate
    agricultural output with the use of data such as rainfall, leaf area index, leaf
    moisture content, and soil parameters [32], [33]. The Internet of Things has found
    a number of uses in the agricultural sector. Crop and livestock monitoring [34],
    [35], machinery [36], irrigation and water quality monitoring [37], weather monitoring
    [38], soil monitoring [39], disease and pest control [40], automation and precision
    [41] , to name a few. In agriculture, accurate data analysis is crucial for enhancing
    production and efficiency. The requirements of various Internet of Things applications
    have led to the division of data analytics into several categories [42]. Massive
    analytics, memory analytics, business intelligence analytics, and real-time analytics
    are all part of this category [43]. The data comprise of sensor data, audio, pictures,
    and video. Disease identification in leaves, stems, and fruit quality [44], weed
    detection and irrigation [45], and many more applications have all made substantial
    use of image processing in agriculture. Recently, farmers have been using image
    processing with the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve yields and decrease crop
    failure. Drones will be used to take periodic aerial photographs, and Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices will be used to monitor the weather and other environmental
    conditions [46]. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have
    led many researchers to apply predictive models to solve problems in different
    disciplines in real-time [47]. Researchers use machine learning in agriculture
    to study seed varieties, plant physical types [48], weed classification [49],
    [50], pest classification [51], crop disease control [52], etc. All crops require
    special climatic conditions for ideal growth and higher produce. Various work
    in the literature has been conducted to determine the effective sowing periods
    according to different climatic conditions [53]. Many studies have used agro-ecological
    models to determine climatic fluctuations and their effects on crop production.
    The model uses different types of data related to soil, climate, and crops [54],
    [55], [56]. Pests and their diseases are the determinants of yield quantity and
    quality of crops. The main pests of Sugarcane prevalent in Indian Territory are
    Sugarcane stem borer, Green bug, Chinch bug, and Pink stem borer [57]. Rice cultivars
    are affected by leaf folder, brown plant hopper, yellow stem borer, gall midge,
    and gundhi bug [58]. The development of these pests in plants is correlated to
    the traits and anatomy of the crop; thus, they are related to management practices
    primarily associated with climatic characteristics, which particularly raise fluctuations.
    Recent work in precision agriculture is using deep learning techniques to develop
    models for real-time monitoring of insect development in the field [59], [60].
    Zhang et al. (2017) proposed a comparative study of various machine learning models
    to find pest occurrence regions [61]. Machine learning is useful for data analytics
    to generate automated predictive models [5], [62]. The field of computer science
    deals with pattern recognition using the computer learning theory of artificial
    intelligence. One can derive the most important insights from the big data collected
    in the data analytics and machine learning field. It reveals hidden relationships
    between parameters that affect agriculture, such as temperature, soil salinity,
    and humidity. The most popular and relevant machine learning techniques for predicting
    pests and diseases of crops by analyzing the weather data include artificial neural
    networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and fuzzy
    logic. For example, the author proposed a machine learning system based on SVM
    to classify two diseases of apple trees. The leaf images were used as the input
    to train the model [63]. K-Nearest Neighbor is used for the detection of anthracnose
    rots [64]. Similarly, the multi-layer perceptron is used for the prediction of
    Verticillium fungus in the farmlands of the United States [65]. However, there
    are no bibliographic studies on disease prediction algorithms in the Indian region.
    Latest advancements in computer vision and image processing have enabled a comprehensive
    analysis of crop-related properties, providing scientific assessments and increasing
    productivity. For example, CNN was used to classify images of wheat spikelets
    and spikes accurately and to track the location of wheat spikelets and spikes
    correctly [66]. Similarly, image processing techniques were employed to enumerate
    the spikelets of wheat crops and concluded that the leaves and spikelets of the
    crop differ in texture and color. Therefore, he used the law of energy texture
    as a specific property for forming the neural network model. A deep convolutional
    neural network was used to detect the number and width of stems in sorghum crops
    since this attribute is used to estimate the annual yields of most crops [67].
    Fuzzy systems help to solve many decision-making problems in agriculture and often
    provide the best input-based decisions and knowledge-based rules. Fuzzy systems
    are a division of intelligent systems that facilitate the widespread use of human
    expertise to detect insufficient structural problems and handle insufficient incomplete
    data. Fuzzy systems are intelligent systems that apply information and inference
    processes to address critical problems. For example, fuzzy logic has been used
    for sustainable node deployment in the farmland for crop monitoring [68]. A prototype
    that used artificial intelligence and machine learning to assess the severity
    of diseases in rice cultivation has been developed [69]. In this work, the authors
    used the K means and fuzzy logic to calculate the extent of disease in rice. Their
    model showed 86% accurate results [69]. In another work, fuzzy logic to get the
    best crop model in agriculture. The results showed that the model needs to be
    modified, and the proposed ecological model is used to maximize crop productivity
    [70]. However, most of the work are using image processing. Despite huge advantages,
    IoT also has limitations. There is a wide variety of sensor types, each with its
    own communication interface and incompatible communication protocols, which leads
    to a high software and hardware footprint and challenges in future growth. Embedded
    gateway middle-ware is essential to the IoT, although its study and implementation
    are still in their infancy. The majority of research on monitoring and perception
    of agricultural IoT is concentrated on data collecting and processing by a single
    equipment; however, there is a dearth of studies on full application systems.
    Research and implementation of IoT-enabled intelligent farm equipment have mostly
    centered on improving the performance of isolated technologies. When it comes
    to transferring large amounts of data, agricultural IOT depends heavily on the
    availability of a fast wireless-WAN. High-speed data transfer is not practical
    given the poor wireless connection signal present in the isolated agricultural
    area. As a result, the only thing we can do to guarantee the system’s ability
    to function effectively in real-time is to increase the data coding efficiency.
    The proposed work focus on the deployment of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless IoT enabled
    sensor network monitoring infrastructure in medium grass vegetation. The data
    collection is done in the real-time and can be scaled to similar medium grass
    vegetation. 3. Network setup The aim of this work is to implement a low-power
    IEEE 802.15.4 CC2538-2592 SoC microcontroller to establish a sensor node network.
    Table 1 shows the parameters related to monitoring infrastructure. The target
    areas were rice paddy and sugarcane fields in the outdoor experiment. Images of
    sensor nodes installed in bare land, rice, and sugarcane fields are shown in Fig.

    functions as a weather station is depicted in Fig. 2. Gateway’s edge computing
    platform is built on top of a Raspberry Pi 4 and a CC2650 MCU. For the purpose
    of transferring gathered data to a distant server, a Virtual Network Connection

    has a reception sensitivity of −97 dBm for Bluetooth low energy and −100 dBm for
    IEEE 802.15.4. The transceiver is wired to an omnidirectional antenna with a 5
    dB gain (ANT-24G-905-SMA), and it is set to produce 7 dB of power. A multi-probe
    capacitive soil moisture sensor based on a fringing field is linked to a node
    MCU. The experimental performance evaluation shows the low power consumption and
    high processing power. The sensor node processing unit is designed with a 2.4
    GHz Arm Cortex-M3 32-bit multi-protocol wireless MCU and is equipped with three
    LG CS318650 lithium-ion cells (3.6 V, 2200 mAh) connected in parallel [71]. A
    node is equipped with a capacitive soil moisture sensor, photo-resistor, and a
    TMP36 multi-probe temperature sensor in the area. The node is surrounded by a
    PLA enclosure and placed on a PVC conduit above the ground to protect the node
    from environmental hazards. The physical layer of the Contiki 3.0 implementation
    of RTOS uses DSSS-OQPSK (Direct Sequence Spectrum Shift Orthophasic Phase Shift
    Keying) modulation. A data rate of 250 kbps is maintained and a bit error rate
    of 2% is used for all measurements. Each byte is divided into two 4-bit symbols.
    Each symbol is assigned to 16 pseudo-random sequences, and each sequence has 32
    elements. The chip sequence is sent at 2 Mchips/s, with each symbol’s least significant
    chip (C0) sent first. 4. Proposed methodology The main goal of precision farming
    system modeling is to understand how to tune the model to handle the type of data
    set in question. Agricultural datasets contain the massive amount of uncertainties
    that are very fluctuating in nature and are correlated to other parameters, making
    it difficult to determine a system capable of resolving these uncertainties [72].
    Research and experimentation have shown that fuzzy logic models can deal with
    fluctuation associated with environmental and agricultural data sets. Fuzzy logic
    and fuzzy set theory work similar to human understanding and, due to this ability,
    are used to solve the inaccuracy, uncertainties, and subjectiveness associated
    with application-based models and are used in various decision support systems
    [73]. Fig. 3 illustrates the proposed model. The weather parameters chosen for
    the modeling of the proposed system are soil temperature (STem), daily temperature
    (ATem), relative humidity (RHum), and rainfall (Rain). These parameters are chosen
    based on the literature reviews suggesting the apparent correlation between weather,
    crop growth, and pest breeding conditions [17], [74]. Table 2, Table 3 shows the
    weather conditions for pest and crop growth. Once the attributes are given as
    input to the fuzzy inference system, each attribute are further divided into five
    linguistic variables. Based on the expert opinion rule base and the knowledge
    base of the fuzzy inference system is designed. The rule base is optimized using
    the NSGA2. The model outputs the cropping window which has a higher crop growth
    rate and minimum pest growing probability. Download : Download high-res image

    November early 4.1. Fuzzy inference system preparation The initial step is to
    normalize the dataset to the range [0,10]. (1) After normalization, using Eq.
    (1), the assignment of the Linguistic Variables (LV) is done for each attribute
    . Each parameter is sub-categorized into five linguistic variables using the Cauchy
    membership function. In the model training step, all possible combinations of
    features are taken as input and are used to generate a crisp output. The training
    data is then transmitted to the FIS (Fuzzy inference system). The fuzzy inference
    system’s membership distribution, knowledge base, and rule base are initialized
    using the data collected through the deployed IoT infrastructure. To each linguistic
    variable a fuzzy set is associated. These values are calculated using the membership
    function distribution with a constraint that there must be one maximum value equal
    to 1 associated with each linguistic terms. Table 4 shows the attribute name and
    the associated linguistic variable. Table 4. Linguistic variables assigned to
    attributes. Input attributes A Linguistic variable Rainfall Atmospheric temperature
    Soil temperature Relative/absolute humidity 4.1.1. Formation of membership function
    The Mamdani linguistic fuzzy inference system (MFIS) was used to identify the
    suitable growing season and predict the spread of pest infestations on crops.
    describes the behavior of the system based on explicit rules made up of linguistic
    variables (LVs) that assume the values of a series of words with real meaning.
    MFIS modeling includes rule-based design, database design, and Defuzzyfication
    type design. The proposed entry in MFIS is a dataset . The dataset includes input
    parameters like daily temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, soil temperature,
    and planting time of the crop in a particular month of the year i.e.,  . The is
    the minimum and is the maximum value for attribute , and are the upper and lower
    limits of the attribute range shown in Table 2, i.e.,  . The rule base of a fuzzy
    inference system consists of a large number of fuzzy rules, where, is the set
    of all possible MFIs rules. Furthermore, for a particular set of attributes as
    input, the number of fuzzy rules is limited by the and values i.e.,  . Fuzzy rules
    are associated with a set of fuzzy inputs for element and a set of fuzzy outputs
    for elements. For the proposed model, the input set consists of temperature, humidity,
    precipitation, soil temperature, and outputs are identified i.e., suitable planting
    windows and the possibility of insect infestation. Therefore, and , respectively.
    The CMF value of the attributes is shown in Table 5. The relationship between
    and is represented by a membership function , where, . The membership function
    database is created using the Cauchy function and is given as follows: (2) where,
    , , and , are the center, half-width, and slope at the crossover point of the
    membership function. The CMF values for input attributes are presented in Table
    5. The structure of the rule base is given as follows: (3) Table 5. CMF values

    7.577 5.880 4.1.2. Design of knowledge base is a set of rules for a fuzzy classifier
    associated with the following assumptions. First, at least one fuzzy rule must
    exist for each output class i.e.,  . Second, the number of fuzzy rules in any
    set must be between a minimum and maximum value i.e.  and . To every fuzzy set
    there is an integer value associated, which is generated from the hierarchical
    output set and normalized attribute set . To obtain accurate results, the defuzzification
    method (CoG/CoA) is used. The resulting contiguous membership function identifies
    and aggregates centroids from all subareas to obtain a fuzzy output. 4.1.3. Calculation
    of firing degree The degree of activation, usually referred to as firing degree
    of the rule associated with the input data is the degree of persistence of the
    if part of the fuzzy rule, expressed by and determined using Eq. (4). (4) Hence,
    the degree of activation equals to the t-norm operation done on complete dataset
    and the fuzzy set generated from . The summation of all the firing degree of all
    the rules with a restriction that the output is equal to , the equation for calculation
    of the degree of association between input dataset and output set can be given
    as; (5) 4.1.4. Calculating degree of classification The degree of classification
    accuracy of the classifier is represented by the . If the degree of association
    is highest, the classification is considered more accurate, that is; (6) 4.2.
    NSGA-II based multi-objective model formulation The objective for formulation
    of proposed multi-objective model is to accurately identify extensive fuzzy system
    for identification of ideal crop plantation time and low pest breeding time identification.

    Objective 1: Objective 2: Constraints Constraint 1: Constraint 2: Constraint 3:
    . Range condition Condition 1: Condition 2: 4.2.1. Objectives declaration The
    proposed system is a two-objective model with three range conditions and three
    constraints as represented in Table 6. The first objective is to identify the
    suitable window for sowing of the crop such that the harvest is highest and is
    calculated from Eq. (7). (7) where, represents the attribute and represents the
    mean value of the attribute. Since the growth of the crop is dependent on the
    weather parameter, the inverse of the difference of and gives the better growing
    window for the crop. Next, a maximization function is applied on the equation
    to find the maximum yield. The second objective is to find the time slot of the
    year in which pest breeding probability is low. This is calculated using the following
    equation. (8) 4.2.2. Constraints identification The model is build with three
    constraints, namely constraint 1, constraint 2, and constraint 3. Constraint 1
    ensures in each fuzzy set the number of rules lie within the defined range, i.e.,  .
    Constraint 2 reduces the equivalences between fuzzy sets. (9) (10) The duplicate
    values or quantities within a fuzzy set are represented by the equivalence function
    and checked by calculating overlapping input variables between two fuzzy variables,
    which must not be greater than , i.e.,  . is set to 0.005 to ensure minimal overlap
    in the proposed model. This means that only 5% of overlapping is the maximum allowed.
    Constraint 3 ensures the number of distinct fuzzy rule within a set must be less
    than the pre-ordained value i.e.,  . is calculated by following equation. (11)
    where, denotes the shortest distance between the centers of two different fuzzy
    sets. 4.2.3. Selection of multi-objectives To each individual chromosome in the
    population set, for every input attribute , a variable number of fuzzy rules are
    associated. The connected fuzzy set is represented using real numbers and are
    the center and variance, respectively. For this, and are chosen for model interpretation,
    such that at least 48% of any fuzzy set will be within the variable. The value
    of and is tweaked manually for individual attributes. The operation is performed
    to avoid the convergence of the optimization operation to a local optima. Two
    discrete parameters and , where, , respectively are associated with each individual
    to perform crossover and mutation. 4.2.4. Initial population generation and chromosome
    representation For maintaining the diversity within the initial population, all
    chromosomes are distributed equally so that the rules associated with it lie between
    the minimum and maximum values, with a constraint of association of at least one
    rule with each individual. The next is the encoding of all the linguistic variables
    in the form of the chromosome. The five linguistic variables, i.e., very low,
    low, medium, high, and very high, are represented by the first 15 bits of the
    chromosome. The number of bit allocations is determined by Real-Value Encoding
    with Binary Code (REBC). The output is the slots that has maximum growth probability
    and minimum pest breeding conditions. The initial chromosomes represent a possible
    solution and are part of the initial population . The chromosomes values are derived
    based on the phenotype and in the proposed model. the phenotype is rainfall, humidity,
    soil temperature, temperature, slots number and breeding probability. The phenotype
    is mapped to genotype using REBC encoding. The phenotype-genotype relation is
    shown in Table 7. Genomes are the binary string and with the help of REBC reverse
    mapping, these are converted to the real values. Since weather related attributes
    are further divided into five linguistic variables, and each linguistic variable
    is represented using 3 bits. Based on the bits assigned to linguistic variable,
    number of slots given and the breeding probability, the total bits required to
    represents the fuzzy rule is and for output it becomes . For encoding and decoding
    of the chromosomes Eqs. (12), (13) are used. (12) (13) The initial population
    is generated using Continuous Uniform probabilistic Distribution, based on Eq.
    (14). (14) where and are the upper and lower bounds. Table 7. Chromosome encoding

    and mutation Crossover combines two chromosomes to produce a new chromosome that
    acquires the characteristics of the original chromosome. The probability of a
    roulette wheel is used to select a parent from the initial population. The adopted
    approach to parental choice improves the adaptation of solutions based on the
    quality of the physical situation. Random crossing point selection identifies
    breakpoints in two parents, then selects half of each parent to produce new offspring.
    The mutation is done by doing a little flip operation. This approach reverses
    every bit of a chromosome with a given probability of changing a particular chromosome.
    4.2.6. Fitness value evaluation A chromosome’s fitness is identified based on
    the results produced by a particular fuzzy system implementation. The chromosome
    obtained after each generation is compared in terms of the fitness function. The
    fitness value is the average of all the test cases applied on the chromosome obtained.
    For the proposed model, the fitness is determined by fitting the chromosome obtained
    in the two defined objective functions. As the result of the proposed model is
    a prediction for a particular scenario, so the comparison result is 1 for correct
    recommendations and 0 for incorrect recommendations. This is presented as follows:
    (15) 5. Experimentation and result analysis The experiment is conducted in the
    farmlands situated in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. For the sugarcane dataset collection,
    the sensor nodes were developed in a 7.53 × 104 m area. The data collection started
    with the planting of the crop on November 10, 2019, till June 20, 2020. For rice,
    the nodes were deployed in the farm area of 8.04 × 104 m , and the data collection
    was done from July 13, 2019, till November 18, 2019. For both crops, the readings
    were collected at the interval every 30 min. The rice dataset has 1 lakh number
    of rows and is of 46.46 MB in size. The sugarcane dataset has 1.78 lakh number
    of rows and is 164.64 MB of data. Most of the data attributes are numeric in type.
    For the model preparation, 80% of the entire dataset was used for training and
    20% was used for testing. The condition for the crop growth and the pest occurrence
    is evaluated based on linguistic variables. Fig. 4, Fig. 5 represents the growth
    rates at different time period. The growth of rice can be observed between 26/07/2020
    and 21/08/2020. Similarly, for sugarcane, time after 28/12/2019 and before 13/04/2020
    is suitable. Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9 describes the growth pattern of the pest in the
    crops selected for study. From Fig. 6, the pest occurrence with high probability
    in the rice crop is observed during the period between 15/07/2020 to 25/07/2020,
    which further decreases. Again, the suitable humidity for high pest growth is
    observed between 21/08/2020 to 11/09/2020, which again becomes moderate. A certain
    low growth rate is observed during 27/08/2020, which gradually increases till
    18/10/2020. After this time gradual decrease in pest occurrence can be noticed.
    Fig. 7 demonstrates the lower pest probability that occurred during the time period
    between 25/07/2020 to 05/08/2020, which remains moderate till 23/09/2020 with
    certain deep observed after this date till 10/10/2020. Another slot with low pest
    occurrence is from 03/11/2020 to 15/11/2020. For the sugarcane crop, the high
    pest occurrence can be observed after 18/01/2020 and before 29/04/2020 from Fig.

    supporting the high growth can be observed after 24/03/2020 and becomes moderate
    after 03/04/2020, and certain low breeding is observed after 16/05/2020. The cross-validation
    process is complex than that of a simple classification system because the set
    of cross-validation solutions is larger. The result of the optimization is a set
    of non-dominated solutions, each with a different number of rules. The -fold cross-validation
    ( 10) method is presented in this section for multi-objective classification problems.
    This process requires data partitions as input. The data is split into smaller
    sections for cross-validation. Any data other than the data used for training
    is passed in each iteration. The non-dominated solutions are the output of the
    MOEA algorithm in each set. Using various functions, the classification rate of
    the algorithm, as well as its sensitivity and specificity, are calculated for
    each non-dominated solution obtained using the data for validation. The obtained
    output is represented for each rule number in the range by calculating the average
    of the classification rate of the solution obtained. The average specificity and
    sensitivity are then calculated using the same method. A comprehensive performance
    comparison of the proposed model, FNSGA, with traditional methods is done. The
    proposed method is first of the kind as per the best knowledge of the authors
    hence traditional algorithms were implemented for the comparison. The models like
    ANN, Bayes Net, SVM, Random Forest, and MRM were used for model comparison and
    evaluation. For the implementation of the algorithms Spark analytic Engine is
    used. A spark 2.0 version was used to make a cluster of 3 PC with specification
    Intel(R) Xeon scalable processor E-2124G with CPU@3.40 GHz. The reason for comparing
    the proposed model with all the above mentioned models is because these models
    are popular machine learning algorithms and perform well on the real time collected
    datasets. All the algorithms taken for study were implemented using Pyspark. The
    training and runtime of each algorithm is presented in Table 8. For Bayes net
    the train time was and run time was , where c is the number for the class. The
    time complexity and run time complexity for ANN with four layers with a, b, c,
    and d number of nodes, and n epochs was . The time complexity of the proposed
    model is O(f(n)), where n is size of dataset and f(n) is the fuzzy logic function.
    Fig. 10 compares the True Positives Rate, and it can be seen that the proposed
    models have the highest True Positives Rate when compared to other models. The
    FP rate of the proposed model is minimum compared to the other models as shown
    in Fig. 11. As shown in Fig. 12, the F-Measure is also close to 1. The Matthews
    correlation coefficient (MCC) is generally used for comparing the prediction quality
    in any classification problem, as shown in Fig. 13. Although other models achieved
    near-96 percent accuracy, the overall performance of the FNSGA model is more effective
    than other algorithms; also, the Area under the ROC curve shows better results
    for the complex and unbalanced dataset. When the AUC values of different machine
    learning models are compared, the proposed model has the most optimized AUC value,
    as shown in Fig. 14. In Fig. 15, the accuracy of models is compared, and it can
    be seen that SVM and ANN achieved similar accuracy while MRM performed better
    than these two models. The proposed model, on the other hand, achieved an accuracy
    of 98.21 percent. Download : Download high-res image (214KB) Download : Download

    Fuzzy inference system that finds out a suitable time for crop plantation such
    that the pest occurrence is also low. Hence, it helps increase crop yield and
    lowers the use of pesticides. The farmland selected for data acquisition is situated
    in the Gwalior district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The region has hot and dry summers
    and very cold and dry winters. The irrigation is mainly monsoon-dependent. The
    weather condition in the region supports the growth of pests in sugarcane and
    rice crops. The model predicts the slots suitable for maximizing crop production
    and shows the probability of pest occurrence during the selected slots. The model
    uses the correlation between the weather conditions and the crop physiological
    and analogical traits to find the cropping time. Likewise, it also finds the correlation
    between the pest growth rate in terms of weather conditions to find out the most
    favorable breeding condition. Finally, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
    evaluates the optimum slot with a high growth rate of plant and low pest growth.
    The current work is done for the medium grass vegetation for humid subtropical
    region. The proposed mechanism will work on any vegetation under this category.
    Further, in our future works we intend to conduct study for small and large grass
    vegetation. Also, focus will be on developing a recommendation system that will
    help farmers find suitable pesticides and suggest the correct amount of pesticides
    be applied on the field. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

    farming 1. Introduction Technological advancements have revolutionized almost
    all sectors, particularly agriculture, in the modern world. Likewise, the agricultural
    sector, which is a very risk-averse [1], has also been transforming over time,
    and is aiming at producing more yield and better quality food by establishing
    and maintaining better crops. In order to diversify and improve the natural population
    of crops and to enhance the genetic variability, techniques such as mutagenesis,
    traditional breeding, gene editing, and marker-assisted breeding has been under
    practice for years [2]. However, climate change has impacted the agriculture sector
    [3], whereas adaptations to climate change and advances in agricultural-related
    aspects, such as optimal natural resources usage and limiting the deteriorating
    environmental impacts altogether, have given the farming sector a new face and
    dimension. Efficiency of the agriculture sector is threatened due to world population
    pressure on global production systems, changing climate [4], and crops or food
    losses due to mishandling [5]. According to the United Nations prediction about
    the increase in population, a world population of 9.8 billion is expected by the
    year 2050, and this number may hit 11.2 billion after 70–80 years [6]. Keeping
    these stats in mind, food production must be increased up to 50% to meet the food
    demand of this increasing population and ensure food security. Smart farming,
    often known as smart agriculture, is a farming practice that uses sustainable
    methods to meet the population’s growing food needs while minimizing negative
    effects. The global community has embraced it and is supporting it. The fundamental
    tenet of this strategy is to effectively utilize the resources at hand for sustainable
    output while lowering the expenses of all activities associated with the agricultural
    industry [7]. Smart agriculture represents the use of technologies such as sensors;
    the internet of things (IoT) [8], which is a network of computing devices; artificial
    intelligence; and robotics [9] to assist traditional agriculture and convert it
    into a smart and sustainable agriculture [10]. In fact, the IoT is the combination
    of modern technologies that has the potential to provide modern solutions to agricultural
    problems [8]. Additionally, with the help of data mining technologies [11], a
    large number of datasets, either agronomical [12], genomics [13], or meteorological
    [14], are partitioned into useful information to make easy and efficient decision
    making [15] in order to make farming activities more precise and efficient. Climatic-
    or soil-related data in smart agriculture and farming is obtained using sensors
    [16], and then automatic processing of this big data is carried out with the help
    of modern methods and analysis tools, such as machine learning [17], spike and
    slab regression analysis, and time-series analysis [18]. This process gives the
    obtained data an easy, understandable, and knowledgeable form, which then warns
    the farmers about any upcoming climatic events, i.e., droughts or heavy rains,
    chances of insect or pest infestation, and the spread of infectious disease (i.e.,
    fungal diseases) [19]. Following the warning alerts, this IoT based agriculture
    system blended with ecological sensing and assisted with image processing techniques
    [20] helps farmers in adopting precautionary measures and in customizing the planning
    of crop management practices, i.e., irrigation, fertilization, and pest management,
    with the help of modern digital and internet-assisted tools and smart applications
    as presented in the Figure 1. Figure 1. An architecture of smart farming components:
    Monitoring to end use applications. The internet of things provides efficient
    ways to assist the farmers and researchers in the agricultural crop production
    sector. Moreover, it assists the decision making by making various information
    readily available when it comes to soil [16], water [21], pesticides [22], fertilizers
    [23], and manures [24]. Climate change and global warming are the burning issues
    of the world, with a lot of studies and resources being spent to ensure a better
    future for the coming generations. With the IoT availability [13], increased benefits
    [25,26] can be made available for this cause by concentrating on the sustainability
    of the resources and by protecting the earth with wise decision making [20]. Additionally,
    the IoT can help agriculturists and farmers to not only grow the crops smartly,
    but to effectively deal the post-harvesting and the end consumer’s deals on the
    agricultural products [27]. In addition to this, IoT effectively contributes to
    precision farming with technologies including drones for agriculture [28], remote
    sensing [29], smart greenhouses [30], smart livestock management [31], computer
    imaging [32], and efficient climate monitoring [33] as indicated in the Figure
    2. Data mining and simulation modeling of various crops [12], environmental situations,
    and their management [34] are receiving a lot of attention. Researchers are developing
    new algorithms to ensure more vigorous and detailed information [35] for better
    and improved decision making. These techniques have also been used in fertilizer
    application suggestions [36], i.e., timing and rate of applications, disease,
    yield predictions [37,38], soil moisture detection, and in scheduling irrigation
    [39]. Keeping in view the importance of smart techniques, the objectives of the
    study were to summarize the latest applications of smart techniques, including
    (i) yield estimation, (ii) irrigation and fertilizer management, and (iv) insect,
    pest, and disease monitoring and management in crop production, particularly under
    changing climate. Schematic diagrams and figures created and used in this review

    (https://www.canva.com/en_gb/, accessed on 24 June 2022). Figure 2. An exemplary
    hub of IoT based smart farming applications in smart agriculture. 2. Climate Change
    and Its Effects on Various Crops: A Need of Smart Crop Production Climate change
    has severely impacted agriculture worldwide [40]. Rising temperature, fluctuations
    during day and night temperature, and seasonal variability in the rainfalls has
    increased the intensity of extreme weather events, i.e., droughts, flash floods
    [40,41,42,43], and incidence of disease occurrence have increased [44]. Efficiency
    of production systems has been affected, and the impact of climate change has
    triggered the need for and the adoption of climate-smart adaptation options to
    sustain productivity and availability throughout the year. Such adaptation options
    and technologies need to be adopted in almost all aspects related to agricultural
    crop production, such as soil–water dynamics, nutrients, and fertilizers [41,45]
    management, improvements in crop types and evaluations [46], applications of beneficial
    elements [47], organic amendments in soil [48], fisheries, livestock, and poultry,
    and farm mechanization, as indicated in Figure 3. Temperature is one of the critical
    factors in crop production. Figure 3. Climatic impacts on agriculture and adaptation
    technologies to combat climate change. Numerous studies have been carried out
    regarding temperature and its effect on various vegetative and reproductive phases
    in crops [49,50]. A productivity decline has been observed in various crops, such
    as peaches and plums, which refers to a change in the temperature pattern of a
    low chilling zone [51]. Moreover, a shift has been observed due to an increase
    in temperature in the choices of different varieties in bananas, grapes, and other
    horticultural crops, which ultimately yield a better product to this changing
    climate. A periodic change in climate is inducing a significant impact on the
    production of certain spices such as cardamom and black pepper [52]. Biomass production
    and total yield of potato has been affected by the elevated temperature, and an
    effective decrease in gross photosynthesis has been noticed [53]. Despite increased
    biomass production, a 14% decrease in seed yield has been observed by Ruiz-Vera
    et al. [54] while growing maize at an elevated temperature of 25.4 ± 1.6 °C. Tip
    burn and leaf desiccation have been noticed in San Joaquin, Imperial, and Salinas
    Valley in the United States due to higher temperatures in lettuce, which eventually
    affected its growth and maturation [55]. Specific ranges of temperature are finalized
    for the effect of temperature on crop growth and productivity. However, an increase
    in temperature results bolting in cole crops, which is not a desirable attribute
    while growing it for vegetable purpose [56]. The temperature range 25–35 °C is
    considered as the moderate range for most crops, where they show the best thriving
    and productive attributes [41,57]. However, the temperature below the moderate
    range is the temperature where the growth is slow and unsteady. According to Ounlert
    and Sadoode [58] and Ounlert et al. [59], the temperature of 38–40 °C is quite
    high for most crops and their optimum production. Likewise, temperatures below
    5 °C is where there is no production of fruit at all for different agronomic and
    horticultural crops, i.e., mangosteen. If the temperature exceeds 42 °C and 45
    °C, it causes the suppression in the germination of cucumber and melon seeds,
    respectively, while the same trend has been observed at 42 °C in watermelon, summer
    squash, winter squash, and pumpkin seeds [60]. Dry periods are very important
    for fruit trees such as mangosteen to stimulate flowering, and various studies
    have observed the same trend. It is reported that a dry period of 15–20 days is
    required to induce the flowering in the mangosteen [61]. Moreover, it has been
    observed that, in case of mangosteen, flowering increased as the drought period
    before the flowering increased. Delayed curd initiation has been recorded in cauliflower
    when the daily temperature exceeded 30 °C [62]. Uneven head in broccoli and reduced
    tomato sizes were reported when the temperature increased above 25 °C for certain
    period, the traits of which are not very much liked by the end consumers. Rai
    et al. [63] reported that insufficient chilling is responsible for lowering fruit
    texture and taste, while high temperature and moisture stress bring cracking in
    fruit trees such as apple and apricot. Summarizing the various symptoms such as
    bud drop, abnormal flower development, poor pollen production, dehiscence, and,
    ultimately, yield losses has been reported by Hazra et al. [64] due to an increase
    in the temperature for tomato. Climate change, variability, and its impact have
    some serious impacts on all the agricultural commodities. There is a change in
    phenology of crops and horticultural fruit trees with the observed changes in
    the rainfall pattern. Changes in rainfall and temperature affects the flowering
    dates of fruit trees [59]. Research had been carried out to investigate the minimum
    and maximum rainfall and its impact on crop production. If the rainfall received
    by the mangosteen is >2500 mm, then there is no need to irrigate it manually,
    while the range of 1270–2500 mm needs a checked irrigation to keep mangosteen
    hydrated and fit for growth and flowering [65]. Rainfall below the 1270 mm ultimately
    limits the growth and overall fruit and flower production. Humidity, like rainfall,
    plays a vital role in ensuring the best thriving fruit in mangosteen production,
    and it has been suggested that the humidity level of 75–80% is optimum for the
    mangosteen [65]. Optimum soil moisture levels should be maintained to keep the
    enough water available for the roots to absorb and transport it to the whole tree.
    Various management levels are required to meet the effective requirements of the
    crops, even within an irrigated area. Soil moisture, irrigation, and rainfall
    are the pivotal entities to fulfill the net water requirements of a crop [66].
    Based on water deficit analysis, Li et al. [66] suggested that rainfall, coupled
    with irrigation, proved an increased yield of sorghum, corn, and soybean in the
    Jilin region of China. In addition, rainfall is an indicator of the crop water
    requirement as well as an indicator of the irrigation requirement for all these
    crops. To measure the glucosinolates contents in variety of vegetables, such as
    cauliflower, cabbage, kale, reddish, turnips, and brussels sprouts, it has been
    found that climatic factors, including the varying rainfall, influence the accumulation
    of these secondary metabolites in vegetables. However, AZM et al. [67] reported
    that both soil and environmental factors are going to impact the production of
    winter vegetables. The rainfall patterns of 2000–2001 and 2002–2003 was the deciding
    factor for the reduction in the fresh pod weight of okra in the inland valley,
    and it played a significant role in pest development, disease onset, and in soil
    chemistry [68]. There is always a negative reaction of crops towards climate change,
    but vegetables are generally more prone to its adverse conditions [69]. Furthermore,
    climate change is also responsible for bringing strong winds, storms, hurricanes,
    and tornadoes to various parts of the world that are the foregrounds of agricultural
    productivities. When faced by these strong winds, the branches of trees and crops
    are prone to damage. Leaf tearing of broad leaves has also been observed in various
    crops, while difficulty in carrying out agricultural operations demands increased
    investment in agriculture. Keeping in view the climate change aspects, it becomes
    important to adopt modern techniques and methodologies to sustain the efficiency
    of farming systems, which ultimately leads to stable crop productivity under diverse
    environmental conditions and contributes to food security. 3. Yield Prediction
    in Smart Agriculture Crop yield is an important entity, and yield prediction is
    a salient and challenging task in agriculture. Soil properties, meteorological
    data and seasonal fluctuations, seed quality, harvesting methods, monitoring of
    pests and diseases, managing nutrient deficiencies, and maintaining water requirements
    for the crops are all contributing factors for predicting the overall yield of
    a plant or crop. Precision agriculture has been used for years and now researchers
    are considering the use of variable rate technologies [70], sensor monitoring
    [16], and management systems to ensure better crop health [27], improved productivity
    [28], and better quality [71] of the produce. Sensor- and drone-assisted quality
    monitoring of horticultural crops [21], yield predicting sensors [72] on harvesters
    of various agronomic crops [73] (Figure 4), and use of the internet and real time
    data simulators [74] are receiving attention day by day, particularly for their
    use in large scale crop production. Figure 4. Sensors- and drones-assisted quality
    monitoring of horticultural crops and yield prediction during harvesting of crops.
    Simulation models have been introduced for yield simulations which are assisting
    in understanding the behaviors of varying yield in relation to fluctuating environment,
    nutrient, water, pest, diseases, and other field conditions [38,75,76]. The CROPGRO
    model [77] was especially designed for simulating different grain legume crops
    such as soybean, groundnut, and common dry bean crops. In an experiment for predicting
    the yield of tomatoes in glasshouse, Qaddoum et al. [78] used an EFuNN (Evolving
    Fuzzy Neural Network) model which predicted fluctuations in the weekly yield of
    tomato with an average accuracy of 90%. Cropping system models, such as APSIM
    and ARMOSA, consider the soil physical and chemical conditions (i.e., water dynamics,
    nutrient cycling) and perform accurate predictions of products such as grain,
    biomass, or sugar yield in response to climate and management conditions [79,80].
    These insights make the model a pivotal choice for the farmer’s adaptation to
    the external changes, and allow simulations to understand the farmer’s response
    to varying seasons and climate changes [81,82]. The Erosion Policy Integrated
    Climate (EPIC), currently known as Environmental Policy Inte-Climate, model is
    another comprehensive model which is under continuous improvements and has the
    capacity to simulate crop growth, heat and water balance, wind and water erosion,
    and nutrient cycling [83]. This model helps in understanding the soil dynamics
    and their relationship to crop management while keeping the soil erosion details
    in consideration. Various environmental components are considered, and their impact
    on crop production have been evaluated using modern techniques. For example, soybean
    productivity was observed, and the influence of relative humidity, evapotranspiration,
    temperature, and precipitation over it was predicted by Veenadhari et al. [84].
    Using ID3 algorithm, Veenadhari et al. [84] reported that humidity has the most
    prominent effect on yield, followed by temperature and precipitation. In another
    study, temperature and humidity sensors were used to suggest the appropriate crop
    and to carry out an effective irrigation control. Moreover, climatic parameters
    such as soil temperature, air temperature, and humidity were also considered.
    Varman et al. [85] discussed, in their research work, various machine learning
    models, such as Feed Forward Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and
    GRU, and concluded that LSTM was the most fit model for his research, in which
    they calibrated and proposed the best suitable crop for the next rotation. Sugarcane
    yield was forecasted by Suresh and Krishna Priya [86] after developing a statistical
    method for predicting the considerable amount of yield. Data in this research,
    which included temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall, was collected from
    weather stations. Conclusions of the model were entirely dependent on the condition
    of how precisely the input data was incorporated into model. Interestingly, the
    sugarcane yield was estimated successfully prior to the harvest. Soil moisture
    prediction in Cojocna was carried out by Matei et al. [39], using nine algorithms,
    namely: KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Rule Induction, Decision
    Tree, Fast Large Margin, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The accuracy of
    the results was high, and the findings assisted the farmers to decide and opt
    for the appropriate steps, which helped them to avoid future crop damage. Machine
    learning methods (RF, SVM, NN) and the regression method LASSO (Least Absolute
    Shrinkage and Selection Operator) were used to predict wheat yield based on the
    data obtained from satellite and climatic data by Cai et al. [87] in their research
    work. Additionally, data mining provides a way to analyze nonlinear relationships
    and capture complicated biological processes that underlie plant responses to
    stimuli, both of which are difficult to perform using simple statistics such as
    ANOVA and linear regression. Exploratory data analysis was performed before using
    the abovementioned machine learning methods, and it was concluded that the best
    performance was shown by integrating climate and satellite data. Blagojevic et
    al. [88] studied apricot in a research work where PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act)
    method was employed for predicting the yield. An Artificial Neural Network, as
    a machine learning method, was used for the abovementioned predictions that took
    as input: shoot length, fruit weight, shoot thickness, amount of fertilizer, and
    beginning of the harvest. A web application was developed considering the ease
    of displaying the predictions for the yield as a result output. Ravichandran and
    Koteeshwari [89] proposed a prediction system constructed on the ANN (Artificial
    Neural Network). Various parameters were determined by using this approach, namely
    pH, phosphate, potassium, nitrogen, depth, temperature, and precipitation, and
    the output was the adapted culture. This system appeared to be helpful in determining
    the productivity status for the crop. It assisted the farmers to select the best
    and most suitable crop for their land and gave options for the selection of mandatory
    fertilizers. The system manifested 92% accuracy in achieving the forementioned
    objectives. In another study carried out by Cillis et al. [90], several interactions
    were discussed (Table 1). The research work considered the interaction between
    soil–genotype, genotype–climate, climate, and management practices. The findings
    of the study comprehended the organic carbon storage of the soil and specifically
    monitored greenhouse gases emissions. Moreover, in order to determine the nutritional
    requirement of strawberries species, MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines)
    has been successfully employed, which has aided in predicting the shoot quality
    as well as determining the leaf color responses of strawberries towards tissue
    culture nutrients [91]. In a similar study, minor nutrient requirements were assessed
    by using regression trees, and it was found that CART (Classification and Regression
    Tree) analysis was the better indicator of the nutrient requirements, such as
    B, Mo, Zn, and CU levels, for a better growth response in hazelnut [92]. The regression
    tree approach is exceptional at handling missing values and outliers. Additionally,
    crop yields were observed by noticing the management approaches and their long-term
    effects. Using the regression analysis approach, it confirmed the diminishing
    of soil organic carbon losses by practicing conservation tillage systems under
    actual climatic conditions. Table 1. Yield prediction and climatic impression
    on overall yields of crops using smart agricultural data mining techniques. 4.
    Smart Irrigation Techniques The water cycle has been substantially altered by
    climate change, which has also increased the severity of droughts [93]. Hence,
    efficient water use in agricultural systems is a basic concern in the current
    scenario. The losses of water under limited water availability have gained a lot
    of interest in these days, when a major part of the world is susceptible to drought
    each year. Traditional and manual irrigation systems fail to accomplish water-saving
    goals, and are unable to supply water efficiently [22]. Smart irrigation is a
    technique which is countering this problem efficiently by not just providing efficient
    water use, but also saving it for the future [94]. Additionally, smart irrigation
    reduces the input costs, which provides relief to the farmers [95]. Manual irrigation
    requires manpower for daily observations and scheduling irrigations by observing
    plants or crops in fields, but a sensor-assisted irrigation system detects soil
    moisture available in the soil profile and initiates the irrigation, making irrigation
    control better than the manual [96], whereas a decision-support-system-assisted
    irrigation system integrates soil moisture sensors and climate sensors to observe
    water demand and control irrigation application for crops (Figure 5). The development
    of accurate and effective irrigation systems has been aided by the revolution
    in decision-support-assisted irrigation systems, brought about by advancements
    in technology [97]. This not only incorporated soil moisture and climate sensors,
    but also an internet-assisted cloud system for real-time data observation. Dynamic
    simulation models are linked to examine the effects of irrigation on crop growth
    and productivity estimation. Moreover, in accordance with data analysis and yield
    predictions, an irrigation quantity has been finalized and is supplied through
    an automatic irrigation control system. A remote control or mobile application
    [98] is also linked up with this system for easy understanding and usage of the
    modern irrigation hub. A scheme of an advanced irrigation hub is presented as
    of Figure 6. Figure 5. Manual versus smart-sensor-based and decision-support-system-assisted
    irrigation applications. Figure 6. Advanced irrigation hub assisted with real
    time weather and moisture sensors and decision support systems. Smart irrigation
    consists of various steps and schemes, which are illustrated in Figure 7, which,
    in combination, make this technique a revolution in agricultural production systems.
    Various techniques were developed and utilized to achieve efficient irrigation
    goals in smart agriculture systems. Automatic drip, sprinkler, real-time moisture-sensor-assisted,
    and predictive irrigation schemes are commonly being utilized [99]. Various advanced
    irrigation techniques haven been developed and improved with time, and some of
    those are indicated in Table 2 with their methods of data usage and objectives.
    Padalalu et al. [37] presented a control system for an automatic irrigation, aiming
    to record and control the irrigation needs of the crop. Several variables, such
    as humidity, soil temperature, and pH, were observed by installing sensors. Additionally,
    a Naive Bayes algorithm was applied to estimate the exact water demand of the
    crop. Weather forecasts were observed to monitor the quantity of applied water
    to crops and the model of this intelligent irrigation system assured the intuitive
    use of water. An irrigation system based on the Support Vector Regression method
    was developed and proposed by Xie et al. [100]. The system was composed of an
    irrigation demand estimation component to evaluate the energy and time needed
    for carrying out the subsequent operations. It was also composed of a solar energy
    prediction component for forecasting the solar energy. Figure 7. Flow diagram
    of various components and processes of smart irrigation systems. Numerical Weather
    Prediction (NWP) and the Time of Use price model (TOU) were employed, which exhibited
    clearly that the water resources and the amount of energy can be saved was up
    to 7.97%. Following the forementioned findings, costs declined by an estimated
    25.34% when subjected to a comparison with the soil-moisture-based irrigation
    system. To maximize crop yields and to conserve an excess of water, Goumopoulos
    et al. [101] devised a decision support system based on a Wireless Sensor/Actuator
    Network (WSAN). The system was positioned to observe irrigation in a greenhouse.
    Real-time monitoring for precision irrigation was provided by the developed system
    in it. Various sensors were considered, such as soil moisture sensors, humidity
    sensors, and temperature sensors, in strawberry field. The results from this research
    depicted a 20% decreased water consumption as compared to a traditional irrigation
    system. In another study, Zhang et al. [102] performed experiments in the laboratory
    and in the greenhouses. A Fuzzy Logic-based irrigation control system was developed,
    and information was gathered from soil moisture sensors to decide the irrigation
    application time. The system came out to be a successful one in tackling the uncontrolled
    lengthy irrigation schedules. Peng et al. [103] developed an irrigation system
    using WSN and Fuzzy Logic to save water. The system was composed of four parts:
    the cluster of sensor nodes, coordinator nodes, two variables as inputs (soil
    moisture error and the rate of change of the error), which provided watering time
    as an output. An irrigation controller was also used for automatic watering and
    monitoring of the pipe network, which eventually helped in precise and quick calculation
    of amount of water required in irrigation. An automatic irrigation system was
    developed by Anand and Perinbam [104] that consisted of four different parts.
    The first part was sensor nodes, which were collecting the temperature and moisture
    readings. The coordinator node, as a second part, the irrigation controller, as
    a third one, which was based on Fuzzy Logic to monitor the watering and the time
    of its application, and the irrigation pipe network, as the last component of
    their proposed system. The Fuzzy Logic-based controller was accounting for numerous
    activities in the automatic irrigation system. One such use was monitoring the
    water level in the tank. Likewise, it was also responsible for examining the amount
    of rain, the atmospheric temperature, and the wind speed. All the information
    which was under investigation, whether the field condition or the system itself,
    was collected and made available for the farmer through the GSM Module [105].
    The Fuzzy Inference System, another smart irrigation system for monitoring the
    evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation, was developed by Mousa et al. [106]. Goals
    were accomplished by using the specific algorithms such as the estimation of ET,
    soil moisture observations, required irrigation’s estimation as per reference
    ET (ET0), monitoring irrigation schedule, and the time of irrigation. Drip and
    sprinkler irrigation systems can be linked and applied successfully using this
    system. Moreover, results indicated the fuzzy model as an intelligent and quick
    implementation for recording the evapotranspiration and water needs of the crop
    field. Table 2. Techniques to achieve efficient irrigation goals in smart agriculture
    systems. 5. Smart Monitoring of Insects and Pests In modern agriculture production
    systems, modern techniques are being utilized for smart monitoring and control
    of insects and pests. To spot six parasites in an apple orchard, Boniecki et al.
    [107] suggested a neural classifier. The names of the parasites were apple blossom
    weevil, apple clearwing, codling moth, apple leaf sucker, apple aphid, and apple
    moth. The abovementioned classifier was established on 23 parameters, which included
    form and color characteristics. The former was 7 and latter was 16 in number.
    Decisive results were obtained by considering the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural
    Network topology in the peach orchard. Rodrigues et al. [108] used an extension
    of Fuzzy Logic, named Interval Fuzzy Logic, to predict the appearance of the parasites.
    Data was captured using temperature and humidity sensors, and processed by Interval
    Fuzzy Logic, which ultimately provided the warning levels. Different hardware
    components, such as the Arduino platform and different sensors, were used to develop
    this system. A demonstration of a drone-assisted evaluation of insects and pests
    in enabling the timely implementation of actions to remove the high-risk infestations
    is presented in Figure 8. In addition, AgroDSS for agriculture, a new decision
    support system, was developed to learn the pest population by Rupnik et al. [109].
    This system relied on data mining approaches, and the implemented tools used were
    supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and time series analysis. The data
    was gathered by Trap View and allowed an efficient pest observation by using insect
    traps in the vineyards and orchard. When it came to deal with the missing data,
    linear regression was used by Da Silva et al. [110], who also applied logistic
    regression while inspecting the results obtained from the land and the monthly
    surface temperature. They calculated “accumulated degree-day” by using a meteorological
    satellite to reduce disease risks by mapping the pests. A significant relationship
    was observed between the accumulated meteorological stations values and satellite
    values. Figure 8. Evaluation of pests and encountering remedies in smart farming.
    The crops lines algorithm, in association with the Convolutional Neural Network,
    was proposed by Bah et al. [111]. The aim was to pin down weeds in various crops,
    such as beet, spinach, and bean fields. The research work was also assisted by
    the drone images, which were taken about 20 m height. The best accuracy in results
    were achieved in beet field. However, the research work also mentioned a few hardships
    concerning the right detection of the weeds. This usually happened when the plants
    were at early growth stage or when there was a less distance between weeds and
    crop. Various techniques for smart pest monitoring and its related goals are described
    in Table 3. For an early alert and recommending necessary control measures, Tripathy
    et al. [112] presented a real-time Decision Support System. The main objective
    was observing and predicting the pest and disease status in the field. Furthermore,
    numerous DM techniques have been used in groundnut crops, which were based on
    some climatic and weather parameters. The experiment was using the Naive Bayes
    method with Gaussian distribution. Rapid Association Rule Mining, in conjunction
    with the aforementioned technique, was performed to search out the multiple weather
    correlations with other related parameters. Doses of pesticides are an important
    indicator for the betterment of the crop, and they were predicted by Viani et
    al. [113] by using Fuzzy Logic. Weather data (soil temperature and moisture) were
    considered, and the risk of infection was counted by examining developmental stages
    of the plant and the fluctuating environmental conditions. By combining hydroponics
    with IoT, Alipio et al. [114] developed an efficient hydroponic system, which
    assisted in providing the right nutrient’s type and amount at the best suitable
    time. A Bayesian Network (BN) prediction algorithm was implemented to obtain the
    maximum of the right decisions to control the system. The three main components
    of the developed system were a data analysis module, a web interface, and sensors.
    The sensors used were controlling the electrical conductivity, managing pH, monitoring
    light intensity, recording humidity, and water temperature. For displaying the
    data and to control the system, there were two operational websites for this purpose.
    A clear increase in the yield obtained with the automatic control was observed
    as compared to the manual control system. Table 3. Techniques and goals for monitoring
    pests and input management in smart agriculture. 6. Smart Disease Management Diseases
    in crops are devastating in terms of yield and deteriorating the quality of the
    produce. Numerous solutions are out there in the market and industries [115,116],
    yet there is a need to think or perform smarter, to remove the excessive damage
    to the final product, and to enhance the outcome in terms of the revenue. In smart
    agriculture, the focus is on the classification of the diseases and its detection
    precisely at any stage [117], so that smart decision making can be conducted and
    the excessive failure in the yield and quality can be avoided. A modified model
    image of smart disease management using normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI), drone, and imaging techniques is presented in Figure 9. Singh et al. [118]
    opted for the image processing technique using a genetic algorithm. In his research
    work, he observed and managed several leaf diseases on various crops, achieving
    the precision percentage of 88.99%. Likewise, 89.56% precision was achieved by
    Warne and Ganorkar [119] while detecting the leaf diseases in cotton crop. They
    classified the diseases as red leaf spot and Alternaria leaf spot of cotton using
    a neural network algorithm. Similar research was performed by Revathi and Hemalatha
    [120] while working on a cotton crop. Image processing was assisted by the neural
    network to detect and classify cotton diseases. In this research work, they classified
    Fusarium wilt and leaf blight with the high precision of 98.1%. Image processing
    by employing Support Vector Machine was performed by Bhange and Hingoliwala [121],
    Yao et al. [122], Jian and Wei [123], and Dubey and Jalal [124] to target teyla
    in pomegranate, rice blast and rice sheath blight in rice, downy mildew and brown
    spot in cucumber, and apple rot, scab, and blotch in apple. The results from these
    research studies have indicated the precision percentages as high as 82%, 97.2%,
    94% and 93%, respectively, as represented in Table 4. Figure 9. Smart disease
    management by using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), drone and imaging
    techniques. Modified figure where the drone mapping image on the top right was
    obtained from: https://www.futurefarming.com/tech-in-focus/pain-points-of-nitrogen-applications-how-drone-data-helps/,
    accessed on 14 June 2022. Table 4. Methods and precision percentage for detecting
    and classifying diseases in smart agriculture. 7. Smart Indoor Farming/Vertical
    Farming The amount of agricultural land has decreased as a result of the persistent
    trends of population growth, urbanization, water supply reduction, and ongoing
    climate change [125]. Numerous variables, including the rise in food prices, social
    tensions and land disputes, the severity of persevering climate change, and increased
    urbanization, contribute to the absence of effective planning for food security
    and sustainability. Contrary to old farming systems, a controlled, automated vertical
    farming model was introduced, which is an indoor based farm model constituting
    of an automatic air, temperature, and humidity control, solar panel lighting and
    heating, tunable 24 h LED illumination, and creative uses of recycled water supplemented
    by rainwater or water from a desalination facility [126]. The impacts of seasonality
    can be reduced or completely eliminated when performed in conjunction with temperature
    and humidity control. Two categories of this farming system have been used: those
    where the crop is produced on a vertical surface, and those that have several
    tiers of conventional horizontal growth platforms [127]. Leafy vegetables such
    as lettuce, peppers, tomatoes, and herbs have all been cultivated extensively
    in horizontal systems, which are sometimes stacked on top of one another to form
    vertical farms. These horizontal and stacked horizontal agricultural technologies
    make use of numerous glasshouses and plant factories [128]. Occasionally, for
    personal production, the use of balconies as an alternative to indoor horizontal
    farming has also been proven as an effective urban horticultural practice. For
    vertical farming, green walls [129] and cylindrical growth units [130] have been
    in practice, the former operated in facades of the buildings, while in the latter
    one, plants are connected with a nutrient medium source and are grown one above
    another. These farming systems are often assisted by an artificial lighting system
    to meet the adequate requirement of photosynthetic active radiation for a better
    growth and yield [131]. The carotenoids accumulation has been known to be increased
    by 15% in Brassica rapa under a blue and white LED recipe compared to only white
    LED [132]. Red LEDs alone are responsible for enhancing biomass accumulation,
    green LEDs for carbon assimilation, and blue LEDs are mainly helpful in photosynthetic
    processes in plants [133]. All these available LEDs not only provide better growth
    and development, but also cheaper and more reliable artificial lighting options
    compared to the high-pressure sodium (HPS), fluorescent tubes, and metal halides
    (MH) lights. 8. Major Obstacles for Implementation of IoT and Smart Techniques
    Smart farming and IoT are considered as a blessing to the agricultural sector,
    yet it brought a series of various challenges to agriculturists, and farmers in
    particular [134,135]. If not overcome or addressed timely, those hurdles can reduce
    the feasibility and effectivity of this technology. Over time, numerous constraints
    have been reported [103,136] and efforts are being made to resolve the limitations
    [137,138]. Among the major problems to be remitted, one is the security of the
    big data [139,140,141]. IoT devices accumulate huge data from an agricultural
    IoT system, which can be viewed by an unauthorized access due to the paucity of
    the necessary security protocols by some of the IoT providers [142,143]. Hence,
    the data may suffer manipulation or other ownership problems. Another big problem
    is the lack of infrastructure for this technology. Infrastructure concerning internet
    access and remote field locations are the main issues for farmers who, even after
    adopting this technology, cannot achieve the maximum output. High costs of IoT
    systems are another hurdle which is being addressed by making available less costly
    wireless sensors in the market [144]. Still, a lot is in needed to minimize the
    costs of the whole system [145], after which one can expect that farmers will
    switch to IoT and smart farming. Moreover, the majority of the farmers in various
    parts of the world are uneducated [146]. Smart farming and IoT demands a fair
    amount of knowledge to deal with the sensors, internet cloud, and end user applications
    [147]. Additionally, various countries pose a series of regulations and paperwork
    for the farmers who are willing to adopt new technologies. These tiresome regulations
    are another factor which is keeping farmers away from it. For example, there are
    numerous no fly zones for the drones in the agricultural fields near to airports,
    military zones, and other government properties [148,149]. Hence drone mapping
    is not feasible for those fields and farmers. Meanwhile, agricultural digitalization
    is engulfing a huge employment opportunity for the laborers and other farming-related
    professionals. On one hand, it is better for reducing the labor input and cost
    for the owner, but on the other hand, is depriving local workers of multiple job
    opportunities [150]. Keeping these constraints in mind, there arises an important
    question: Will this technology thrive more in the coming years? 9. Conclusions
    and Future Guidelines The study provided a summary of the inventive strategies
    created and applied to combat the effects of climate change and maintaining a
    sustainable crop output. The recent smart strategies for various crop management
    approaches, as well as the technologies associated with yield predictions and
    enhancements, are explained. It has been shown that implementation of smart techniques
    and IoT is necessary to boost the productivity of crop production systems. It
    was found that various neural networks and simulation models could aid in yield
    prediction for better decision support, with an average simulation accuracy up
    to 92%. Numerous techniques have been presented for yield forecasting, pest management,
    smart irrigation, and disease classification and detection for efficient monitoring
    of crop health and water status. Different numerical models and smart irrigation
    tools help to save energy use by reducing it up to 8%, whereas advanced irrigation
    reduced the cost by 25.34% as compared to soil moisture-based irrigation system.
    Yield prediction under different predicted climatic conditions not only help to
    modify ongoing irrigation and fertilizer management practices, but ultimately
    lead to resource use efficiency and profitable agricultural productivity. Smart
    and precision disease management is an effective approach to control diseases
    and sustain yields. Several leaf diseases on various crops can be managed by using
    image processing techniques, such as by using a genetic algorithm with 90% precision
    accuracy. While aiding image processing techniques by neural networks, diseases
    can be detected and classified, and the research achieved precision up to 98%
    in detecting and classifying diseases in different crops. Vertical farming and
    its various methods of indoor production has been discussed in order to understand
    its impact on global food production, especially as an option to eradicate or
    minimize the effects of urbanization over global food productivity. The use of
    artificial lighting with a purpose of providing an effective photosynthetic photon
    flux density has been discussed for better growth and development of various horticultural
    produce. Moreover, the current review discussed the various effective tactics,
    important techniques, IoT-based smart technologies, and the application of sensors,
    in addition to the constraints that exist worldwide as restrictions to adopting
    these smart technologies in agriculture. Future work will go on to explain the
    new emerging challenges and constraints, to accept and adopt the modern advancements
    for smart farming. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.A. and T.H.; methodology,

    4.0Machine learningSustainabilitySustainable development 1. Introduction In recent
    years, the agri-food sector has been gaining increasing attention. Recent data
    has indicated that by 2050, food production must double to fulfil the global population
    demand and that the global population will number approximately 9.8 billion by
    2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100 (Ojo et al., 2018). In addition, according to recent
    data published by FAO, approximately 33 % of all foodstuffs produced globally,
    corresponding to 930 million tonnes, is lost or wasted somewhere along the agri-food
    supply chain, leaving 800 million people hungry (Dora et al., 2021). The world''s
    expected population growth will undoubtedly result in increased waste generation
    and its environmental effect (Belaud et al., 2019). There is a widespread belief
    that the new Industry 4.0 (I4.0) enabling technologies have the capacity to revolutionise
    agriculture completely (Shepherd et al., 2020), guaranteeing greater food production
    using few resources (Lezoche et al., 2020), reducing food loss and waste, and
    having overall improved environmental implications (Galanakis et al., 2021). Indeed,
    the I4.0 concept is strictly related to the adoption and exploitation of new digital
    technologies, such as cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Internet of things (IoT),
    cloud computing, advanced manufacturing solutions, and big data analytics (Leone
    et al., 2021), whose application leads to an improvement in the overall company
    performance (Warner and Wäger, 2019). In agriculture, many of the expected advantages
    of digitalisation focus on higher efficiency via precision mechanisation, automation,
    and better decision-making (Fielke et al., 2020), as well as higher traceability
    through real-time data collection and sharing (Saetta and Caldarelli, 2020). Customers
    are increasingly looking for information on the whole supply chain of agri-food
    goods after several food safety risk occurrences and scandals in recent decades,
    such as the mad cow disease and horsemeat scandals (Zhao et al., 2019). Consequently,
    various key I4.0 technologies, such as the IoT and blockchain, have the potential
    to improve food safety, a top priority internationally, by enabling product identification,
    tracking, and tracing throughout the supply chain stages (Akyazi et al., 2020).
    According to Annosi et al. (2021), the food supply system in Europe wastes 88
    million tons of food produced and destined for human consumption every year. Therefore,
    traceability in the agri-food industry significantly increases food quality and
    safety (Kayikci et al., 2020), reducing the number of incorrect deliveries, excessive
    waiting times, and product losses (Müller et al., 2018), therefore optimising
    the entire agri-food supply chain. Moreover, developing wireless sensor technology
    (WST) applications in precision agriculture enables greater performance, productivity,
    and profitability while mitigating unintended environmental and wildlife damage
    (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). For instance, humidity and temperature sensors provide
    real-time knowledge from the fields (Adenugba et al., 2019), offering farmers
    a good foundation for adjusting strategies accordingly. As a result, there is
    evidence that innovation is critical to long-term sustainability in terms of technological
    improvements, optimisation, and efficiency of production systems (Aschemann-Witzel
    and Stangherlin, 2021). The adoption and integration of the new digital technologies
    (e.g. blockchain, IoT, big data) thus contribute to faster industrial transformation
    in the agri-food industry, transform business model companies within the sector
    and encourage the development in a shorter period and at a reduced cost of high-quality
    goods (Akyazi et al., 2020). This new technological paradigm has become increasingly
    important for modern enterprises aiming to survive and gain competitive advantages
    in a digital economy (Liu et al., 2011). Using I4.0 technologies, primary agricultural
    goals such as water saving, soil conservation, carbon mitigation, and improved
    production can be achieved (Lezoche et al., 2020). As for rice farming, the third-highest
    produced crop worldwide, recent literature has shown that modern technologies
    could increase the rice yields and reduce rise production costs (Hou et al., 2020).
    Thanks to these new technologies, it is possible to face various sustainability
    challenges, such as waste disposal and growth in food production (Appio et al.,
    2019), with a significant influence on society (Schallmo et al., 2017). Waste,
    energy, the economy, and the environment are essential pillars of Agenda 2030
    and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that must be addressed. The new digital
    technologies may significantly contribute to the achievement of multiple SDGs,
    such as SDG2, “zero hunger”, and SDG12, “responsible consumption and production”,
    helping companies increase food production and profits while reducing greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions and energy and resource consumption, owing to greater efficiency
    of operations across the whole supply chain (Ejsmont et al., 2020). In agriculture,
    the I4.0 paradigm can help the poor people by providing more basic resources and
    services, promoting sustainable agriculture and sustainable food consumption and
    production systems, providing new technologies for clean drinking water and sanitation,
    and fighting climate change (Režek Jambrak et al., 2021). In addition, I4.0 technologies
    may boost efficiency in the agri-food supply chain, particularly for perishable
    goods (Vernier et al., 2021), by lowering costs, improving accuracy, speeding
    up procedures, lowering food''s carbon footprint, and reducing food loss and waste
    (Amani and Sarkodie, 2022). Finally, sustainable development assumes that farmers''
    welfare must be protected, their living standards must be improved, and the connection
    between urban and rural populations must be maintained (Eashwar and Chawla, 2021).
    For example, thanks to I4.0, farmers may use IoT-based drones to regulate water
    distribution and pesticide irrigation from their homes (Patel and Doshi, 2020),
    thus improving crop yield and quality of life. Due to the significant increase
    in studies related to I4.0 and sustainability in the food sector, some researchers
    previously reviewed the literature on the topic from different perspectives (e.g.
    Secinaro et al., 2021; Gonzalez-De-Santos et al., 2020; Sarkar et al., 2020; Raheem,
    2020; Annosi et al., 2020; Corallo et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 2020; Eichler
    Inwood and Dale, 2019; Portanguen et al., 2019; Trappey et al., 2017; Wolfe and
    Richard, 2017; Trappey et al., 2016). Gonzalez-De-Santos et al. (2020) summarised
    the various architectures for robotic manipulators and mobile robots and the latest
    techniques used in smart factories. Sarkar et al. (2020) explored some technologies
    to mitigate the negative effects of farm production and various crop simulation
    models for predicting agricultural production under changing climatic circumstances.
    Raheem (2020) carried out a literature review on the benefits of digitalisation
    in the food sector to enhance efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. Annosi
    et al. (2020) investigated significant obstacles to the development of digital
    technologies by agri-food companies. Corallo et al. (2020) examined the relationship
    between traceability and the lifecycle of food products. Kamble et al. (2020)
    summarised the influence of big data analytics on farming companies'' supply chains.
    Eichler Inwood and Dale (2019) identified numerous software applications enabling
    farmers to recognise business performance-enhancing activities. Portanguen et
    al. (2019) examined additive manufacturing technology for developing food-biobased
    goods. Wolfe and Richard (2017) provided an overview of a range of new enabling
    technologies which could further reduce the carbon footprint and increase crop
    yields, bioenergy generation and farm economic efficiency. In addition, other
    studies have used professional sources and academic ones to contribute to the
    debate on how the new I4.0 technologies affect the agri-food sector. Notably,
    Secinaro et al. (2021) conducted a content and thematic analysis of both scientific
    papers collected from the Scopus database and patents obtained from the European
    Patent Office (EPO) dataset to explore how the enabling I4.0 technologies (such
    as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and augmented reality) can promote
    agri-businesses. Similarly, Trappey et al. (2017) employed a systematic approach
    to highlight how IoT technology standards and patents can be used as critical
    enablers for advanced manufacturing in the I4.0 context and different sectors,
    such as agriculture and hospitality. Finally, Trappey et al. (2016) offered a
    comprehensive review of the most recent CPS literature and a thorough examination
    of international standards and patent portfolios relating to the CPS architecture,
    with applications in different contexts such as healthcare and agriculture. Based
    on the above premises, in the scientific literature, there is a lack of comprehensive
    review that summarises the impact of I4.0 on sustainability in the agri-food sector
    holistically and evaluates research progress and trends on the topic for the benefit
    of multiple stakeholders. Notably, literature reviews can be conducted using different
    methodologies, such as structured and bibliometric reviews. The structured literature
    review evaluates academic literature to generate insights, critical reflections,
    future research directions, and research questions (Massaro et al., 2016). On
    another note, bibliometric analysis is a technique for rigorously studying and
    evaluating vast amounts of scientific data, enabling researchers to grasp the
    evolutionary intricacies while also shedding light on emergent areas (Donthu et
    al., 2021). However, the growing number of studies published every year made systematic
    review studies impossible to perform in a reasonable amount of time. Regarding
    the bibliometric methodology, even if this approach can manage a huge amount of
    data, numerous criticisms have been made since it is primarily based on citations.
    As a result, researchers more recently developed various software packages for
    semi-automating the examination process using machine learning (ML) and algorithms
    for text mining, significantly enhancing the systematic review process''s efficiency
    (Reddy et al., 2020; Marshall and Wallace, 2019; Cleo et al., 2019). The adoption
    level of these resources nowadays appears to be limited (Altena et al., 2019).
    As far as we know, no one has adopted these tools to provide relevant knowledge
    concerning I4.0 and agri-food sustainability and show the research field''s evolution.
    To overcome these limitations, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview
    of I4.0 and sustainability in the agri-food sector using advanced tools and algorithms,
    thus supporting researchers, policymakers, academicians, practitioners, farmers,
    and other decision-makers in exploring the complex domain of I4.0 in support of
    sustainable agriculture. The application of the ML tools allowed us to overcome
    the biases due to the manual selection of the systematic review process. The findings
    of this study will support managers and practitioners in driving the transition
    of agri-food firms to more digitalised and sustainable business models, resulting
    in advantages for themselves and society. To achieve this result, agribusiness
    firms'' leaders must totally rethink how they operate, develop innovative strategies,
    and create digital business models that are sustainable from both an economic
    and social standpoint. As a result, they should follow a logic that prioritises
    long-term, shared value creation over short-term efficiency and profitability.
    For instance, using I4.0 technologies may assist in minimising the use of resources,
    pollutants, and GHG emissions into the environment and regulate the impact of
    farming activities on soil and air quality. According to this viewpoint, businesses
    in the agri-food sector may provide long-term economic and environmental advantages
    while also improving their capacity to embrace efforts to combat climate change
    and avert the harmful effects of rising temperatures on the ecosystem. The structure
    of the paper is organised as follows: after this introduction, the next section
    explains the methodology used to support the review process and the material collection
    and selection phase. Section 3 highlights the results of the metadata analysis.
    Section 4 shows the content analysis of the papers. Section 5 discusses the research
    agenda for further investigation. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions
    and implications, specifying the contributions to theory, policy, and managerial
    practice, as well as the limitations of the study. 2. Methods, data collection
    and selection This section presents the literature review process, including the
    material collection and selection phases and the text mining and ML techniques
    used to support the review process. Notably, Fig. 1 highlights all the steps of
    the proposed methodology, starting from the definition of the search string to
    the development of the research agenda for further investigation. Download : Download

    process. 2.1. Data collection and selection The initial sample of articles was
    retrieved from the ISI Web of Science (WoS) database. More specifically, this
    study used the WoS Core Collection. WoS is a leading data source compared with
    other academic databases (such as Scopus and Google Scholar) (Shashi et al., 2021).
    Besides, the WoS comprises a wide variety of publications from various fields
    and study areas (Kamble et al., 2020; Aghaei Chadegani et al., 2013), including
    more than 15,000 high-quality journals and 50,000,000 articles, 251 research categories,
    and 150 subject areas for research (Shashi et al., 2020; Gaviria-Marin et al.,
    2019). In addition, WoS offers a large set of metadata, including abstract, references,
    citation count, authors and institutions names, countries, and the journal impact
    factor (Shashi et al., 2020; Gaviria-Marin et al., 2019). We used the R software
    to analyse the huge metadata set and perform text mining algorithms, thus quickly
    providing different descriptive statistics. In addition, RobotAnalyst has combined
    text mining and ML techniques to the metadata set, allowing semi-automating of
    the abstract/title screening process and automatically extracting data from article
    abstracts, supporting the content analysis phase. The keywords used to collect
    data were defined after a focus group between three researchers and refined once
    the frequency of the keywords adopted by previous studies was analysed. In particular,
    we initially considered a set of keywords related to the logical intersection
    of the paradigm of sustainability, the I4.0 technological perspective, and the
    agri-food industry. The keywords used for I4.0 were retrieved from the framework
    proposed by Calenda (2016). Finally, we compared our keywords with those used
    in the individual articles discovered in the initial list to confirm our search
    string further. According to a keywords'' frequency analysis, “digital platform*”
    and “intelligent system*” were found to be included in more than 10 % of the publications.
    As a result, we included these keywords in the final search string: ((“Industry
    4.0” OR “industry4.0” OR “industrie 4.0” OR “industrie4.0” OR “fourth industrial
    revolution” OR “4th industrial revolution” OR “industrial internet” OR “artificial
    intelligence” OR “cybersecurity” OR “cyber-security” OR “cyber security” OR “autonomous
    robot*” OR “cloud computing” OR “augmented reality” OR “virtual reality” OR “internet
    of things” OR “big data” OR “iot*” OR “additive manufacturing” OR “3d prin*” OR
    “rapid manufacturing” OR “advanced manufacturing” OR “intelligent system*” OR
    simulation OR “digital platform*” OR “machine learning” OR blockchain OR “block-chain”
    OR wearables OR “digital technolog*” OR “digital transformation” OR digitalization
    OR digitalisation OR “4.0” OR “digitization” OR “automation” OR “autonomous system”
    OR “robot” OR “cyber-physical” OR “phygital” OR “wearable” OR “sensor”) AND (“environmental
    management” OR “sustainable operation*” OR “Environmental responsibility” OR “sustainable
    development” OR “triple bottom line” OR “circular economy” OR “environmental sustainability”
    OR “social sustainability” OR “corporate social responsibility”) AND (“food” OR
    “agri-food” OR “agrifood” OR “agriculture”)). This search string, characterised
    by fifty-five keywords, was used to obtain documents containing those words in
    the title, abstract, or keywords. Moreover, the asterisk (*) was used to merge
    both singular and plural keywords. The data search was conducted on 5th February
    2021, and an initial sample of 673 documents was retrieved. We adopted different
    filters to refine the analysis. First, we decided to restrict the time frame analysed
    from 2011 to 2021 because of the actuality of the research topic (Desore and Narula,
    2018). Indeed, the I4.0 concept first appeared in 2011 in a report diffused by
    the German government (Gajdzik et al., 2020). We also refined our investigation
    by limiting the data collection to English-language articles (Shashi et al., 2020).
    To ensure the accuracy of the examined sources, we also decided to only select
    articles and reviews published in double-blind, peer-reviewed journals (Shashi
    et al., 2020); therefore, we excluded other sources such as conference proceedings,
    book series, extended abstracts, and reports. A sample of 466 papers was obtained
    after these choices. Subsequently, we adopted different exclusion and inclusion
    criteria described in the following sub-section. 2.1.1. Exclusion and inclusion
    criteria As a first exclusion criterion for this study, we followed Pittaway et
    al. (2004) and carefully examined each paper''s abstract to ensure that we only
    included research that specifically addressed digitalisation in the context of
    sustainable agri-food industry. Notably, we used RobotAnalyst to support the abstracts
    and titles screening process. After manually screening a certain number of references,
    the RobotAnalyst ML algorithm was trained to predict the probability that an unlabelled
    citation should have been included. Notably, an inclusion prediction probability
    (0 to 1) was allocated to each unlabelled reference. Therefore, RobotAnalyst implemented
    an automated screening process to mark the remaining citations in the database.
    Notably, if the inclusion confidence of an unlabelled citation was minor than
    0.5, it was excluded from the collection; otherwise, it was included. Two lists
    of documents were obtained based on this semi-automated process. List A included
    papers whose abstracts focus on the impact of I4.0 technologies on the agri-food
    industry''s sustainability performance. Thus, these papers focus on the paradigm
    of sustainability, the I4.0 technological perspective, and the agri-food sector.
    In contrast, list B includes articles whose abstracts do not simultaneously focus
    on the three dimensions simultaneously (mainly abstract that concentrates on sustainability
    in the agri-food sector but without any specific technological application). Before
    removing the articles included in list B (340), a sample check of about 20 % of
    the excluded documents was carried out by reading the abstracts to verify that
    they really were not aligned with the topic. Further, the remaining 126 papers
    included in list A were subjected to the second exclusion criterion, which involved
    reading the full-text of the manuscripts. Two researchers examined the papers
    simultaneously, with a third researcher to resolve any potential doubts (Cerchione
    and Esposito, 2016). Full-text reading allowed us to analyse the content of the
    articles in-depth and discard those that did not focus on the research topic.
    As a result of the second exclusion criterion, 28 studies were excluded. Finally,
    we employed a “snowball” technique as an inclusion criterion to find the additional
    potentially relevant studies (Greenhalgh and Peacock, 2005). Notably, snowballing
    is the process of finding new articles by looking through a paper''s reference
    list or citation list. As a result of this inclusion criterion, we added 11 more
    papers on the subject into the text corpus. The final inclusion criterion ensured
    that all relevant studies were included in the final sample of articles. Consequently,
    the final sample comprised 109 documents. 3. Metadata analysis Metadata extraction
    and analysis were performed to show papers distribution over time and provide
    essential information for future research summarising the most influential journals
    and countries in the research field. Different R packages for data science included
    in the tidyverse collection (e.g. dplyr and ggplot2) were used to perform exploratory
    data analysis, thus modelling, manipulating, and visualising data. As a result,
    the R software was used to transform a set of unstructured data into structured
    value-added data. 3.1. Distribution of papers by year of publication The search
    for articles started in 2011, the year in which the concept of I4.0 appeared for
    the first time. As shown in Fig. 2, the number of published papers has exponentially
    increased to a maximum of 52 in 2020, thus highlighting a growing interest in
    the topic investigated over time. Fig. 2 also reports the number of publications
    in 2021 (6) for completeness. Therefore, the distribution of papers emphasises
    that the field of I4.0 and sustainability in the agri-food industry is very recent:
    approximately 70 % of papers have been published from 2019 to early 2021. Notably,
    the attention of researchers seems to have arisen from the Hannover event “Agritechnica
    2013”, a leading fair for technical innovations in the agri-food sector. Furthermore,
    thanks to the extensive program of specialised international events, including
    congresses, meetings, and press conferences, Agritechnica is considered the most
    important forum for the future of the agricultural sector. Download : Download

    per year. 3.2. Academic journals Considering the journals publishing in the investigated
    research field, it is interesting to highlight how widespread it in the literature.
    The articles in our sample are available in 80 different journals. Notably, the
    journals that published at least two papers on I4.0 and sustainability in the
    agri-food sector from 2011 to early 2021 are shown in Fig. 3. The most significant
    contributor is the International Journal of Production Economics (6 papers), followed
    by IEEE Access (4 papers), Sensors (3 papers), Remote sensing (3 papers), Journal
    of Cleaner Production (3 papers), British Food Journal (3 papers), Agronomy-Basel
    (3 papers), and Agricultural Systems (3 papers). Looking at SCImago rankings to
    assess the scientific impact of each journal, all the outlets displayed in Fig.
    3 are in the Quartile 1 (Q1) except Sustainability (Q2), British Food Journal
    (Q2), Foods (Q2), and Computers and Electronics in Agriculture (Q2). The leading
    journals publishing on food sustainability and I4.0 have wider scopes and belong
    to different domains, confirming the broader range of coverage I4.0 and sustainability
    issues have gained over the years. Download : Download high-res image (652KB)

    Country analysis Fig. 4 classifies papers according to the nationality of the
    authors. Only countries with at least five papers published per each are reported.
    Notably some papers were co-authored by researchers of various nationalities,
    while others were co-authored by multiple researchers of the same nationality.
    In the first scenario, the nationality of each researcher who co-authored the
    article was counted separately; in the latter case, the nationality was counted
    once, even if two or more scholars had co-authored the manuscript. The top contributing
    country is Italy (24 papers), followed by China (20 papers), and the United States
    of America (USA) (16 papers). The first place of Italy is not unexpected because
    the Italian government in 2016 launched the “Italy: Industry 4.0” plan (Garzoni
    et al., 2020), i.e. the Italian national strategy for the digitalisation of industry.
    It includes a wide range of policy measures to stimulate international investment
    and innovation-driven economic growth. Download : Download high-res image (718KB)

    according to Troise et al. (2021), agri-food is a major industry sector worldwide,
    particularly in Europe, which is at the top of the ranking concerning publications
    on I4.0 and sustainability in the agri-food sector since about 48 % of the top
    publishing countries'' papers displayed in Fig. 4 are European. Besides, Fig.
    4 highlights the prominent role of both China and the USA in the I4.0 research.
    Indeed, even if the concept of I4.0 was built in Europe, China''s economy launched
    in 2015 the “Made in China 2025”, an initiative to turn China into a world‑leading
    manufacturing force directly encouraging Germany''s “Industry 4.0” strategy (Wang
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the USA has established an initiative called “A Strategy
    for American Innovation” to generate additional jobs and improve its Information
    and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership (Min et al., 2019). 4. Cluster analysis
    This sub-section describes the cluster analysis procedure. This technique aims
    to group references into different clusters, one for each theme covered, thus
    supporting and speeding up the content analysis of the papers. The RobotAnalyst
    software provides an interface for descriptive clustering algorithms to group
    the references into non-overlapping clusters, each identified by a set of keywords.
    The keywords are automatically extracted and chosen as the most descriptive group
    to discriminate the cluster references from other references. Each cluster is
    a group of similar references. The keywords are prevalent within the cluster,
    mainly located in the cluster, and cover the cluster''s specific theme. Notably,
    spectral clustering is used to generate these groups. It works by applying the
    term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting on the cosine similarities
    between a vector bag of words representing abstracts and titles, considering only
    words that appear at least five times in the collection and are not included in
    the stop-words list (Przybyła et al., 2018). Subsequently, a statistical selection
    method is used to concisely determine a group of words describing each cluster.
    More precisely, the algorithm primarily selects cluster-related keywords and uses
    then the conditional criterion for mutual optimisation of information to reduce
    redundancy. For each cluster, the number of keywords used is chosen using the
    Bayesian information criterion to statistical model order selection after a model
    has been designed to predict membership based on keyword presence. Finally, the
    keywords are sorted by their weights for each cluster (Przybyła et al., 2018).
    The results of the clustering process are demonstrated in Table 1. Table 1. References

    Digitalisation and precision agriculture Precision agriculture is a farm management
    strategy that uses information technology to acquire data that leads to decisions
    aimed at agricultural production. The aim is to match land and crop management
    with the specific needs of a diverse field to improve production, minimise environmental
    damage and raise the quality standards of agricultural products. Precision agriculture
    techniques could minimise wasteful resource consumption and pollution and thereby
    increase the quality of life, which contributes to achieving sustainable development
    goals (Bhakta et al., 2019). In this regard, Clapp and Ruder (2020) examined the
    advancement of precision agriculture technologies – specifically digital farming
    and plant genome editing – and their consequences for environmental sustainability
    policies in the agri-food industry. Trivelli et al. (2019) examined how I4.0 and
    precision agriculture are linked by examining the most widely applied innovations
    in both fields to identify similar trends and technical intersects. Dunchev (2019)
    conducted a survey to assess the cost-effectiveness of precision technologies
    in soft fruit production and explore the feasibility of implementing them. Almadani
    and Mostafa (2021) summarised new technologies used in the agri-food industry
    to improve productivity, optimise costs, and promote sustainable development.
    Further, they proposed a multimodal communication model that uses the Data Distribution
    Service (DDS) middleware to coordinate communication among diverse production
    systems. Regarding precision fertilisation, Huettel et al. (2020) used a rational
    action approach that included behavioural, social, and control dimensions to analyse
    intentions and actual use of sustainable digital fertilisation approaches. Giannoccaro
    et al. (2020) showed the development, construction, testing, and control of the
    dosage system of fluid and granular fertilisers with an innovative low-cost system
    to support crops and achieve more precise farming. Likely, Chen et al. (2014)
    proposed three precision fertilisation techniques: testing soil for formulated
    fertilisation technology, decision support system, and expert decision support
    system. Moreover, as mentioned above, the IoT is at the heart of intelligent agriculture,
    and it has the potential to reform and improve conventional agriculture to lower
    costs, reduce emissions, and boost efficiency and quality (Wu and Ma, 2020). Cloud
    computing systems and wireless networks are at the heart of the IoT since it collects
    data from sensor groups and uses decision analysis to modify object behaviour
    control and feedback (Cai et al., 2019). In this context, Kamienski et al. (2019)
    developed an intelligent water management platform based on IoT technology to
    provide the exact volume of water needed by crops. In order to monitor temperature,
    Cai et al. (2019) designed a smart greenhouse control system based on both IoT
    and WSN technologies. Likely, Srbinovska et al. (2015) designed a useful and cheap
    greenhouse monitoring system based on WST. This architecture can monitor and regulate
    critical environmental parameters such as temperature, moisture, and lighting,
    based on various I4.0T, including sensors and cloud, thus conserving natural resources,
    improving food quality, and lowering management and agri-business costs. As a
    result, these technologies can provide crops with the exact amount of resources
    they need, improving their fertility and avoiding waste and environmental pollution.
    Other researchers systemically reviewed the literature on the topic of digitalisation
    in the agri-food industry. For instance, Annosi et al. (2020) reviewed the literature
    to investigate the most common obstacles for agri-food companies when adopting
    emerging technologies. On another note, Ciruela-Lorenzo et al. (2020) analysed
    the digital innovation advancement in agri-cooperatives to assist them in the
    decision-making phase. As a result, these developments can move agriculture closer
    to the idea of intelligent farms. Moreover, Rose et al. (2021) highlighted the
    importance of including social responsibility in the concept of agriculture 4.0,
    which has far-reaching social consequences, both positive and negative. Other
    authors focused on quantitative studies. Bai et al. (2020) proposed a hybrid multi-situation
    decision method that is integrated by hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect
    theory, and VIKOR to assess the impact of I4.0 technologies on food companies''
    sustainability performance. Carillo and Abeni (2020) proposed a statistical two-stage
    regression method to quantify whether there is an intermediate productivity gap
    in herd management among agri-food companies with different degrees of digitisation
    adoption. This study utilised the outcomes of a survey on the Lombardy dairy farm
    (Italy). Finally, Thomas et al. (2018) conducted a survey, follow-up interviews,
    and visits to 32 food companies in the UK to investigate Smart Systems'' applicability,
    defining the main priority dimensions and improvement levers for such a system''s
    application. 4.2. Remote sensing technologies in agriculture The increasing demand
    for food and energy supplies worldwide increases climate change risk due to higher
    agricultural GHG emissions. Therefore, it is widely acknowledged that agriculture
    should establish a new environmental sustainability framework that includes GHG
    emissions reduction (Julius Szakacs et al., 2011). In this context, remote science
    has developed more accurate, consistent, and reliable methods for capturing land
    dynamics to meet different knowledge needs (Olofsson et al., 2014). For instance,
    Julius Szakacs et al. (2011) used remote sensing systems to evaluate current and
    potential soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in degraded pastures quickly and low-costly.
    Singh (2021) summarised various approaches to resolving environmental concerns
    about soil salinisation, highlighting different remote sensing techniques and
    geographic information systems. Liu et al. (2020) used the Google Earth Engine
    cloud computing platform to develop a 30-m planetary-scale cropping intensity
    (CI) mapping application. CI was estimated using this method in eight geographic
    regions across continents that indicate global cropping system diversity from
    2016 to 2018. Weiss et al. (2020) reviewed the leading remote sensing technologies
    used in agriculture for different scopes, such as agricultural land use monitoring
    and crop yield forecasting. Li et al. (2019) demonstrated a cloud-assisted mobile
    robot area control strategy in an intelligent greenhouse. Shen et al. (2019) developed
    and tested a robust drought monitoring model using deep learning methods based
    on multi-source remote sensing data in Henan Province, China. Holloway and Mengersen
    (2018) reviewed the literature on statistical machine learning techniques widely
    used for remote sensing data. Using statistical analysis of remote sensing data
    to generate measurements of the environment, agriculture, and sustainable development
    has risen in popularity, resulting in increased cooperation between earth science
    and statistical domains. Finally, Singha et al. (2017) analysed the usefulness
    of time-based characteristics extracted from gross resolution data for object-based
    paddy rice classification of fine resolution data. To increase classification
    accuracy, temporal features were extracted from the fused data and added using
    multi-spectral data. The temporal characteristics provided information about crop
    growth, while multi-spectral data provided the paddy rice pattern variation. 4.3.
    Digital technologies to improve traceability and food safety Due to the recurrent
    cases of food-borne diseases, social sustainability aspects, such as public health,
    traceability, and safety, have gotten much attention in the agri-food sector.
    Digital technologies have high potential for improving these factors. First, Corallo
    et al. (2020) conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the relationship
    between food traceability and product lifecycle and highlight methods and technologies
    used by the food industry. Raheem (2020) reviewed the literature on digitalisation''s
    advantages, highlighting that digital technology opportunities should increase
    the transparency, efficiency, and sustainability status of the local food business
    operators. On another note, Farooq et al. (2016) proposed an electronic pedigree
    traceability system based on integrating RFID and sensor technology for real-time
    agricultural food monitoring to prevent the distribution of dangerous and adulterated
    food items. Lin et al. (2017) proposed a blockchain-based ICT e-agriculture framework
    for both local and regional levels. This system increases farmers'' access to
    high-quality data and agricultural services, enhances traceability, and certifies
    conformity with international standards. Notably, many precision agriculture developments,
    managerial support tools, and offering more access to clients rely on ICT (Bowen
    and Morris, 2019). Different authors discuss the role of food-sharing platforms.
    For instance, Jaeger and Mishra (2020) conducted a case study of the company-level
    IoT platform for seafood farmers that meets the end-to-end traceability demands
    of consumers while collecting data from downstream partners'' information requests.
    Mazzucchelli et al. (2021) used multiple regression and fuzzy-set qualitative
    comparative analysis to highlight the effects and interactions between five factors
    that contribute to the success of food-sharing platforms and their role in influencing
    consumer behaviour. 4.4. Modern technologies to improve soil health and fertility
    This research cluster is mainly focused on models and strategies to monitor and
    predict crop yields and improve soil health and fertility. Shi et al. (2018) developed
    a variable-rate fertilisation model to improve fertilisation accuracy and uniformity.
    Gaydon et al. (2021) analysed the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)
    model, which has been able to simulate the performance of cropping systems from
    different perspectives, such as crop production and water consumption. Bhanarkar
    and Korake (2016) designed a wireless sensor network (WSN) for measuring and monitoring
    soil moisture and salinity. Miao et al. (2011) summarised different nitrogen management
    strategies that should be used to boost crop yields and reduce the environmental
    impact. Mandal et al. (2020) reviewed diverse simulation models and remote sensing
    techniques used to forecast and map soil carbon status and define site-specific
    strategic policies to reduce the risk of land degradation and preserve environmental
    sustainability. Ahmad et al. (2020) conducted a systematic literature review to
    investigate the soil erosion management methods implemented and evaluated on agricultural
    land in Asia. 4.5. Simulation models to predict energy consumption In the I4.0
    context, different simulation models have been used within the farms to predict
    energy consumption. In addition, these models can estimate the environmental impact
    of infrastructure and management practice changes. Notenbaert et al. (2020) used
    the CLEANED model to evaluate livestock intervention with minimal environmental
    impact, improving incomes and food safety. Shine et al. (2020) summarised the
    milk energy research from the perspective of monitoring, modelling predictions
    and analysis. Vayssieres et al. (2011) analysed the GAMEDE model, which was used
    to highlight the dynamics of the farm''s key biophysical and decisional processes
    that influence labour, gross margin, and energy and nutrient flow in the farms.
    4.6. Emerging technologies supporting agri-food supply chain management It is
    well acknowledged that emerging technologies can support agri-food supply chain
    management. In this regard, Nosratabadi et al. (2020) reviewed the impact of new
    technologies on sustainable business model innovation of agri-food companies.
    The key factors that cause companies to innovate their business models have been
    identified in e-commerce and IoT technology. Kamble et al. (2020) proposed a framework
    for agri-food supply chain practitioners that recognises supply chain visibility
    and supply chain resources as the primary driving forces for improving big data
    analytics capability and achieving sustainable performance. Gruzauskas et al.
    (2019) developed a collaborative technical strategy that encourages knowledge
    sharing to enhance forecasting accuracy and inventory management, allowing food
    demand and supply to be better aligned, thus reducing food waste. Machine learning
    algorithms are used in the forecasting process to provide supply chain participants
    with adaptation competencies. Ahearn et al. (2016) analysed the agri-food supply
    chain''s main challenges in adopting big data to distinguish and classify final
    products based on underlying farm output attributes sought by supply chain consumers.
    Two examples demonstrate this, one considering using a sustainability metric and
    the other considering the possibility of increasing food safety. Dauvergne (2020)
    argued that productivity and efficiency increases obtained through AI in the middle
    parts of supply chains reverberate into more food production and consumption,
    benefiting big businesses even more than the environment''s long-term viability.
    4.7. Advanced technologies used to reduce water consumption This cluster includes
    studies concerning new advanced technologies used to optimise water consumption.
    Mashaly and Fernald (2020) shed light on studies concerning System Dynamics (SD)
    and AI to better manage water use, highlighting limitations and challenges. Polinova
    et al. (2019) explored the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model to optimise
    water management for cotton production. Zhou et al. (2019) proposed a holistic
    system-wide approach focused on water management perspectives that promotes small-scale
    hydropower generation while exploiting the synergies of the Water-Food-Energy
    (WFE) Nexus through artificial intelligence techniques. Adenugba et al. (2019)
    proposed an irrigation system that works based on sensors'' environmental data
    using an IoT architecture. Data collected are used to predict environmental conditions
    such as humidity, temperature, and weather forecast used to manage the irrigation
    system. 4.8. Digital technologies in support of the circular economy Regarding
    the relationship between I4.0 and circular economy, Cane and Parra (2020) conducted
    multiple case studies to explore the role of different mobile platforms in reducing
    food waste, thus contributing to circularity. Michelini et al. (2020) conducted
    two focus groups to examine the possible impact of food-sharing platform business
    models in reducing food waste and the main barriers to calculating this impact.
    Fisher et al. (2020) explored how data-driven models can be used in the agri-food
    industry to promote the circular economy, process resilience, and waste valorisation
    principles. The growing availability of data is driving the increased use of data-driven
    models in manufacturing due to the introduction of low-cost industrial IoT technology,
    as well as increased processing capacity from cloud computing. Other studies focused
    on 3D printing applications. This new technology gives people more flexibility
    to design, produce, and innovate in various fields, including food production.
    Portanguen et al. (2019) reviewed the literature on AM in the food industry, showing
    that this new method could improve food safety and quality and reduce food waste.
    Lupton and Turner (2018) conducted an online discussion group to explore consumer
    behaviour on 3D printing applications concerning the production of laboratory-cultured
    meat or insect-based ingredients to promote ethical consumption and food safety.
    Furthermore, Sfragano et al. (2020) reviewed different printing technologies adopted
    for the sustainable production of sensors, including 3D printing and screen-printing,
    as well as the new eco-friendly materials proposed for these systems, such as
    cellulose and silk proteins. In the circular economy context, these innovative
    approaches and materials can ensure a reduced environmental footprint reducing
    the volume and the impact of waste coming from these processes. 4.9. Cloud-based
    platforms to acquire and manage data Recent research acknowledged that applying
    geospatial Decision Support Systems (DSS) is a feasible and efficient tool for
    acquiring and managing data. Manna et al. (2020) demonstrated how a new type of
    DSS built on the open-source Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) platform could
    serve as a critical web-based operational tool for olive farming by better connecting
    productivity and environmental sustainability. This system allows for collecting,
    managing, and processing data (e.g., pedology, everyday climate) and data visualisation
    and machine on-the-fly applications for simulation modelling (e.g., assessment
    of bioclimatic indices). Likely, Terribile et al. (2017) used a geospatial DSS
    developed on the GCI platform to improve the quality of viticulture by better-linking
    agriculture and landscape levels. The GCI platform enables the collection, management,
    elaboration, and on-the-ground simulation modelling of static and dynamic information
    (e.g. pedology, daily climate, and wine distribution), data view, and on-the-fly
    computer applications (e.g. grapevine water stress, and evaluation of ecosystem
    services). 4.10. The role of I4.0 technologies in mitigating climate change This
    research cluster focuses on the relationship between climate change and agri-food
    production and the role that technologies play in mitigating global warming. Notably,
    Bhaga et al. (2020) reviewed recent applications to assess the impact of climate
    variability and droughts on water resources in sub-Saharan Africa using remote
    sensing technologies. On another note, Sarkar et al. (2020) analysed low-input
    sustainable agriculture techniques to boot agri-food production in a warming world.
    5. Discussion of the results The descriptive statistics provided a broad overview
    of the articles included in the literature review, emphasising that, in recent
    years, there has been a growing focus on I4.0 and sustainability in the agri-food
    industry and that these subjects have a variety of scopes, belong to different
    disciplines and countries, and are covered by different journals. On another note,
    RobotAnalyst software was used to support the content analysis of the selected
    articles, identify the literature''s strengths and weaknesses, and highlight current
    research and future research directions. As a result, the selected papers can
    be classified into four main research areas: 1) Agriculture 4.0; 2) Circular economy;
    3) Supply chain management; and 4) Simulation models. Table 2 displays a more
    in-depth description of current research and future study proposals for each of
    these scientific clusters. Table 2. Current research and future research directions.

    practices for enhancing carbon storage in the soil and increasing soil health
    and fertility 5.1. Agriculture 4.0 The first research area discusses the concept
    of agriculture 4.0. This term indicates significant trends within the industry,
    including a greater focus on precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, IoT,
    and big data use to drive increased corporate efficiency in the face of increasing
    populations and climate change (Gonzalez-de-Santos et al., 2020). In this context,
    current research focuses on developing and applying specific technologies in agriculture
    to monitor and boost crop yields, save natural resources, and promote sustainable
    development. However, in-depth studies with a holistic perspective that evaluates
    the impact of different digital technologies (e.g. blockchain, IoT, and big data
    analytics) on the sustainability performance of the agri-food industry are lacking.
    Even if the use of advanced information technology in the agri-food sector was
    recommended many years ago and argued to be necessary for businesses to survive
    in the long term, there is little research and knowledge regarding how I4.0 technologies
    could be used to address the agri-food industry''s sustainability challenges,
    and the few studies in the literature reveal conflicting results. It would also
    be interesting to investigate what circular economy strategies are being applied
    at each point in the agri-food supply chain to reduce food loss and waste and
    if I4.0 technologies could support them. Therefore, future researchers in this
    domain could conduct multiple case studies through direct interviews with companies
    adopting I4.0 technologies and sustainable practices to analyse the relationship
    between I4.0 and sustainability and understand the benefits, barriers, and motivations
    for their implementation. Furthermore, by conducting a long-term longitudinal
    study, it is possible to observe the effectiveness of I4.0 technologies over time.
    Through this exploratory research will be possible to assess whether the changes
    in the way business models are structured in terms of technological innovations
    lead to better organisational economic, environmental, and social performance.
    Indeed, according to Brenes et al. (2016), business models are set-ups that impact
    a company''s success or failure. 5.2. Circular economy The second research area
    concerns the circular economy, which can be defined as a regenerative system that
    minimises resource usage and waste, GHG emissions, and energy leakage by decelerating,
    closing, and narrowing material and energy loops (Miranda et al., 2021). In the
    context of sustainable agri-food and I4.0, extant research is focused on the ability
    of the digital technologies to reduce the waste of resources and food. Unlike
    previous industrial models which are characterised by linearly producing waste,
    I4.0 seeks to minimise or eliminate waste, promoting circularity (Lopes de Sousa
    et al., 2018). Thanks to new technologies, it is possible to monitor resources
    and keep waste production under control, improving the operational performance
    of a sustainable supply chain (Ejsmont et al., 2020). However, there is a lack
    of studies that compare different I4.0 technologies as well as sustainable and
    circular practices to determine the most beneficial solution for the environment,
    thus reducing wastage of food and resources and contributing to circularity. Therefore,
    we propose shared best practices based on circular economy tools to define sustainable
    paths for companies in the agri-food sector. Therefore, future investigations
    could use the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to estimate the environmental
    impact of alternative digital technologies and circular economy practices used
    in the food supply chain. Furthermore, it is also possible to estimate the environmental
    impact of food production before and after implementing technological solutions
    to assess whether they have contributed to reducing the waste of food and resources
    as well as CO2 emissions. The LCA represents a great tool to support the circular
    economy, as it allows for the calculation of the total environmental impact of
    all stages of a product''s life cycle, thus identifying the inefficiencies and
    reducing the waste of resources (Nasir et al., 2017). Finally, future researchers
    could investigate the factors affecting foodstuffs'' sustainable consumer behaviour.
    Indeed, by carrying out surveys on the primary factors influencing consumer behaviour
    regarding food waste, such as sustainable packaging and labelling, as well as
    blockchain-based QR codes for food traceability, companies will be able to leverage
    those factors to foster a more sustainable production and consumption model. In
    addition, by investigating the driving factors affecting consumer behaviour towards
    food waste, policymakers for sustainable food consumption could develop consumer
    awareness programs to help achieve SDG 12 (Rasool et al., 2021). 5.3. Supply chain
    management The third research area concerns supply chain management. This cluster
    discusses different digital technologies (e.g. RFID systems, big data, and artificial
    intelligence) used in the agri-food industry to ensure the traceability of products
    and improved efficiency of the entire supply chain. According to Kamble et al.
    (2020), blockchain is a powerful enabler of a sustainable agri-food supply chain,
    as it improves the transparency of information (Fu et al., 2018). However, the
    use of blockchain technology in the agri-food sector is still in its early stages
    (Stranieri et al., 2021). Few articles in the scientific literature have analysed
    the development and implementation of blockchain-based systems supporting smart
    agriculture traceability. Moreover, because consumers are increasingly concerned
    about food quality and safety (Shahid et al., 2020), blockchain could help address
    traceability issues while ensuring sustainable development (Li et al., 2020).
    This new enabling technology has the potential to solve several issues relating
    to consumer concerns about the products they purchase (Borrero, 2019). Nevertheless,
    there are still unresolved concerns and challenges associated with blockchain
    technology that require further inquiry and investigation (Ali et al., 2021).
    As a result, future research could analyse the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain-based
    systems for sustainable agri-food and develop new blockchain and IoT architectures
    for agri-food traceability. The decentralised and secure nature of blockchains
    makes it an ideal technology for communication between the individual nodes of
    an IoT network. These architectures could then allow the consumer to become part
    of the company''s decision-making process, such as intervening and producing changes
    in the crop production process. 5.4. Simulation models Finally, the fourth research
    area focuses on simulation models. Current research is mainly focused on applying
    these models to simulate crop production, resource consumption, and soil carbon
    status, as well as to model the effects of a farmer''s daily management decisions
    on a farm''s overall sustainability. Consequently, future research could develop
    and apply simulation models that can be used to determine the best agricultural
    management strategies for enhancing carbon storage in the soil and increasing
    soil health and fertility. 6. Conclusions and implications 6.1. Contribution to
    theory This study makes several contributions to the literature. First, it offers
    a broad systematic overview of I4.0 and sustainability in the agri-food industry,
    evaluating the evolution of the research domain over time and providing essential
    information for future research summarising the most influential journals and
    countries in the research field. Second, this analysis goes beyond the systemic
    review of literature by using automation tools and techniques for selecting the
    most relevant works and the critical subjects analysed by the authors in the field.
    Notably, text classification and data extraction are the ML techniques used to
    automate this research. Text classification is used to screen the title and abstract,
    while data extraction is used to identify the main topics on which the sample
    of documents is focused, thus grouping the articles into 10 research clusters,
    i.e. “digitalisation and precision agriculture”, “remote sensing technologies
    in agriculture”, “digital technologies to improve traceability and food safety”,
    “modern technologies to improve soil health and fertility”, “simulation models
    to predict energy consumption”, “emerging technologies in the current agri-food
    supply chain”, “advanced technologies used to reduce water consumption”, “digital
    technologies in support of circular economy”, “cloud-based platforms to acquire
    and manage data”, and “the role of I4.0 technologies in mitigating climate change”.
    Consequently, the systematic review process has allowed us to identify the major
    challenges in the field, highlighting the crucial role of the new digital technologies
    in improving agricultural and food production through monitoring, modelling, and
    optimisation of operations. Moreover, this study offers a reference point for
    future research, emphasising potential new areas of investigation for both quantitative
    and qualitative studies. Notably, our research highlighted the enabling technologies
    that should be further investigated in the agri-food sector, such as the blockchain.
    Indeed, blockchain is a relatively new technology that is expanding rapidly, achieving
    new business areas. Even in I4.0, blockchain technology is increasingly important
    in developing efficient and sustainable supply chain management (Zhang and Chen,
    2020). High traceability and transparency, fewer errors and delays, accelerated
    problem detection, enhanced customer and partner trust, lower transportation costs,
    and better product transportation are just a few advantages of blockchain technology
    adoption (Centobelli et al., 2021). Thus, the potential for applying blockchain-based
    platforms in the agri-food supply chain is huge (Borrero, 2019) and should be
    better explored (Ali et al., 2021). In addition, scholars could conduct long-term
    longitudinal studies to observe the effectiveness of I4.0 technologies over time.
    On the other hand, quantitative researchers could focus on conducting surveys
    and investigating the factors affecting sustainable consumer behaviour towards
    foodstuffs, such as sustainable labelling and packaging, as well as using blockchain
    technology to track and trace the product during its lifecycle. 6.2. Implications
    for policymakers and agribusiness firms This research offers multiple opportunities
    for public authorities, organisations, and practitioners to leverage the advantages
    of digital technologies in the agri-food sector. This paper therefore presents
    a wide range of relevant knowledge concerning how I4.0 technologies are affecting
    agri-food companies. Such an overview is essential for agribusiness firms'' managers
    because it allows them to innovate their business models and solve critical problems
    by exploiting the potentials of this new technological paradigm. This work helps
    managers analyse the current state of I4.0 in the agriculture and food industry
    regarding innovations, technology, and assessment, so that they may make appropriate
    decisions about using these tools and thereby enhance sustainable environmental
    efficiency. As a result, the findings of this study suggest a substantial transition
    in the workforce in the imminent future, with more complex, software-related occupations
    being created. At the same time, more routine employment is being replaced by
    robots or comparable technology. This suggests that the labour market will fundamentally
    alter its structure, significantly influencing not just a country''s economy but
    also potential offshore and outsourcing decisions made by businesses and, ultimately,
    the structure of global trade. As a result, agribusiness companies need to radically
    reassess their operations, develop strategies that are not business as usual,
    and create resilient digital business models from both an economic and social
    perspective. To connect with the numerous partners that make up the external ecosystem,
    for instance, businesses may need to rebuild their supply chains from the perspective
    of value creation for society as a whole rather than value appropriation for the
    firm itself. Adopting a social vision requires agri-food firms to recognise that
    the transition to such digitalised and sustainable business models results in
    advantages for both them and society. For instance, using precision agriculture
    technologies based on IoT may assist firms in boosting crop efficiency and productivity
    and minimising resource consumption by providing crops with the exact amount of
    water and fertiliser they need. Therefore, agri-food firms can regulate the impact
    that farming activities have on soil and air quality, avoiding overlapping passes
    by tractors and reducing the use of pollutants and the emission of CO2 gases into
    the environment. In addition, agribusiness managers can employ new technological
    tools like blockchain to accomplish the sustainable goals of improved transparency
    and traceability of agri-food products in the supply chain, reducing food loss
    and waste while lowering costs, decreasing the risk of mistakes and fraud, and
    speeding up procedures. According to this viewpoint, businesses in the agri-food
    sector may provide long-term economic, environmental, and social advantages while
    also improving their capacity to embrace efforts to combat world hunger and climate
    change and avert the harmful effects of rising temperatures on the ecosystem.
    Furthermore, this study also has significant policy implications. The seventeen
    SDGs highlight the seriousness and breadth of today''s sustainability concerns
    (Sauermann et al., 2020). Moreover, the estimated increase in food demand in the
    next few years and several issues related to environmental pollution and global
    warming will require great attention from institutions and stakeholders. Therefore,
    this research has significant repercussions for regional and national growth.
    Policymakers and governments working on sustainable agriculture initiatives should
    use our study''s findings to promote and implement digital technologies in the
    agri-food supply chains to improve crop yield, minimise carbon footprint, and
    promote sustainable development. For instance, government policies may include
    incentives and subsidised loans for farmers to purchase new machinery and green
    technologies for more sustainable food production, reducing CO2 emissions and
    the risk of accidents. As a result, sustainable business models in the agri-food
    sector require government efforts to support a cultural shift away from an individualistic
    and restricted logic of innovation towards one that is collectivistic, community-focused,
    and open-minded. 6.3. Research limitations and future research directions Although
    great care has been taken to ensure the validity and results of the study process,
    some limitations of the employed review process need to be identified, offering
    additional insights for improvement. Firstly, given the need to retrieve structured
    metadata for our investigation, we have included only documents published in the
    WoS database during the initial search, excluding additional databases such as
    Scopus, Google Scholar, and Business Source Complete. Therefore, future research
    may integrate other database results into those offered by this study. In addition,
    future investigation could conduct different types of literature reviews, such
    as bibliometric (Dzikowski, 2018) and structured literature reviews (Massaro et
    al., 2016). Furthermore, we only considered articles and reviews published in
    double-blind peer-reviewed journals and omitted other kinds of publications such
    as conference proceedings, reports, and book chapters. However, given the topic''s
    emergent nature, additional relevant literature from less influential sources
    may offer interesting inputs for future investigation on the latest technological
    applications. For example, future research could use academic sources in conjunction
    with practitioners'' ones, such as the European patent office dataset (Secinaro
    et al., 2021), examining both scientific papers and original validated patents
    to provide holistic insights on how digitalisation is affecting the agri-food
    industry. Finally, we only conducted a descriptive clustering analysis, but different
    analysis can be performed, such as topic modelling. While we have few constraints,
    we contribute to the I4.0 and agri-food sustainability literature by offering
    those interested in focusing on these issues research opportunities. In particular,
    Table 2 offers a robust research agenda, discussing significant insights to be
    explored in future investigations. For example, researchers could develop multiple
    case studies to analyse the impact of I4.0 technologies and sustainable practices
    on food loss and waste reduction, as well as investigate technological factors
    and circular practices affecting foodstuffs'' sustainable consumer behaviour by
    conducting surveys. CRediT authorship contribution statement All authors contributed

  description: Technological breakthroughs have ushered in a revolution in a variety
    of industries, including agriculture, during the last several decades. This has
    given rise to what is now known as Agriculture 4.0, which emphasizes strategy
    and systems rather than the traditional obligations of the past. As a result,
    many human procedures have been replaced by a new generation of intelligent devices.
    Crop production management in Agriculture 4.0, on the other hand, poses a considerable
    challenge, particularly when it comes to prompt and accurate crop disease identification.
    Plant diseases are of special significance since they significantly reduce agricultural
    yield in terms of both quality and quantity. Deep learning neural network models
    are being utilized for early diagnosis of plant diseases in order to overcome
    this difficulty. These models can automatically extract features, generate high-dimensional
    features from low-dimensional ones, and achieve better learning results. In this
    research, we offer a joint solution involving image processing, phytopathology,
    and embedded platforms that intends to minimize the time necessary for human labor
    by leveraging AI to facilitate plant disease detection. We propose a learning-based
    PlantNet architecture for detecting plant diseases from leaf images, in which
    achieved about 97 % accuracy and about 0.27 loss on the PlantVillage dataset.
    However, because putting AI techniques on embedded systems can substantially cut
    energy consumption and processing times while also minimizing the costs and dangers
    involved with data transfer, it is worth considering. The second goal of this
    paper is to use high-level synthesis to accelerate the proposed PlantNet architecture.
    Moreover, we propose a hardware-software (HW/SW) design for integrating the suggested
    vision system on an embedded FPGA-SoC platform. Finally, we present a comparative
    study with state-of-the-art works, which demonstrates that the proposed design
    outperforms the others in terms of normalized GFLOPS (1.93), reduced power consumption
    (2.48 W), and minimum required processing time (0.04 seconds).

    DOI: https://doi.org/10.31577/cai_2023_6_1378 Keywords: FPGA, deep CNN, co-design,
    hardware acceleration, PYNQ-Z1 Abstract Technological breakthroughs have ushered
    in a revolution in a variety of industries, including agriculture, during the
    last several decades. This has given rise to what is now known as Agriculture
    4.0, which emphasizes strategy and systems rather than the traditional obligations
    of the past. As a result, many human procedures have been replaced by a new generation
    of intelligent devices. Crop production management in Agriculture 4.0, on the
    other hand, poses a considerable challenge, particularly when it comes to prompt
    and accurate crop disease identification. Plant diseases are of special significance
    since they significantly reduce agricultural yield in terms of both quality and
    quantity. Deep learning neural network models are being utilized for early diagnosis
    of plant diseases in order to overcome this difficulty. These models can automatically
    extract features, generate high-dimensional features from low-dimensional ones,
    and achieve better learning results. In this research, we offer a joint solution
    involving image processing, phytopathology, and embedded platforms that intends
    to minimize the time necessary for human labor by leveraging AI to facilitate
    plant disease detection. We propose a learning-based PlantNet architecture for
    detecting plant diseases from leaf images, in which achieved about 97 % accuracy
    and about 0.27 loss on the PlantVillage dataset. However, because putting AI techniques
    on embedded systems can substantially cut energy consumption and processing times
    while also minimizing the costs and dangers involved with data transfer, it is
    worth considering. The second goal of this paper is to use high-level synthesis
    to accelerate the proposed PlantNet architecture. Moreover, we propose a hardware-software
    (HW/SW) design for integrating the suggested vision system on an embedded FPGA-SoC
    platform. Finally, we present a comparative study with state-of-the-art works,
    which demonstrates that the proposed design outperforms the others in terms of
    normalized GFLOPS (1.93), reduced power consumption (2.48 W), and minimum required
    processing time (0.04 seconds).     Downloads Author Biography Refka Ghodhbani,

  description: Considering the high-quality requirements related to agricultural crop
    production, the collaborative operation and application influence of sprinkler
    drip irrigation is an important issue in precision agriculture. The objective
    of this review is to give a comprehensive demonstration focusing on the subject
    of collaborative operation and application influence of sprinkler drip irrigation,
    by using a set of comparative analysis and literature bibliometric maps, therefore
    the sprinkler drip irrigation quality considering actual influential factors could
    be determined and analyzed. This review establishes on a broad spectrum of agricultural
    drip irrigation performance, throughout its whole procedure of collaborative monitoring,
    irrigation scheduling, application efficiency, and environmental influence, covering
    such aspects as soil physicochemical quality, irrigation scheduling, water resource
    redistribution, crop productivity, tillage management, climate adaptation, and
    environmental monitoring, etc. This review indicates that, the irrigation efficiency
    and drip infiltration quality of soil field can be planned precisely and allocated
    reasonably by sprinkler drip irrigation, which has extraordinary infiltration
    capability and enables much better performance, than that of other ordinary irrigation
    approaches in accuracy, stability, regularity, and efficiency. Thereafter, the
    investigation on the collaborative operation and application influence of sprinkler
    drip irrigation can be used to ensure the infiltration uniformity of moisture
    distribution, and then the high-quality requirements of practical irrigation performance
    can be met, too. This systematic review facilitates the productive soil-moisture-environment
    management for precision irrigation and agricultural production.

    framework for this purpose should efficiently facilitate structured data storage,
    efficient processing, and robust analytical capabilities [45]. The agricultural
    sector emphasizes precise and timely data, highlighting the necessity of ensuring
    the selected architectural structure is trustworthy and robust. It must have the
    capacity to maintain continuous collection and processing of data, even under
    adverse environmental circumstances or in the presence of challenges with network
    connectivity [46], [47]. On the other hand, ensuring a balanced integration of
    envisioned architectural features, functionalities, and the designated budget
    is essential. This is especially critical for small-scale farmers or financially
    constrained organizations. At the beginning of rapid advancements in IoT technologies,
    it is significant to underscore the importance of selecting an adaptable architectural
    framework [48], [49]. This architecture should incorporate emerging technologies
    and standards, ensuring the enduring relevance and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    SA system without interruption. Emphasizing the need for this strategic preference
    ensures the system’s sustained applicability and efficiency. The architecture
    of IoT technologies is employed based on various methodologies, varying from application
    to application [50], [51], [52]. This results in diverse design and deployment
    patterns. Instead, it must be customized based on specific needs. Typically, architecture
    is structured in a framework comprising three, four, and five layers for SA applications
    [26], [49], [50], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Originating from a hierarchical
    framework of three to five layers, the IoT architecture is conventionally described,
    featuring primary and most common layers, including the perception layer, connectivity
    layer, and application layer for the SA application [20], [33], [50], [57]. These
    layers are also mentioned as the lower layer in the IoT architecture [21]. Furthermore,
    the other layers are the middleware and processing layer [44], [58], [59]. In
    the below subsection, we described the primary and main layer of IoT architecture
    for the SA system. 1) Perception Layer The perception layer, also known as the
    physical layer, is a crucial component in the IoT framework [13], [60]. It operates
    as a robust interface, enabling appropriate interaction between the physical and
    digital domains [33]. This layer is essential for immediately collecting diverse
    data from sensors and devices [44]. It encompasses critical environmental parameters
    such as weather conditions, wind flow, humidity, etc. For example, Zeng et al
    deployed an ultrasonic water level gauge for measuring the water level of a smart
    irrigation system [57]. The perception layer within the SA application presents
    typical challenges due to complex requirements during crop and environmental monitoring,
    especially in unfavorable conditions [60]. Enhancing the energy and communication
    infrastructure in agricultural fields is crucial, and using wired power and communication
    channels to connect IoT nodes is not practical or cost-effective. Data collection
    processes have progressed, integrating various tools. For example, sensors and
    cameras use Bluetooth, wireless networks, and short-distance wireless and wired
    transmission methods to transmit data to the central gateway [1], [61]. The sensing
    layer employs relevant devices to convert biological data into web-accessible
    information, constituting a foundational step in network control. 2) Connectivity
    Layer The communication layer, recognized as the network and transport layer,
    facilitates uninterrupted communication and data transfer across diverse devices,
    constituting the fundamental framework of IoT architectures [62], [63], [64],
    [65]. A profound understanding of the sophistication of the communication layer
    is critical to optimizing IoT networks, fostering scalability, resilience, and
    secure data exchange, thus propelling the potential and applications of IoT technologies
    across various domains. As the key element of the entire system, this layer delivers
    data transmission from the perception layer to the application layers [66]. The
    data transmission channels, encompassing wired or wireless, short or long-distance
    mechanisms, serve as foundational components. These channels effectively utilize
    both network infrastructure and wireless sensors. Attaining consistent and reliable
    performance in data transmission is paramount, especially in light of the substantial
    interference prevalent in the complex agricultural production environment and
    frequent climate changes that continually challenge this technology [67], [68].
    3) Application Layer IoT has revolutionized the SA system, fundamentally transforming
    agriculture and agribusiness approaches. The IoT application layer, central to
    this transformation, drives the functionality and intelligence of IoT applications,
    particularly in intelligent agriculture [69], [70]. This layer integrates data
    from diverse sensors and devices in agricultural settings, enabling insightful
    analysis and informed actions [48], [66]. Advanced technologies within this layer,
    such as ML algorithms and predictive analytics, drive precision farming, optimizing
    resource allocation crop management, and fostering sustainable agricultural practices
    [71]. The application layer processes information and makes critical decisions
    [72]. It closely integrates IoT technology with agricultural production, utilizing
    data analysis from the connectivity layer [73]. It also possesses related equipment
    to achieve SA management [9]. Given the complexity of crop data and climate change,
    technology proves pivotal in identifying agricultural production process issues
    aligning with user needs. B. WSN Architectures WSNs are essential in IoT technology
    because they collect and transmit data from various physical phenomena and environments.
    They operate as the information-gathering infrastructure of IoT by capturing real-time
    data through diverse sensors placed across different locations [74]. This collected
    data is relayed to centralized systems for analysis, interpretation, and informed
    decision-making. Especially within the SA system, WSNs manifest as a connected
    network of sensor nodes utilizing wireless connections. These nodes possess diverse
    functionalities, encompassing processing, transmission, and sensing capabilities,
    empowering them for self-organization, self-configuration, and self-diagnosis
    [75]. The categorization of WSNs is contingent upon their deployment contexts,
    with notable classifications being terrestrial WSNs (TWSNs), wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater WSNs (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks
    (WMSNs), and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [76], [77], [78]. TWSNs and
    UWSNs are commonly utilized in SA applications [23], [79]. In contrast, WUSNs
    are positioned underground, requiring a higher node density due to the restricted
    communication range caused by soil attenuation of higher frequencies [77], [80].
    Scholarly literature extensively explores the various applications of WSNs in
    agriculture, encompassing activities such as managing irrigation, assessing water
    quality, and monitoring the environment. Exploring these applications underscores
    the pivotal role of WSNs in propelling advancements in agricultural practices.
    A WSN typically comprises five foundational layers within its architecture: the
    physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers [81], [82]. The
    details of these layers are given below. 1) Physical Layer The physical layer
    is the foundation of a WSN, encompassing crucial hardware components and communication
    interfaces. In the SA domain, this layer holds various sensors meticulously designed
    to measure essential environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture,
    and sunlight exposure [64], [83]. These sensors play a pivotal role by converting
    these physical parameters into electrical signals, forming the bedrock for comprehensive
    data collection within the agricultural environment. For WSNs, the most relevant
    and widely recognized set of standards is the IEEE 802.15 family [84]. Specifically,
    the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines the physical and Medium access control layer
    (MAC) specifications for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) extensively
    utilized in WSNs [85], [86]. This standard is crafted to deliver low-cost, low-power,
    and low-data rate communication, catering to diverse applications, including WSNs.
    On the other hand, in the data flow, sensor nodes actively collect data and transmit
    it to a centralized node, ensuring processing aligns with user requirements. The
    physical layer is entrusted with transmitting bitstreams, carefully selecting
    frequencies, generating carrier frequencies, modulating data, encrypting data,
    and detecting signals [87]. This layer encompasses the definition of transmission
    medium specifications and intricately involves establishing the network topology,
    incorporating the crucial functions of encoding and decoding signals. 2) Data
    Link Layer The layer above the physical layer is the data link layer, which establishes
    reliable and secure connections between adjacent nodes in the network [81]. In
    the context of SA, this layer ensures error-free communication among sensors,
    the central base station, and sensor nodes, allowing for precise monitoring of
    field conditions and crop health [88], [89]. It handles multiple functions, including
    multiplexing data streams, frame detection, MAC, and error control implementation
    [90]. Additionally, the data link layer ensures the dependability of both point-to-point
    and multi-point channel access strategies through efficient scheduling and proficient
    buffer management [91]. 3) Network Layer The network layer is positioned higher
    within the WSN architecture and is crucial in overseeing routing and data packet
    progression among diverse sensor nodes [92]. It optimizes data flow significantly
    from sensors scattered across extensive farmlands to the central server or gateway,
    making efficient routing a vital aspect for well-informed decisions in SA, particularly
    in irrigation, pest control, and resource management. The network layer’s primary
    function lies in routing, establishing a pathway through intermediary nodes from
    the source to the destination node [93]. Research in this layer primarily focuses
    on developing highly efficient routing protocols that meet various constraints,
    encompassing energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS), and robustness. Moreover,
    the network layer integrates the communication network protocol selected from
    the existing network protocols for WSN, encompassing features relevant to precision
    agriculture applications. 4) Transport Layer The transport layer assumes a critical
    role, ensuring reliability and effectively managing congestion to prevent or mitigate
    it. Specific protocols are in place within this layer to serve these essential
    functions, employing either upstream or downstream techniques [94]. These protocols
    can be categorized as packet-driven and event-driven [95]. The collaborative capabilities
    demonstrated by sensor nodes are the fundamental basis for the operations of this
    vital layer. In addition, the transport layer is crucial in maintaining end-to-end
    communication and data integrity [96]. In the context of advanced agricultural
    applications, this layer can ensure the consistent and reliable transmission of
    data packets from sensors to the application layer. It efficiently manages data
    flow, meticulously maintains packet sequencing, and applies necessary error correction
    measures to ensure that crucial agricultural data reaches the applications with
    the highest accuracy and precision. 5) Application Layer In the domain of SA,
    the application layer holds great significance. It supports various applications
    crucial for optimizing agricultural practices, enhancing yields, and promoting
    sustainable farming methods [97]. Farmers and analysts can easily visualize field
    data on their mobile devices and computers through this layer, aiding in informed
    decision-making. This layer also plays a pivotal role in analyzing field data,
    providing valuable insights [83]. Moreover, the application layer controls essential
    management functionalities within the WSN. It efficiently manages traffic, offers
    software for diverse applications, and converts data into understandable formats.
    These functions encompass network management, query processing, communication,
    time synchronization, and localization [98]. SECTION IV. Wireless Communication
    Protocols for IoT-WSNs in SA WSN developed various wireless sensing devices placed
    over a broad location. These appliances include distributed communication network
    protocols that gather data from the agricultural yield and centralize adequately
    to commission the collected data. The state-of-the-art WSN comprises several affordable
    sensing devices utilizing low-power communications network protocols, such as
    ZigBee, SigFox, WiFi, and LoRaWAN. WSNs are distinguished functionally from the
    usual sensing device collection by their network capabilities, which allow performance
    between sensing assets. The network protocol is also classified into long-range
    and short-range protocols depending on their area coverage and properties. For
    this purpose, long-range network protocols can convey data over a long distance;
    in contrast, short ranges can transmit within a short distance [33], [99]. The
    essential features and attributes of these four protocols are shown in Table 1.
    The short-range and long-range protocols are given below. A. Short-Range Protocols
    1) ZigBee The Alliance has introduced ZigBee technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard, employing a wireless communication approach that conserves power and
    integrates a high-speed, energy-efficient standard protocol [84], [100]. ZigBee
    operates within multiple radio frequency bands, including 2.4 GHz, 915 MHz, and
    868 MHz, achieving an impressive transmission speed of 250 kbps. Notably, ZigBee
    can function in a low-power sleep mode using batteries for extended periods [23].
    It supports various network techniques, encompassing star, tree, and mesh topology,
    resulting in three primary Zigbee network types: star, tree, and wireless mesh
    network topology [101]. Zigbee wireless networks facilitate autonomous wireless
    data transmission in the agricultural IoT-WSNs domain. It ensures convenient and
    stable remote data transmission through successive integration with wired data
    transmission. Continuous advancements in IoT-WSNs microprocessor research and
    development are evident, especially in integrating wireless sensing, control,
    communication, and data processing functions within the microprocessor [27]. Concerning
    real-time monitoring in agricultural production, utilize intelligence systems
    for precise functional and monitoring tasks in field cultivation, irrigation and
    fertilizer, and well-established production processes. Agricultural IoT supports
    enriched planting experiences and precise crop management. Remarkable strides
    have been taken in the development of high-precision information monitoring and
    diagnostic equipment, significantly advancing the application of IoT in agriculture.
    Currently, equipment for acquiring crop and plant information, monitoring environmental
    information, and tracking animal behavior plays a pivotal role in the SA system.
    The vital data required for crop monitoring is gathered using various Zigbee sensors
    in battery self-powered mode, forming a wireless sensor network [102], [103],
    [104]. Given the substantial number of Zigbee nodes required in production, establishing
    a robust network topology is essential to facilitate fast communication between
    network nodes [105]. 2) WiFi Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), officially introduced by
    the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) in the late 1990s [106], [107],
    represented a significant advancement in wireless technology. Functioning as a
    wireless local area network (WLAN) technology, it effectively replaced Ethernet,
    granting devices the ability to connect to the internet without being tethered
    by wires or cables. Operating in compliance with the IEEE 802 communication standard,
    devices equipped with WiFi communicate via radio signals across the airwaves with
    an access point (AP), an essential piece of networking hardware connected to a
    wired or cellular network [108]. This technology covers a range of radio frequencies,
    spanning from 2.4 to 60 GHz, and precisely defines the structure of data packets
    [23], [33]. WiFi is widely adopted across a spectrum of devices, primarily due
    to its coverage range, typically 3–7 km, with a large transmitting antenna and
    its potential to achieve information transfer speeds of up to 700 Mbps [109],
    [110]. In the IoT applied in SA, integrating computing and WiFi-based long-distance
    networks facilitates connectivity within agricultural and farming processes, particularly
    in rural areas. It is used to transmit information within the system due to its
    high throughput and ease of integration with web-based services. WiFi integration
    is essential while measuring critical field parameters such as water quantity,
    soil humidity, and temperature [111]. It is ideal for establishing communication
    between the sink nodes and gateways or connecting to the cloud via the internet.
    WiFi finds specific applications in agricultural IoT, encompassing crop disease
    detection, precision greenhouse farming, and remote diagnosis [112], [113]. B.
    Long-Range Protocols 1) SigFox SigFox is a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    technology designed to transmit minimal data volumes, typically ranging from a
    few bytes to hundreds of kilobytes [114]. The core modulation technique employed
    is Differential Binary Phase-Shift Keying (D-BPSK), operating within a fixed bandwidth
    of 100Hz and achieving efficient spectrum utilization [25], [33]. The transmission
    speed varies, offering rates of 100bps in Europe and a higher 600bps in the U.S.A.
    region. Operating within the unlicensed frequency spectrum below 1GHz, SigFox
    utilizes 868MHz in Europe and 915MHz in the U.S. [115]. This Ultra-Narrow Band
    modulation, known for its minimal power consumption, is ideal for establishing
    robust connections between nodes and the base station, especially when combined
    with the Chirp Spreading Spectrum. The D-BPSK modulation is relatively straightforward
    to implement [116], [117]. Moreover, SigFox handles small data packets, typically
    composed of 12 bytes, and operates within a bandwidth of 100 Hz [118]. A key strength
    of SigFox lies in its outstanding power efficiency, capable of sustaining operations
    for up to an impressive 15 years on a single battery charge [119]. This network
    technology operates in a frequency band between 860 and 920 MHz [120]. The coverage
    range spans 10 to 40 km, and the information transfer speed can reach 600 bits
    per second [121]. Owing to Sigfox’s advanced network protocol features, it finds
    extensive applications within -WSN-based SA systems [7]. It is notably used to
    implement cloud-based WSNs for irrigation systems, real-time agricultural data
    collection, and energy harvesting [118]. Moreover, SigFox has been utilized to
    develop solar-powered autonomous sensor nodes, effectively collecting meteorological
    parameters and demonstrating successful assessment, particularly in vineyard environments
    [118]. 2) LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol developed
    to enable communication among low-energy devices in various IoT applications [101].
    It operates over unlicensed radio frequencies, allowing for long-distance communication
    with minimal power consumption [122]. The technology uses chirp spread spectrum
    modulation, making it ideal for connecting devices over several kilometers in
    urban or rural environments [123]. This wireless communication technology consumes
    energy infrequently and operates in an unlicensed band [124]. Its coverage range
    is about 20 km, and the information transfer speed can reach 100 kbps [125], [126].
    Additionally, LoRaWAN utilizes various spreading factors (SF) from SF7 to SF12,
    strategically managing the trade-off between transmission range and data rate
    [127]. Among them, SF12 achieves an extensive communication range at the cost
    of a lower data rate [128]. LoRa is the fundamental physical technique integrated
    with the LoRaWAN MAC layer, serving as a foundation for various applications [129].
    The architectural design of LoRaWAN nodes is structured into three distinct classes:
    A, B, and C [130]. Class A nodes exhibit minimal power consumption, efficiently
    transmitting a limited number of data packets to the gateway and spending most
    of their time idle [131]. In contrast, Class B nodes, in addition to the reception
    windows resembling Class A, open specific reception windows during scheduled time
    slots [130]. Meanwhile, Class C nodes maintain a perpetually open window for reception,
    except during data transmission, resulting in higher energy consumption than their
    counterparts in the other two classes [132]. SECTION V. IoT-WSNs in SA Application
    Agriculture is essential for any nation and a pillar of the economy. SA is a significant
    aspect and rising contemporary topic for all nations. The world’s inhabitants
    are rapidly increasing, and the demand for food boosts as the population extends.
    The production of food and recovering the individual’s fundamental needs can only
    be possible by concentrating on the agriculture sectors. Thus, automation should
    be incorporated into agriculture and reformed from traditional to SA. For this
    purpose, IoT-WSN is frequently utilized in SA applications. Several agricultural
    applications are discussed In the following subsections. WSN-integrated IoT-based
    SA applications utilizing wireless network protocols are summarised in Table 3.
    TABLE 2 Overview and Characteristics of ZigBee, WiFi, SigFox, and LoRaWAN TABLE
    3 IoT-WSNs-Based Applications With Wireless Network Protocols TABLE 4 A Summary
    of Issues and Challenges of IoT-WSNs Based SA Domain TABLE 5 A Summary of Future
    Perspective and Recommendation for IoT-WSNs-Based SA System A. Irrigation System
    The smart irrigation system (SIS) is a scientific domain that uses data-intensive
    approaches to improve agricultural productivity while decreasing environmental
    impact. Advanced agricultural processes generate data from different sensors,
    leading to a better understanding of the operational circumstances and process
    activities. It allows extra accurate and efficient decision-making. The SIS improves
    performance and is an emerging approach that automates irrigation systems and
    conserves water usage. This process modifies irrigation based on actual soil and
    weather conditions, allowing farmers to fulfill their needs with a recently adopted
    method that preserves the water for the irrigation process. Hence, WSN and wireless
    network protocols are utilized in the irrigation system to achieve this facility
    [133]. Routis et al. have presented an innovative IoT-based prototype system for
    precise crop irrigation. This system utilizes microprocessors and a Single-Board
    Computer (SBC) to collect sensor data, monitoring essential soil parameters, including
    soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) light. A significant
    feature is Raspberry devices, which incorporate powerful 4-core CPUs operating
    at 1.5GHz, underscoring their computational efficiency compared to the Arduino
    UNO’s operation at 16MHz. The system integrates various sensors, including Capacitive
    Soil Moisture sensors, the DHT22 sensor for measuring air humidity and temperature,
    and the VEML6070 UV sensor, which is essential for monitoring UV radiation and
    its influence on crop growth. This study substantially contributes to agricultural
    technology and IoT applications for crop management [201]. Vandome et al. proposed
    low energy consumption and cost-effectiveness wireless soil moisture sensors,
    making them accessible both from a technical and economic perspective. This innovative
    sensor employs a precise calibration method based on a single parameter, enabling
    real-time monitoring of irrigation water requirements. Importantly, it was intentionally
    designed to meet the specific needs of water users and was successfully implemented
    within a Tunisian irrigation scheme, effectively addressing significant water
    use efficiency challenges. They evaluated the sensor by testing the WSN on pilot
    plots throughout a growing season and comparing its performance to commercial
    sensors. Notably, Wi-Fi technology was skillfully employed for communication within
    the network. Furthermore, the authors provided valuable insights by advocating
    for using these cost-effective sensors for real-time irrigation monitoring and
    as a pivotal tool for improving water resource management [283]. Fernández et
    al. proposed an economical cloud-based irrigation system that relies on WSN-based
    micro-controller ESP32-Lora and internet connectivity via the SigFox network.
    The results obtained validate the system’s stability and robustness. This system
    had various sensors to measure different irrigation parameters, encompassing hydraulic
    network and environmental variables, including air temperature, humidity, irradiance,
    wind speed, precipitation, and soil variables such as humidity, temperature, pH,
    and matric potential. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    solution for irrigation control and management, offering scalability suitable
    for diverse agricultural contexts. The deployment of cost-effective SigFox technology
    addresses the connectivity and energy availability challenges of SA systems in
    rural areas [291]. Mathew et al. developed an IoT-based system to enable farmers
    to estimate irrigation water requirements. This innovative system employs sensors
    to detect soil moisture and temperature, with the collected data transmitted to
    the LoRaWAAN system for comprehensive analysis, including evapotranspiration calculation.
    The determination of global evapotranspiration is facilitated through Cropwat
    software, while the sensor data undergoes examination, enabling precise estimations
    tailored to microclimate conditions. The chosen Rx-MCU is the ESP32 MCU, equipped
    with integrated Wi-Fi connectivity to ensure uninterrupted internet gateway connection,
    facilitating seamless data streaming into application layer services. This approach
    is firmly grounded in WSNs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of both data
    collection and transmission [284]. B. Soil Moisture Monitoring System Soil moisture
    plays an important role in an agricultural field that massively contributes to
    crop growth [493], [494]. It is recognized as one of the major drivers for plant
    ecosystems and a significant state variable for the irrigation system of the agriculture
    field [495]. Soil moisture is strongly variable and depends on various soil properties
    and terrain attributes [496]. Therefore, a modern, sustainable, automatic, low-cost,
    and power-efficient soil moisture monitoring process is required. Soil moisture
    monitoring systems can be performed with various procedures. In these terms, WSN
    is one of the most utilized approaches to monitoring soil condition and moisture
    [84], [497]. Based on this, several works have been done to monitor the soil nutrient,
    PH, and moisture monitoring by using WSN. Mohammed et al. introduced a real-time,
    fully automated WSN prototype for irrigation systems. This innovative system relies
    on automated WSN technology to respond to soil conditions, particularly soil moisture,
    for informed irrigation decisions. It utilizes the ZigBee protocol integrated
    into the XBee module and incorporates a cost-effective capacitive soil moisture
    sensor to measure soil moisture levels at each ZigBee node. Integrated with the
    low-cost soil moisture sensor, this system demonstrated promise in enhancing agricultural
    practices and conserving water resources [203]. Patrizi et al. submitted WSN architecture
    that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technology to develop a virtual soil
    moisture sensor. This virtual sensor utilizes data collected by other transducers
    on the same node. They utilized the ESP32 system-on-a-chip microcontroller to
    efficiently process and transmit data to a centralized gateway through the WiFi
    protocol. The WSN consists of ten independent sensor nodes, each equipped with
    an array of environmental sensors for air temperature, humidity, soil temperature,
    soil moisture, and radiation. An essential challenge addressed in this work was
    measuring soil humidity. In response, the study introduced a sophisticated soft
    sensing algorithm based on the DL algorithm, resulting in a virtual soil moisture
    sensor capable of overcoming the limitations of physical sensors and enhancing
    precision in soil moisture measurements [379]. Wu et al. presented a soil quality
    monitoring system to enhance agricultural practices. This system designated users
    to conduct real-time monitoring of their farmland via a mobile application, providing
    a convenient means to establish and customize soil parameter thresholds. Their
    research offered a novel approach to integrating IoT technology into agricultural
    soil measurements, incorporating multiple sensors for temperature and moisture,
    a microprocessor, a microcomputer, a cloud platform, and a dedicated mobile application.
    The wireless sensors efficiently collect and transmit real-time soil information,
    with the mobile app serving as a central monitoring hub through the cloud platform.
    Data transmission facilitated by the LoRa module ensures precise measurements
    that closely align with those obtained through calibration equipment. Field experiments
    have showcased the system’s ability to predict soil moisture and temperature with
    enhanced accuracy, drawing upon data from various soil layers. This system equipped
    users with the necessary tools to promptly assess soil conditions, enabling routine
    checks for changes in soil quality [406]. C. Fertiliser Optimization and Control
    The world faces a food supply crisis, with less food production than population
    growth [498]. Besides, there needs to be more integration and utilization of state-of-the-art
    technology in agricultural applications [499]. The annual food production is also
    damaged due to a lack of soil fertility, moisture, and fundamental nutrients of
    NPK [500]. On the other hand, conventional methods are even applied to measure
    the soil nutrients and apply a fertilizer that is also harmful to crops and soil.
    The excessive volume of fertilizer can damage the standard scale of PH and the
    soil nutrition of agricultural land [501]. To address this challenge, it becomes
    essential to form a precision agriculture exercise through IoT with the involvement
    of IoT and WSN. Soil nutrient and fertilizer investigation using WSN allows different
    applications, including remote soil fertility monitoring. Contreras et al. introduced
    SAgric-IoT, an SA system integrating IoT and DL technologies. This sophisticated
    system aims to monitor environmental conditions, swiftly detect diseases, and
    automate irrigation and fertilization processes within greenhouses. It comprises
    four key components: WSN for environmental monitoring, cameras for visual data,
    a gateway for centralized control, and a processing and storage unit. The gateway
    operates using three distinct communication protocols–ZigBee for sensor connectivity,
    Wi-Fi for cameras, and a cellular interface for transmitting data to the central
    unit. Notably, SAgric-IoT demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing packet
    loss, thereby significantly conserving energy [105]. Senapaty et al. introduced
    the IoTSNA-CR model, utilizing IoT technology to analyze soil nutrients and suggest
    optimal crops, aiming to enhance productivity while reducing fertilizer usage.
    The model begins with IoT sensors collecting data in cultivation areas, followed
    by real-time storage in cloud services, accessible via an Android app, and undergoing
    subsequent data processing and analysis. A cost-effective WSN sensory system integrated
    various sensors to monitor soil attributes—temperature, moisture, pH, GPS, and
    color—efficiently gathering diverse data, including NPK values, timestamps, and
    geolocation specifics. Research advised using Agrinex NPK soil testing tablets
    and an LDR color sensor for soil sample analysis, with results stored in Firebase
    cloud storage. Interconnected through the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and Arduino microcontroller,
    sensor nodes formed a low-power, efficient wireless network. The pivotal FC28
    soil moisture sensor significantly enhanced the IoTSNA-CR model’s effectiveness
    by evaluating soil water content [112]. Doan et al. proposed a WSN framework employing
    LoRa technology for remote monitoring within agricultural settings. This network
    consisted of three strategically placed LoRa sensor nodes within separate rice
    fields, tailored to different crops and utilizing various tillage and fertilization
    methods. These nodes gathered essential environmental indicators for effective

    Damaging crop production due to various factors, pests, and crop diseases is one
    significant issue, as a large quantity of crop is wasted every production cycle
    by affecting pests and diseases [84], [502]. Thus, an early-stage sustainable
    decision support system is mandatory to enable the farmer to carry out proper
    actions in profitable harvesting [503]. A smart monitoring system should employ
    state-of-the-art sensor technology to solve plant diseases and pest-related concerns.
    WSN systems can collect data and store them in a cloud platform with the help
    of network protocols and process them, which helps to make early decisions to
    prevent pest and crop diseases [36], [47]. Additionally, Crop disease detection
    is a massive challenge in precision agriculture applications since crop diseases
    cannot be accurately predicted by analyzing individual disease causes. Azfar et
    al. introduced an IoT sensor system explicitly designed for pest detection and
    control, real-time detection of Cotton Flying Moths. This system experienced rigorous
    testing in controlled and uncontrolled environments to evaluate its accuracy and
    efficiency. The innovative prototype integrated a series of precise infrared sensors,
    a communication module based on Zigbee technology, an Arduino 2560 Mega board,
    a lithium polymer battery to power the sensor, a gateway device, and a UAV configured
    to act as a pesticide sprayer upon detecting pests. The pest detection algorithm,
    embedded within the system, monitors changes in reflected light to identify the
    presence of flying insects. Upon detection, the system sends an alert to the gateway
    device, which transmits the detection coordinates to the drone/UAV. Subsequently,
    the drone responds by spraying pesticide in the identified pest-infested area
    [440]. Strawberry cultivation is a significant agricultural venture, offering
    considerable advantages over various vegetable crops [504], [505]. Despite its
    prominence, the sensitivity of strawberries renders them highly susceptible to

    paired with a LoRaWAN-based system designed precisely for intelligently detecting
    grapevine diseases and collecting essential environmental and plant-related data.
    This technology was deployed within the experimental plots of the Research Station
    for Viticulture and Enology (SDV) to offer early insights into grapevine health.
    Data transmission across the Wi-Fi network was facilitated through the LoRaWAN-EU868
    protocol. The study is balanced to extend its investigation to analyze results
    from IoT sensors trialed across vineyards in diverse regions [446]. E. Energy

    conventional energy harvesting strategy cannot serve under such a requirement
    while harvesting and thus may reduce the overall lifespan of the network and entire
    system. To meet the energy requirements, a significant energy harvesting design
    is required [508]. Recent advancements and development of technology with low-power
    consumption, IoT, and WSN have been tremendously utilized and deployed for various
    SA applications. WSN has improved agricultural productivity and efficiency in
    agriculture yield. However, the energy and power shortage of WSNs is a major issue
    as instantly charging batteries is usually demanded [509], [510], [511], [512].
    Sadowski et al. proposed an agricultural monitoring system with energy harvesting
    regarding these factors. The study presented a comparison arrangement between
    ZigBee, WiFi, and LoRaWAN wireless network protocols. It has been demonstrated
    that LoRaWAN demanded less power than other protocols within agricultural monitoring
    systems where power consumption and legibility of the network are considered.
    The experimental results recommended selecting wireless technology for future
    agricultural monitoring applications [464]. Similarly, Arshad et al. introduced
    a study based on a smart sensor module with an advanced irrigation system and
    supervised fertilizer architectures. The system has incorporated WSN, cloud-utilizing
    decision support layers, and networking-based DSS to recommend cautiousness for
    optimum sustainable agricultural field and production. For this purpose, A WSN
    node is equipped with an MCU LoRaWAN wireless module. The sensor node with LoRaWAN
    is connected to solar panels for stored energy since LoRaWAN can achieve enormous
    distances with low energy [267], [403]. SECTION VI. Issues and Challenges of IoT-WSNs-Based

    ahead, 6G technology, still in its developmental phase, holds the potential to
    revolutionize data collection and analysis, potentially achieving speeds in the
    range of terabits per second, thereby ensuring exceptionally timely and precise
    insights for farmers [628], [631]. Incorporating 5G and the envisioned capabilities
    of 6G within IoT-WSNs for agriculture holds immense promise. This combination
    facilitates real-time monitoring of critical factors such as soil conditions,
    crop health, weather patterns, and equipment performance, empowering optimized
    decision-making. The present generation of intelligent agricultural applications,
    relying on a relatively restrained number of wireless sensors, necessitates improved
    accuracy and effectiveness. However, the ongoing development of 6G- communication
    technologies sets the groundwork for the future of intelligent and sustainable
    agriculture [629]. 6G- technology pledges to enable the interconnection of various
    extensive sensors, granting farmers the capacity to gather intricate, plant-specific
    information. This transformative potential fueled by 6G- technology is poised
    to revolutionize SA, ensuring precise data collection, advanced robotics, and
    precision agriculture in remote locations, rendering agriculture significantly
    more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective. G. Block Chain Systems Blockchain
    technology, a decentralized and highly secure digital ledger, plays a crucial
    role in documenting transactions across a network. When integrated with IoT-WSNs,
    it ensures secure and transparent record-keeping within the domain of SA, particularly
    benefiting supply chains, traceability, and transactions. This integration significantly
    strengthens trust and operational efficiency throughout the agricultural ecosystem
    by assuring data integrity and fortifying defense against potential threats. One
    notable application involves countering data manipulation attacks, where crucial
    information about crops with minimal pesticide usage is securely stored within
    the blockchain’s immutable ledger [627], [634], [635]. This advancement ensures
    the integrity and reliability of essential agricultural data, ultimately contributing
    to enhanced decision-making processes. H. Renewable Energy Integration Incorporating
    renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power into IoT-WSNs for agriculture
    is crucial, aiming to establish sustainable and environmentally friendly energy
    solutions for powering devices and systems in remote agricultural regions [63].
    Integrating renewable energy contributes to energy efficiency and environmental
    sustainability within the agricultural landscape. By incorporating energy from
    renewable sources into the IoT-based SA observation systems, sustainability and
    cost-effectiveness are markedly enhanced [637]. Using solar or wind power to energize
    the system diminishes reliance on conventional power sources, consequently reducing
    energy expenses and decreasing carbon emissions. Additionally, the scalability
    of this integrated system makes it viable for adoption by small-scale farmers
    who may lack access to conventional power sources. I. IoT-WSNs and Their Protocols
    in Future SA Applications Areas In recent years, the integration of the IoT has
    led to significant advancements in agriculture, as shown in Table 3. Notably,
    there has been a 2.4% increase in IoT’s growth, currently rising by 1.5%, as shown
    in Figure 4, which has captured substantial attention within the agricultural
    community. Farmers have extensively adopted IoT frameworks throughout the agricultural
    process, particularly in irrigation systems. They are renowned for their precision,
    efficiency, remote monitoring, and data-driven decision-making, as shown in Figure
    5. FIGURE 4. Progression of IoT-WSNs and network protocols in SA systems. Show
    All FIGURE 5. Yearly evolution of research contributions in IoT-WSN within SA
    applications. Show All IoT has notably enhanced agricultural efficiency by linking
    devices, instruments, and stakeholders, reducing labor costs and increasing overall
    productivity. Farmers seek reliable, cost-effective, and power-efficient IoT devices
    seamlessly integrating with WSNs. The landscape of wireless network protocols
    is evolving, witnessing a significant shift towards low-power alternatives such
    as LoRaWAN, outperforming Wi-Fi due to its efficiency, network coverage, and minimal
    power requirements in SA, as shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6. Research contribution
    distribution in IoT-WSN with their network protocols in SA applications. Show
    All Moreover, SigFox, operating on narrowband technology and offering extensive
    coverage with fewer base stations, remains an area of interest for IoT research
    in agricultural systems. Although its usage has maintained a 1% rate since 2019,
    as shown in Figure 6, SigFox and LoRaWAN, both with low power consumption, differ
    in flexibility. LoRaWAN, due to its greater flexibility, is better suited for
    specific agricultural setups requiring increased control or distinct coverage
    patterns. A detailed analysis of research contributions emphasizes a significant
    focus on irrigation systems, soil monitoring, and energy optimization. Soil monitoring
    saw a slight decrease post-2021, while by the end of 2022, as shown in Figure
    7, there was an increase in fertilizer optimization through IoT, along with applications
    for energy savings and plant pest and disease control in SA. Regarding network
    protocols, the rise of LoRaWAN significantly impacted the dominance of ZigBee
    and Wi-Fi from 2020 to 2022, securing a 35% share over the past five years, as
    shown in Figure 8. This positions LoRaWAN as a promising protocol for efficient
    resource utilization in SA. Simultaneously, Wi-Fi retains its popularity due to
    widespread availability and short-range capabilities. FIGURE 7. Annual research
    contribution rates in SA application areas. Show All FIGURE 8. Annual wireless

    agricultural processes. This comprehensive IoT with WSNs architecture facilitates
    effective monitoring and control of agricultural fields, enabling valuable data
    collection to address current challenges. Wireless communication protocols are
    essential in efficiently transmitting the collected data to the system. Integrating
    WSNs with IoT and wireless network protocols has proven cost-effective and efficient
    in SA applications, minimizing agricultural expenses. Notably, these integrated
    systems exhibit low cost, low power consumption, and enhanced efficiency. This
    survey presents a detailed review of the state-of-the-art IoT technology and the
    deployment of WSNs with wireless network protocols for SA applications since 2019.

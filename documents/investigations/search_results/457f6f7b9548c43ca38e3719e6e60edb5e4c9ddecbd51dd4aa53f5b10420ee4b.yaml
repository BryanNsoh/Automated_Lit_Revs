  description: Restriction of water resources requires optimal use of agricultural
    water resources. In this regard, the use of new technology may increase irrigation
    efficiency. In arid and extremely arid regions such as Iran, the time and duration
    of irrigation is the key to achieving sustainable irrigation. Therefore, in this
    research, after constructing a garden in Iran, Karaj, Imam Khomeini Higher Education
    Center with an area of 0.05 ha, and installing equipment related to irrigation
    and fertilization, a fuzzy control system was designed to optimize water consumption
    and inputs, intelligent irrigation and fertilization system. The present study
    presents a practical solution based on artificial intelligence in which all stages
    of design and implementation are described. In this system, a microcontroller
    was first used to process and store data on soil moisture, ambient temperature
    and solar radiation. The fuzzy logic controller then takes these three inputs
    and based on the table of rules created for a specific product, produces the desired
    irrigation time and duration. Experimental results showed that, the developed
    system accurately compensates for the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration.
    It seems that the use of fuzzy control has a great impact on irrigation management
    and planning in the near future.

    Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction Agriculture is considered a vital sector in most
    of the country’s food production. But it has to face numerous challenges to increase
    sustainability. The reasonable utilization of natural resources and environmental
    degradation, climate changes are some of the major challenges to be faced in agriculture.
    So it is extremely important to practice smart agriculture methodologies to overcome
    the challenges. IoT in agriculture or farming has to provide useful and valid
    information such as weather conditions, soil characteristics, fertilizer needs,
    seasonal suggestions for plantation, etc., to the farmer to increase productivity
    [1]. Since farming requires proper knowledge as the environmental changes are
    unpredictable. Most of the farmers are lag in farming knowledge and this leads
    to a huge loss. Conventional farming methods are mainly based on prediction and
    forecasting and if it fails the losses should be possessed by the farmers. Quality
    of soil, air, irrigation, temperature are the major factors that either increase
    or decrease the productivity in agriculture. By sensing, identifying, and monitoring
    these factors IoT systems are introduced as smart agriculture that not only enhances
    the farming activities and reduces the time cost of farmers [2]. Smart agriculture
    is seemed to be a key enabler in eliminating world hunger, but the practical realization
    and adoption of smart systems are still a challenging task. IoT systems reduce
    the challenges in conventional agriculture techniques [3]. Internet of things
    is an emerging technology that connects applications from different segments through
    sensors and other devices using the internet. Automatic data collection reduces
    manual requirements and makes life simple. smart city, smart transportation, etc.,
    are some of the important domains of IoT. Recently, IoT is adopted in farming
    to collect environmental data. So that better decisions can be obtained in farming
    which could reduce the losses to the farmers [4]. Figure 1 depicts the role of
    IoT in smart farming. The structure of IoT as smart farming has three structure
    which includes a sensor layer, transport layer, and application layer. The sensor
    layer is used to obtain real-time information from the field and transform the
    data digitally to simplify the analysis process. Generally, data are collected
    from sensors such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, pressure sensors,
    etc., Sensor layer has to handle diverse data using real word sensing techniques
    and transfer the data to the processing system [5]. For data transfer, a transport
    layer is used which collects all the data from the sensors. The transport layer
    is important in IoT applications and it includes an active internet, communication
    center, and data processing centers. Finally, the application layer is used to
    analyze the collected information and provides the decision to the user. It is
    considered as a fusion of IoT and intelligence systems that clearly presents the
    analysis results to the farmer. The objective of the research work is to provide
    innovative smart technology to farmers to avoid manual intervention. Better water
    management strategy to increase crop productivity. Integrated module to analyze
    the environmental parameters through remote application to relieve farmers from
    conventional farming practices. Fig. 1 Role of IoT in Smart Farming Full size
    image 2 Related Works Smart agriculture techniques gain more attention in the
    past few years and various research works suggested innovative methodologies to
    improve the yields by analyzing the soil characteristics, climate conditions,
    water management strategies, seed classification, disease identification etc.,
    This section provides an overview of existing research models and discusses the
    methodologies to identify the technical innovations along with merits and demerits.
    User centric IoT architecture reported in literature [6] addresses the issues
    in the agriculture sector and provides a smart monitoring system to monitor the
    fields in real time. Depends on the climatic condition, soil characteristics,
    essential recommendations are delivered to the farmers to increase the cultivation
    with quality crops. The optimization process introduced in the architecture increases
    the overall profit for the farmers by considering the various aspects of agriculture.
    Smart agriculture systems must adopt climatic conditions to obtain high yield.
    Proper prediction and cultivation reduce losses to the farmers. Similarly, environmental
    degradation issues such as the utilization of nitrogen fertilizers, overutilization
    of groundwater will lead to issues in the upcoming years. A multi-objective assessment
    and optimization model introduced in literature [7] provides alternative cropping
    suggestions to reduce the environmental degradation factors. Water utilization,
    nitrogen fertilizer utilization, evapotranspiration, carbon footprint, groundwater
    recharge is considered as major factors to evaluate the smart agriculture system.
    Climate smart agriculture reported in literature [8] [9] describes the realities
    in climate changes and utilization of scarce resources. Multi-dimensional nature
    that includes productivity, adaption and mitigation, climate impacts and their
    uncertainties, temporal and scale dependencies are considered in the climate smart
    agriculture assessment process to address the issues in smart agriculture. Integrated
    biophysical agricultural models support farmers in terms of food sufficiency,
    employment targets, income security, and climate assessments [10]. Moreover, climate
    smart agriculture scaling helps to analyze the seed systems, rice varieties to
    improve the yields compared to conventional farming techniques [11]. In order
    to monitor the smart agriculture environment, wireless sensor nodes are utilized
    but the energy requirement is considered as the major issue while implementing
    wireless sensor networks. To reduce these issues, energy harvesting techniques
    are introduced to harness the energy from natural resources [12]. Various factors
    like available power, solar panel conversion efficiency, and energy prediction
    factors are considered in the research model to improve the lifetime of sensor
    nodes. Low power wireless networks in smart agriculture introduced in literature
    [13] utilize smart mesh internet protocol techniques to obtain sensor data and
    provide network statistics. Time slotted channel hopping is used in the network
    topology to obtain stable links which make the system suitable for smart agriculture
    applications. Later IoT based applications are introduced to integrate multiple
    domains under roof. IoT can integrate wireless sensor networks, cloud computing,
    and end-user applications [14]. Based on that a multilevel data fusion introduced
    in literature [15] provides a smart irrigation application is based on the moisture
    level of the soil and estimating the water evaporation and plant transpiration
    rate to improve the sensor accuracy, target events identification, and improves
    the decision accuracy. IoT module introduced in the fusion architecture consists
    of three layers such as fusion of sensor data in the low level, decision making
    at the middle level, and decision fusion in the top level. Machine learning based
    wireless sensor networks reported in literature [16] estimates the soil condition
    for smart agriculture system. Initially, wireless sensor networks are used to
    estimate the soil condition followed by IoT and cloud communication protocols
    the spatial distribution of soil parameters are estimated. The artificial neural
    network model used in the system estimates the phosphorus level in the soil that
    reduces the time-consuming laboratory analysis and its requirements. precision
    agriculture balances the energy requirement of nodes and estimates the phosphorus
    level with improved accuracy better than conventional techniques. Nanotechnology-based
    (bio)sensors and their importance in smart agriculture are reported in the literature
    [17] to reduce the disadvantages in agricultural practices that affect the environment.
    Considering the global impact and climate changes nanotechnology-based biosensors
    support smart agriculture systems to obtain quick and accurate results cost-effectively
    by analyzing the humidity and nutrients in the soil. Water management in agriculture
    is an essential process that is directly related to food production. Depends on
    the availability of water resources, the ability of production is defined in agriculture.
    Wireless sensor networks, Internet of things based applications are introduced
    to improve the quantity and quality of crops and to minimize the human intervention
    needs. Automatic water management techniques and their challenges are addressed
    in literature [18] discussed the recent innovations and their processes in detail
    in terms of water reuse strategies, distributed networks for irrigation, water
    pollution in the agriculture domain. Deep reinforcement learning-based smart agricultural
    IoT system introduced in literature [5] reduces the water requirements and increases
    production. Artificial intelligence and cloud computing techniques are integrated
    into the research work provides better water management strategies by analyzing
    the crop growth. Learning based irrigation system provides adequate water to the
    crops and reduces the excess water requirements. Fuzzy logic based smart irrigation
    system is reported in literature [19] considered as a better decision support
    system for smart agriculture. Based on fuzzy rule sets the farmer’s experience
    and best practices are formulated and a context aware optimized irrigation schedule
    is framed based on the outputs of crop and soil models [20]. proposed system reduces
    the water requirements and improves the yield based on the weather and water needs.
    Network gateway makes the system into an autonomous decision support system and
    improves the results without affecting the crop quality. Recently, fog computing
    and Wi-Fi-based smart farming system for long distance IoT networks are introduced
    to connect the rural areas efficiently [21]. Greenhouse farming strategies are
    introduced to manage the food supply and sustainability in agriculture using IoT.
    Climate control, crop growth monitoring, and harvesting can be managed through
    IoT and decision support systems in greenhouse farming [22]. Monitoring and controlling
    farms in rural areas can be connected to improve the farming solutions as an intelligent
    approach. Other than network parameters such as reliability and lifetime, Intelligent
    architecture improves the production efficiency in agriculture using IoT. A connected
    cooperative ecosystem reported in the literature [23] defines sensor communication
    under different entities. Cloud integrated module collects and analyzes the data
    and generates artificial intelligence-supported insights for farmers. Sensors
    play a vital role in smart agriculture systems. The real-time data are generated
    in batches and it is used to analyze so that perfect decisions can be obtained
    [24]. A neural network model reported in [25] analyzes the sensor data and provides
    an intelligent solution as classification results for the efficient drip irrigation
    system. However, the number of data obtained from the sensors is huge in volume,
    and processing all the data consumes more time. So, optimization methods are introduced
    in sensor data analysis. Optimization approaches are used in various applications.
    In the case of smart agriculture, an optimization model reported in [26] utilized
    a cuckoo search algorithm to select the optimal water requirement for the farms
    considering the parameters such as humidity, temperature, and moisture level.
    IoT platform is used to collect the data and the Thingspeak cloud is used to display
    the collected details. The utilization of IoT as smart farming reduces the issues
    faced by the farmers and reduces the wastage cost and increases the revenue [27].
    An analysis made in literature [28] discusses the issues in conventional farming
    and the merits of IoT-based farming. The communication module developed by the
    researchers generates messages over different platforms and informs the farmers
    on time so that necessary steps can be taken by securing the existing resources.
    The major issues in conventional irrigation systems that affect the production
    in agriculture are considered in [29] to develop the proposed smart irrigation
    system. The presented Arduino-based smart irrigation model includes a machine
    learning algorithm to analyze the data from IoT sensors and maintains the water
    level in fields based on weather conditions. Recently an energy-efficient water
    management platform is reported in [30] as an enhanced version of the Smart water
    management platform (SWAMP). The presented IoT-based irrigation system reduces
    energy consumption and enhances network stability better than a traditional smart
    water management platform. The presented approach is well suitable for drip irrigation,
    surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, etc., The intelligent irrigation system
    reported in [31] for paddy crop fields integrates IoT to define the soil condition.
    The parameters like soil moisture and pH are measured through sensors and transferred
    to a web server database for further processing. Based on the decisions from the
    web server the pumps will be operated to maintain the desired water flow to the
    field. The precision agriculture model reported in [32] employs deep learning
    techniques with IoT to enhance the performance of irrigation systems. The presented
    approach includes a long short-term memory network (LSTM) for predicting the soil
    moisture content one day before the irrigation period so that water utilization
    is greatly managed compared to existing models. The smart irrigation model presented
    in [33] provides an automated remotely controlled system to maintain the water
    level in the farm. The remotely controlled robot was developed to measure the
    soil condition and crop status. The data obtained from the robot are processed
    through the application developed in smartphone and decisions can be made to enhance
    the production [34,35,36]. From the above survey, it is observed that most of
    the research works are focused on a few parameters such as humidity and temperature
    for smart agriculture systems. Machine learning models are used as a decision
    support system in few research works. Considering this research observation, this
    research work presents an integrated module that includes smart monitoring and
    smart irrigation system using interconnected IoT devices such as UV sensor, Humidity
    sensor, temperature sensor, light intensity sensor, soil moisture sensor along
    with water management system. The novel approach introduced in the research work
    provides a complete smart model for farmers. 3 Proposed Work Conventional farming
    methodologies require more human interventions for irrigation activities. This
    includes manpower, and a time-consuming process needs to be monitored continuously
    to avoid waste overflow. Due to manual errors, irrigation at proper times is also
    missed, which affects the overall yield. So, to overcome this, a smart irrigation
    system is used. Sensors are widely used in various applications. In the case of
    agriculture, the utilization of sensors will introduce huge changeover and avoid
    losses. An IoT based smart agriculture system collects information through sensors
    and processes the collected information through a learning model to predict the
    water requirements. Based on the analysis results, the drip irrigation system
    provides water and cuts off the flow if it reaches the desired level. Machine
    learning models are widely used to predict and classify sensor data, and in this
    research work, a learning model is combined with fuzzy logic to obtain logical
    decisions and efficient prediction so that irrigation can be managed effectively.
    The proposed smart agriculture module consists of two phases. In the first phase,
    different sensors such as UV sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, light
    intensity sensor, soil moisture sensor are used to collect essential environmental
    data as an IoT application. In the second phase, based on the collected data,
    a smart irrigation system is developed to manage the water requirements of the
    crops. Figure 2 depicts the overall process flow of the proposed IoT-based smart
    agriculture module along with a control system for smart irrigation system. Wireless
    data transmission is incorporated to monitor the fields remotely using the application.
    A microcontroller is used to connect all the sensors and the collected information
    are analyzed using one-dimensional recurrent neural network model to obtain essential
    decision. Fig. 2 Overview of Proposed IoT based smart agriculture Module Full
    size image 3.1 Sensor data analysis using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) In deep
    learning models, the convolutional neural network is widely adopted in various
    image processing applications. However, for real time, time series data analysis
    recurrent neural networks (RNN) will be the best choice. Since RNN considers the
    present state and previous state values to obtain a decision. The results of RNN
    will be reliable compared to other models. RNN is used in the proposed smart agriculture
    model to analyze the sensor data. So that based on the decision smart irrigation
    system will start to work. RNN is another type of neural network which is similar
    to an artificial neural network with cyclic connections to each unit. Unlike simple
    machine language models that map input into output, RNN makes use of previous
    inputs for each output to describe the states along with network parameters. The
    process in a recurrent neural network for single sensor time series data is formulated
    and similar steps is followed for all the data collected through sensors. Consider
    a time series data \\( X=\\left({x}_{1},{x}_{2}, {x}_{3}\\dots , {x}_{n} \\right)\\)
    to RNN, first, the input data is compressed into fixed dimensional vectors. The
    recursion function is used to compress the data into a vector and this vector
    function enables the system to deal with the input and output lengths. The history
    of all the vector before the present state is considered as \\( {h}_{t-1}\\).
    Now the RNN will compute the internal state as a new vector by compressing all
    the previous states. Based on this the new symbol is obtained as $$ {X}_{t}=\\left({x}_{1},{x}_{2},
    {x}_{3}\\dots , {x}_{t-1} \\right)$$ (1) The internal state is defined as $$ {h}_{t}=\\text{tanh}\\left({WMX}_{t}+{RWh}_{t-1}+b\\right)$$
    (2) The output state is defined as $$ {\\widehat{Y}}_{t}=softmax \\left(U{h}_{t}\\right)$$
    (3) where the input weight matrix is represented as \\( WM\\), recurrent weight
    matrix is represented as \\( RW\\), the hidden layer weight function is represented
    as \\( U\\) and the bias vector is represented as \\( b\\). Figure 3 depicts the
    recurrent neural network model with one hidden layer for different time stamps.
    Fig. 3 Recurrent Neural Network model with one hidden layer for different time
    stamps Full size image To train the RNN module, backpropagation algorithm is employed
    in the proposed work. The parameters are defined as timestamps to the network
    and the output depends on the current stamp and previous stamp. So in order to
    backpropagate, the gradients of errors should be obtained based on the network
    parameters. Chain rule for differentiation is incorporated to obtain the error
    gradients and it is expressed as $$ \\frac{\\partial {h}_{t}}{\\partial U}=\\frac{\\partial
    {h}_{t}}{\\partial {\\widehat{Y}}_{t}}*\\frac{\\partial {\\widehat{Y}}_{t}}{\\partial
    U}=\\left({\\widehat{Y}}_{t}-{Y}_{t}\\right)\\otimes {h}_{t}$$ (4) The above function
    \\( \\frac{\\partial {h}_{t}}{\\partial U}\\) depends on the current timestamp
    values such as \\( {\\widehat{Y}}_{t}\\), \\( {Y}_{t}\\) and \\( {h}_{t}\\). The
    previous state gradients are expressed as $$ \\frac{\\partial {h}_{t}}{\\partial
    WM}=\\sum _{j=0}^{t}\\frac{\\partial {h}_{t}}{\\partial {\\widehat{Y}}_{t}}\\frac{\\partial
    {\\widehat{Y}}_{t}}{\\partial {H}_{t}}\\left(\\prod _{i=j+1}^{t}\\frac{\\partial
    {h}_{i}}{\\partial {h}_{i-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial {h}_{j}}{\\partial WM}$$
    (5) The chain rule is presented by the inner product in Eq. (5) for the limit
    \\( j\\). For each timestamp, the gradients are added. The final results of Eq.
    (5) result into error function partial derivatives. 3.2 Smart Irrigation System
    using fuzzy controller Based on the results of sensor data analysis using a recurrent
    neural network, suitable irrigation plan was suggested to implement the smart
    water management system. Fuzzy controller is utilized to control the motor operations
    which includes the amount of water required, estimated time to complete the irrigation,
    etc., Compared to conventional controllers, the performance of fuzzy controllers
    are better and it is widely adopted in various industrial applications. Figure
    4 depicts the sample illustration of the fuzzy logic controller. Fig. 4 Process
    in Fuzzy controller Full size image To obtain the membership function, triangular
    or trapezoidal functions are selected and rules are formulated using a simple
    Mamdani system. Soil temperature, soil moisture, humidity data is considered for
    the drip irrigation system. The rules are framed based on IF-AND-THEN conditions
    so that the irrigation system motor can be switched on and off. Table 1 describes
    the fuzzy rules used in the proposed controller model in detail. Table 1 Fuzzy
    logic Rules Full size table The membership function for temperature is depicted
    in Fig. 5. Four conditions are observed for temperature such as Cold, Normal,
    Hot and Very Hot. Fig. 5 Membership function for Temperature Full size image Similarly,
    the membership function for humidity and soil moisture is observed for three conditions
    such as high, medium and low, dry, humid and wet respectively. Figure 6 depicts
    the membership function for humidity and Fig. 7 depicts the membership function
    for soil moisture. Fig. 6 Membership function for humidity Full size image Fig.
    7 Membership function for soil moisture Full size image The membership function
    for the drip irrigation system is depicted in Fig. 8. Three conditions are observed
    as final membership function in terms of duration such as short, medium, and long
    duration irrigation based on the humidity, temperature, and moisture levels. Integrating
    fuzzy logic and recurrent neural network for sensor data analysis in IoT based
    smart agriculture is not performed earlier which is the novelty of the proposed
    work. Fig. 8 Membership function Irrigation system Full size image 3.3 Hardware
    Implementation The hardware used in the proposed design implementation is listed
    in table Table 2. The entire process is divided into four layers, such as the
    application layer, processing layer, transporation layer, and perception layer.
    In this, the sensors are assembled to collect data as a physical or perception
    layer. Sensors such as UV, temperature, humidity, and light intensity sensors
    are used in the implementation. The transport layer is responsible for transmitting
    the data to the server for further processing. The transmission is processed through
    GSM. The processing layer is responsible for analyzing and storing the data transferred
    through the transport layer. Table 2 Sensors description Full size table The hardware
    setup used in the proposed IoT based smart agriculture is depicted in Fig. 9.
    The simple prototype includes the sensors and Arduino UNO to collect the data.
    The collected data are transmitted through GSM module SIM808. All the transferred
    data are received at the processing end server where the above discussed proposed
    sensor data analysis module is implemented. The collected information is processed
    and decisions are made as per the logical conditions. So that the drip irrigation
    module will start to pump the water in different levels depends on the logical
    conditions obtained. The simple setup has been experimented as a prototype where
    the soil temperature and humidity are varied while collecting the data Fig. 9
    Hardware setup used in the proposed IoT based smart agriculture Full size image
    4 Result and Discussion The proposed smart agriculture model is experimented in
    MATLAB 14.1 to analyze the sensor data. Based on the sensor data results, fuzzy
    based irrigation system starts the irrigation process. the results are numerically
    evaluated due to practical limitations. However, the performance will be similar
    to real time environment. To ensure the operation of irrigation system moisture
    content, humidity and temperature are considered. The soil moisture content observed
    from the moisture sensor is listed in Table 3. Soil moisture describes the amount
    of water content present in the soil and it is measured in centibars. Table 3
    Soil moisture values from moisture sensor Full size table Table 4 Temperature
    values from temperature sensor Full size table Table 5 Humidity values from humidity
    sensor Full size table Tables 4 and 5 depicts the values of temperature sensor
    and humidity sensor observed value and its variables obtained from fuzzy controller.
    The range for each category is presented in detail so that decision can be made
    using fuzzy rules. For drip irrigation system the variables and its range are
    depicted in Table 6. Table 6 Drip Irrigation control Full size table In order
    to validate the performance of proposed smart irrigation system, the soil moisture
    is decreased slowly and the results are observed. The proposed sensor data analysis
    system needs real-time sensor data which is received from the fields. The collected
    data was used to train the learning model. The sensor values are used to train
    the learning model as four classes such as Short, Medium, Long, and Not required.
    The codes assigned for different classes are listed in Table 7. Table 7 Codes
    for class labels Full size table The average readings from sensors, fuzzy logic
    and irrigation states are observed for two hours and depicted in Fig. 9. The first
    graph describes the soil moisture values obtained from the data analysis model
    and it is observed from the figure the moisture level changes from 2100 sample
    and it continues ill 2700. Similarly, the humidity values for all the samples
    are presented as the second graph in Fig. 10. There is no change in humidity values
    and it gradually varies due to environmental factors. Similarly, temperature values
    are also gradually varying due to daylight intensity. While measuring the temperature,
    the daylight intensity is also measured to observe the light intensity details.
    For the entire samples observed in the two hours, the temperature and humidity
    gradually vary and due to this, the moisture level of the soil varies. For experimental
    purposes, the values are further decreased in the specified range. It is observed
    that when there is a reduction in soil moisture, the fuzzy output increases which
    make the irrigation system operate for a long time, and if the values cross the
    medium-range then the irrigation system reduces the operation and cuts off if
    it reaches the minimum value. Depends on the fuzzy variables the irrigation module
    selects its range from short to long duration to maintain the moisture level.

    image The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through tests performed
    on sample data obtained from the sensors. The data obtained from different instances
    are used to train and test the proposed data analysis module in the ratio of 80:20.
    The parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score are measured
    based on the values obtained from the confusion matrix. The obtained values are
    listed in Table 8 for different classes. Table 8 Performance metrics Full size
    table The performance metrics of proposed model parameters such as precision,
    recall, and F1-score are comparatively depicted in Fig. 11. It is observed that
    maximum precision and recall values are obtained for class code 2 which correctly
    determines the water requirement. From the analysis, the average accuracy of the
    proposed system is evaluated as 94.5%. Fig. 11 Performance metrics analysis Full
    size image The accurate sensor data analysis improves the overall performance
    and thus proposed approach reduces the water utilization at the same time right
    amount of water needs for the farms are satisfied through the control application.
    Further to validate the performance of proposed model accuracy with existing approaches
    a comparative analysis is depicted in Fig. 12. The results are adopted from the
    research works of Safdar Munir.et.al [37] and Pradeep et al. [38]. Fig. 12 Performance
    comparative analysis Full size image The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) based smart
    irrigation system attains a maximum accuracy of 65%, whereas similar smart irrigation
    system which includes multiple classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM),
    Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) to measure the system accuracy. The
    attained accuracy of the above classifiers is 94.50%, 98.8%, and 98.9%, respectively,
    which is lesser than the proposed model accuracy of 99.64%. From this comparative
    analysis, it is evident that the proposed model exhibits superior performance
    than existing apprpoches in smart irrigation and farming based on IoT devices.
    5 Conclusion Smart agriculture is an important thing for the present situation
    due to environmental changes and inadequate labor. In order to increase the farming
    activities and avoid losses in agriculture, smart agriculture concepts are introduced
    in this research work using the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed design
    is developed with an IoT-based smart monitoring system along with a smart irrigation
    system to increase the yearly yields. Deep learning-based IoT module efficiently
    collects and analyzes the data and by using fuzzy controller smart irrigation
    system is developed in the proposed model. Data collected from various sensor
    modules are efficiently utilized to predict the water requirements. compared to
    conventional farming techniques the implementation cost is a bit high but it is
    a one-time investment so that the excess cost for manual intervention can be eliminated
    using the proposed approach. Future research directions in continuation of the
    proposed work could introduce optimization methodologies to improve the efficiency
    of smart irrigation systems by reducing computing costs. Data availability Data

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates SECTION I. Introduction
    In what is labelled as the “Global Water Crisis”, UN and the World Bank released
    predictions of scarcity of clean water resources and as a corollary, the calamitous
    effect on agriculture as the demand increases, what now with extended periods
    of hot weather and droughts [1]. Inevitably, the effect will ripple over across
    the quality of life people lead in areas with direct contact to the cultivated
    lands as well as areas who depend marginally on them to supply their food production.
    The world''s demand for water is likely to surge in the next few decades where
    rapidly growing population will drive increased consumption by people, farms,
    and companies. Water availability of regions naturally liable to dryness like
    the Arabian Peninsula are expected to drop by half in the next 25 years [2], [3].
    Rather unsurprisingly, efforts to restrict excessive watering and water demand
    control have been made and include raising the price to pose such restrictions.
    However, while this helps conserve water when resources are depleting, it does
    pose a challenge to farmers on how to micromanage their business to adapt to this
    change. To add to that, climate change is expected to make some areas drier and
    others wetter, making the need for proper efficient irrigation management systems
    all the more necessary[4]. Fig. 1 Water stress by country 2040 [2] Show All Agriculture
    remains the worlds biggest water consumer, with farming and food production accounting
    up to 70% of it [2], [5]. With so much water going into the sector, one would
    expect an over-abundance of water resources dedicated to agriculture. However,
    one of the largest contributors to water wastage is low irrigation efficiency.
    Currently, and according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an
    astonishing 60 % of the water diverted or pumped for irrigation is wasted via
    runoff into waterways or evapotranspiration [3]–[5]. This has derived a high demand
    for intelligent irrigation systems that are capable of providing efficiency that
    is unobtainable without adequate data analysis and suitable implementation strategies.
    Such smart systems are based on the Internet of Things technology (IoT) which
    will largely depend on data-driven automated signals. These signals are generated
    and received by components; sensors and actuators, controlled by wired and wireless
    connections such as IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11 [6]–[8]. The paper is organized
    as follows: section II reviews a survey of the recent existing research activities
    on IoT based smart irrigations and fuzzy decision support systems. The system
    model will be presented in section III. The experimental results and analysis
    are detailed in section IV followed by the conclusion. SECTION II. Related Works
    IoT is a general concept for the ability of network devices to feel and collect
    data from the world around us, and then share that data across the Internet where
    it can be processed and applied for several interesting purposes. Whereas other
    technologies center on evolving previous services or providing ease of use and
    ergonomic products, IoT prioritizes optimization above all, with optimization
    techniques being critical to the success of any of its systems [8], [9]. Several
    studies have been conducted on utilizing IoT technology as well as fuzzy inference
    systems in the field of agriculture. The use of such systems aims at achieving
    higher yield and overall improved quality of products. In [10] a proposed system
    developed to measure weather condition values and use these values to calculate
    the required water quantity for irrigation. Another system architecture is proposed
    in [7] that evaluates a cloud-based wireless communication system that can be
    also used to monitor and control a set of sensors and actuators to assess the
    plants water need. Providing decision support system will facilitate irrigation
    in a controlled manner, where areas with less water content are highlighted and
    alternatively areas with large water content will less likely to be adversely
    irrigated, maintaining soil moisture at even levels all across the land targeted.
    Many studies have discussed irrigation systems using conventional feedback control
    systems such as open-loop and closed-loop control systems [12]–[14]. However,
    and in order to tackle the real uncertainty and the complexity of the environmental
    conditions, fuzzy theory is used to improve the ability to make correct decisions
    [15]. Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic provide a powerful method to represent
    and process human knowledge in the form of fuzzy “IF- THEN” rules, that can be
    then translated into a form of a controller. Thus, fuzzy logic controllers like
    Mamdani Controller are simpler than other traditional controllers since they are
    closer to human thinking and natural language[16]. Fig. 2 The design of the irrigation
    system Show All SECTION III. System Model The system architecture of the smart
    irrigation system is shown in Fig. 2. Composed of five components, the smart irrigation
    system is implemented by a series of actions taken by each of the individual components,
    first of which is a network of sensors to record environments variables, a control
    unit and a communication media. The use of IOT technology will facilitate the
    communication between the soil and the water flow controller. A. Sensors and Communication
    Media Five sensors were used to log the environment variables, namely, light intensity,
    LM 393 soil moisture, DHT11 temperature and air humidity. Other sensors such as
    flow meter sensors are used to ensure optimize irrigation frequency to a minimum
    value by moderating the rate of water flow during the day or night time. Data
    acquired by sensors is processed by the microcontroller and IEEE 802.15.4 is used
    as the communication media between the systems components. Fig. 3 Triangular and
    trapezoidal fuzzy membership functions Show All B. Fuzzy Controller for Water
    Pump Mamdani''s fuzzy inference technique is the most generally utilized fuzzy
    approach used in fuzzy controllers. Mamdani''s strategy was one the most important
    control frameworks constructed utilizing fuzzy set theory. It was found in 1975
    by Ebrahim Mamdani as an attempt to control a steam engine and heater blend by
    integrating an arrangement of linguistics control rules acquired from experienced
    human administrators. Mamdani''s technique depended on Lotfi Zadeh''s 1973 paper
    on fuzzy calculations for complex frameworks and choice procedures. Mamdani-type
    deduction utilizes piecewise linear membership functions; triangular fuzzy numbers
    (TFN) and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFN) as appeared in Fig. 3. The common way
    to specify a TFN in analytical form is displayed in equation 1 below: μ TFN (x;
    a 1 ,  a 2 , a 3 )= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, x− a 1 a 2 − a 1 , a 3 −x a 3 − a

    express the general form for a TrFN is displayed in equation 2 below: μ ΓrFN (x;
    a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 )= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0, x> a 1 x− a 1 a 2 −

    (2) (2) View Source In this paper, a Mamdani fuzzy controller is used to control
    water flow from the water pump. There are two inputs for this controller, soil
    moisture and outside temperature, and one output which is the water flow from
    the water pump. The fuzzy controller is designed and implemented using MATLAB.
    The Controller is shown in the Fig. 4. In order to control the water flow from
    the pump a rotary switch is used. The switch range is from zero to five; where
    zero means no water flow and five is the maximum flow. The idea is to control
    the position of this switch automatically based on the inputs. In order to build
    the fuzzy control system that will control the water flow to a desired level,
    we would need to define two inputs; the first one is the soil moisture (SM) and
    the second one is the outside temperature (TE). These two inputs will be used
    to control the water flow by automatically changing the switch position in the
    water pump. Fig. 4 Fuzzy logic controller for the water pump Show All Fig. 5 Fuzzy
    relation for the first input (Rsm) Show All Fig. 6 Fuzzy relation for the second
    input (Rte) Show All Fig. 7 Fuzzy relation for the output (RSctl) Show All For
    instance, if the soil moisture is low, and the temperature is high, then the switch
    position need to be set to maximum flow. However, if the moisture is medium and
    the temperature is high, we want to set the switch half way between zero and five.
    The two inputs are continuously monitored using the sensors, and the output status
    is adjusted accordingly. Now, we need to build our control system based on the
    Mamdani fuzzy logic inference system. In this case the switch position will be
    defined by linguistic levels rather than numerical values, so a zero or off position
    will be very low and half way position will be medium. The inputs for the robot
    speed control in fuzzy terms are defined as: t SM = t TE ={L, M, H} where: SM:
    soil moisture TE: outside temperature t SM fuzzy terms for SM t TE : fuzzy terms
    for TE L: low, M: medium, H: high The output in fuzzy terms will be: tsw= {VL,
    L, M, H, VH} where: VL: very low L: low M: medium H: high The switch output, Y
    Sct1 =[0,5] which includes all the real numbers between zero and five. Fuzzy relations
    (R) has been used for the inputs based on TrFN membership functions for the low
    and the High and TFN for the medium: For R SM → For R SC →  L:(0,0,30,50)    L:(0,0,15,25)  M:(30,50,70)     M:(15,25,35)  H:(50,70,100,100)

    Fuzzy rules for the water flow controller These fuzzy relations for the inputs
    and the output for the fuzzy controller are shown in figures (5–7). The fuzzy
    rules for the flow controller are designed to be as shown in table I, using these
    fuzzy rules the output of the Controller YSetl will be changed to fuzzy linguistic
    terms. The logic we used in this table is based on the knowledge of what we want
    the water flow to be based on the moisture and the temperature (inputs). The range
    for the first input is [0-100] and for the second input is [0-50]. The values
    for these inputs are continuously measured using sensors, and the output position
    (switch) is changed based on this logic. There is a total of nine rules; table
    I can also be expressed as a set of rules as shown in table II. The proposed water
    flow controller is based on Mamdani Fuzzy inference system which consists of four
    steps: Fuzzification of the inputs: the input is transformed from numerical value
    into linguistic term. To do that, we can use the membership function for the triangular
    fuzzy numbers with substituting the right values for a1, a2, a1, After this step,
    the input will look something like SM ′ =0.6/L+0.3/M⋯etc . Fuzzification of the
    output: the output is calculated from the inputs in terms of fuzzy linguistics
    term. In this step, the output in fuzzy linguistic terms will be something like:
    Sctl ′ =0.4/L+0.2/M Transfer the fuzzy subset of the set of linguistic terms for
    the output to a fuzzy subset of the set of numerical values. In order to do that,
    we need to use fuzzy composition using the Max-Min Rule. Expressing the max-min
    Rule as it relates to our specific speed control design, we could write the following:
    μ y ′′ =Max{Min  [ μ y ′ (t), μ y ′  It, y)]}; for all y∈ Y  S ctl (3) View Source

    Fig. 9 The switch output for water flow controller when SM=90,TE=25) Show All
    Table II: Linguistics rules In our design for the output YSctl takes all the real
    numbers [0, 5]. Defuzzification: Transforming the fuzzy set of the output in one
    numerical value, which can be estimated using the central of gravity method: Sctl=
    ∑ y=a b Y× μ Y ′′ μ Y ,dY ; Sctl:is the control switch position (4) View Source
    In this step, we multiply the membership value that we got from the last step
    by each output value and find the summation. Afterwards, we divide this sum by
    the sum of all the output value by assuming that the estimated output is integer
    between a and b. If the output is the set of all the real numbers between a and
    b, we have to do integration instead of the summation in the formula mentioned
    above. MATLAB is employed for this calculation, since the numbers we use in our
    speed ccontrol design are all real numbers between 0 and 5. SECTION IV. Experimental
    Results and Analysis In this paper, the Fuzzy controller for controlling the speed
    of a robot was built using Mamdani inference system as discussed earlier. The
    two inputs SM and TE were used to control the switch position (VL, L, M, H). MATLAB
    was used to build the fuzzy Controller. The output of the speed controller will
    be the switch position and it is given as a numerical value from zero to five,
    with zero being the lowest and five means that the switch is set to the maximum
    position (highest water flow). Two outputs of the MATLAB program for the flow
    Controller are shown in figure (8–9). Fig. 10 Relationship between the inputs
    and the output for the fuzzy controller Show All From Fig. 8, when the soil moisture
    is low (11%) and the temperature is High (40°C) then the output of the controller
    was (4.27) which means the water flow will be high. Also, in Fig. 9 when the soil
    moisture is high, then the output of the water flow very low (0.765) which means
    that the switch is set close to the minimum, and this again agrees with our fuzzy
    rule table, since the output is expected to be very low in this case. The relationship
    between the two inputs (soil moisture and temperature) is shown also in the MATLAB
    surface plot in Fig. 10. It can be seen from this surface plot the when the moisture
    is low then the water flow in the pump is high (yellow color), and when the moisture
    is high then the water flow is very low (blue color). SECTION V. Conclusion Fuzzy
    logic and IoT technology were presented as a strategy to develop an intelligent
    irrigation approach that fosters water conservation and better irrigation management
    in areas with high levels of water stress. The developed fuzzy controller, based
    on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions,
    efficiently set the time and duration of irrigation for a given crop. The use
    of fuzzy control helped maintaining the soil moisture above a pre-set value with
    smooth variations preventing frequent system''s run-off and preserving water and
    energy. In order to monitor system in real time, a wide-range ZigBee based wireless
    network was also used. The system is easy to implement. And economically justifiable.

    communication 1. Introduction The United Nations (UN) is promoting sustainable
    development goals (SDGs) that aim to create impactful agriculture industry. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT)-based smart farming technologies
    are transforming the agriculture industry from seedling cultivation to food processing.
    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of UN projects that by 2050, the world’s
    population will further increase by 2 billion, putting more stress on agricultural
    land and food production (Colizzi et al., 2020). AI-based IoT and machine learning
    technologies are being developed to improve agricultural productivity and reduce
    waste (Navarro et al., 2020, Kakamoukas et al., 2021, Mahbub, 2020). Moreover,
    smart farming technologies use digital tools to improve agriculture efficiency,
    productivity, and sustainability. The growth of smart farming drives the development
    of the digital economy through new market opportunities, increased transparency,
    and addressing challenges, such as, climate change. Smart farming combines AI
    and IoT with the conventional farming techniques to improve agriculture efficiency
    and productivity through data-driven decisions. It is the key component of Agriculture
    4.0, the fourth agriculture revolution, promoting smart cultivation and crop management
    (Javaid et al., 2022, Monteleone et al., 2020;20:7091., Singh and Yogi, 2022,
    Torky and Hassanein, 2020, Navarro et al., 2020). Additionally, the second UN
    Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-2) of eradicating hunger can be accomplished
    with the help of the integration of AI and IoT technology in the agriculture sector.
    In addition to increasing agricultural output and efficiency, AI-based IoT farming
    can give farmers useful insights and decision-making tools that are based on current
    data. AI systems, for example, may assess information from sensors and other field
    equipment to maximise fertilisation and irrigation, reducing waste and ultimately
    improving crop quality. Furthermore, IoT-enabled monitoring tools can help with
    the early detection of diseases and pests, allowing farmers to respond right away
    and minimise damage to their crops. Another way that AI and IoT may help SDG-2
    is by promoting sustainable agriculture to minimise hunger. For instance, AI systems
    may instruct farmers to use electricity, water, and fertilizer efficiently, reducing
    their environmental effect and protecting natural resources. IoT sensors can also
    be used to gather data on how climate change is affecting crops and monitor the
    condition of the soil, allowing farmers to adapt their practices and increase
    crop resilience. Moreover, through enhancing supply chain management and distribution
    networks, AI and IoT can also be crucial in minimising food waste and enhancing
    food security. For instance, AI algorithms can assist in balancing supply and
    demand, lowering food waste throughout the supply chain and enhancing access to
    wholesome food (Maraveas et al., 2022). Researchers and agriculturists are working
    towards achieving the goal of a sustainable farming by developing smart systems.
    These systems utilize advanced technologies, like, AI and IoT to gather and analyze
    data, enabling informed decisions about farming practices. The aim is to improve
    agricultural productivity and optimize crop management while promoting smart farming
    through sustainable practices (Kumar and Sharma, 2020, Lohchab et al., 2018, Igri
    et al., 2022), intelliegent techniques (Hsu et al., 2020, Miloudi et al., 2019,
    Chen and Yeh, 2020) and predictive tools for the smart farming based on AI and
    IoT to ensure precision agriculture (Ehiakpor et al., 2021, Akinyi, 2022, Martin
    et al., 2020, Mahbub, 2020, Javaid et al., 2022). AI and IoT-based smart farming
    can greatly contribute to the stability and diversity of ecological functions
    that support food production and other agricultural ecosystems. The use of these
    technologies can lead to improved decision-making and optimized farming procedures
    and practices that result in a more sustainable and efficient use of resources.
    This leads to a much healthier and more resilient agricultural ecosystem, which
    is essential for long-term food production and the preservation of the natural
    environment (Sharma et al., 2022). Though, may be, the IoT and AI-based smart
    farming could also be considered a risky investment because it might lead the
    business towards a tight profit margin or sometimes may cause uncertain yields.
    However, agriculture plays a significant role in the global economy, contributing
    approximately 3 % to the gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide. However, in Least
    Developed Countries (LDCs), the agricultural sector can have a much larger impact,
    accounting for up to 60 % of their national GDP, as reported by the FAO and World
    Bank data (Beckman and Countryman, 2021, Havemann et al., 2020). The world''s
    population is growing and so is the demand for food. By 2050, food production
    must increase by 70 % to meet this demand, which require improving existing agricultural
    practices and the introduction of technology to increase productivity and food
    security (Khan et al., 2021, Monteleone et al., 2020;20:7091.). The Food and FAO
    defines Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) as a set of guidelines for producing
    safe and healthy food, and non-food agricultural products in a more sustainable
    manner. GAP encompasses all aspects of agricultural production, from on-farm procedures
    to post-production processes, and considers the ecosocial, and environmental impact
    of agriculture on earth. The goal of GAP is to ensure that agricultural products
    are of high quality and meet food safety standards while being produced in a way
    that is economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable (Leong et al.,
    2020, Pham et al., 2021, Singh and Yogi, 2022). IoT techniques are transforming
    in agriculture on a large scale with a focus on three main areas of development;
    namely, wireless network engineering and applications, device design, and security
    challenges. AI is increasingly being used in agriculture and many other institutions
    and nations have adopted AI and IoT strategies and policies for better analysis,
    predictions and performance. Despite the significant amount of research on AI-based
    IoT smart farming, there is still a need for further reseach in this area (Lee
    et al., 2021, Yazdinejad et al., 2021, Bwambale et al., 2022). According to research
    reported in (AlMetwally et al., 2020), smart farming uses technology to monitor
    and manage crop production. IoT links remote devices, like robots and sensors
    to track changes in soil characteristics, soil moisture, climate, and other factors.
    This allows for automatic data-driven decision making. Due to the IoT basded techniques,
    smart farming is now possible in urban areas, such as, on building roofs and in
    indoor environment. Effective data management is crucial for the successful smart
    farming in both urban and rural areas. Irrigation is an important part of agriculture,
    especially in areas where the yearly rainfall is below 500 mm. Irrigation has
    been used for thousands of years in these regions such as, in most parts of the
    Africa, Asia, and the America to support crops. In (Podder et al., 2021;82:104025.,
    Doshi and Patel, 2019, Singh et al., 2022, Singh and Sivaram, 2022, Maraveas et
    al., 2022, Kumar and Sharma, 2020, Lohchab et al., 2018, Igri et al., 2022) multiple
    systems are proposed for managing smart agriculture farming that monitor essential
    parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture for improved efficiency
    and productivity. By collecting and analyzing data on these parameters, farmers
    can make more informed decisions about their farming practices and procedures.
    The proposals are based on the potential for technology to revolutionize traditional
    farming practices, optimize resource use, and lead to higher crop yields and better
    environmental outcomes. The authors'' focus on essential parameters and their
    potential to provide a comprehensive understanding of the farming environment
    make their study an important contribution to the literature on smart agriculture,
    though further research is needed to validate their effectiveness. The aim of
    this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements
    in smart agricultural management and highlight the benefits and potential of AI
    and IoT technologies in the achievement of sustainability. Proper agriculture
    management and sustainability can be effectively attained through the implementation
    of smart farming techniques and approaches, alongside continuous advancements
    in this field. The review focuses on the use of IoT-based agriculture management
    techniques for sustainable farming with the utilization of robots and UAVs for
    real-time monitoring, control, and automation. The importance of LoRaWAN technology
    for wireless communications in smart agricultural management is also discussed.
    Additionally, various aspects of farming, such as, crop field data analysis and
    application utilization is also explored. The objective is to provide insights
    into the latest technologies and innovations that can help food producers to increase
    their yield and efficiency. By utilizing smart farming technologies, stakeholders
    in the agriculture sector can make informed decisions about technology investments,
    leading to improve food production while considering environmental sustainability.
    The integration of AI and IoT in agriculture shows great potential for enhancing
    production monitoring and sensing capabilities. This includes optimizing crop
    selection, determining the most suitable growing seasons, efficient resource utilization,
    monitoring animal behavior, tracking crop growth, and managing food processing.
    Moreover, AI-based machine learning algorithms offer improved data analysis capabilities
    and enable the prediction of favorable agricultural practices (Sanaeifar et al.,
    2023). Fig. 1 represent a concise overview of the research, illustrating the transition
    from traditional agriculture to smart farming techniques and ultimately, the attainment
    of sustainability in farming. Download : Download high-res image (339KB) Download

    techniques and approaches Smart farming is a modern and efficient approach to
    farming that leverages technology to optimize crop production and improve yields.
    By utilizing advanced techniques such as, data analysis and targeted inputs, farmers
    are able to increase efficiency and reduce waste. The result is a more sustainable
    and profitable agricultural industry that can better meet the demands of a growing
    global population (Martos et al., 2021, Podder et al., 2021;82:104025.). An Internet
    of Things (IoT) based precision agriculture smart farm looks at using technology
    to gather data to better manage what is happening on the farm, and of course,
    those things that can get spread across other curriculum areas, in terms of Maths,
    Biology, and Science. Therefore, it entails learning more about the activities
    taking place on the agricultural farm. Thus, observing the flora, fauna, and microclimates
    throughout the entire educational institution. Thus, it deployed a variety of
    sensors to collect data and information and compile it in one location so farmers
    could review the data and see what was happening on the farm, minute by minute
    (Tagarakis et al., 2021, Doshi and Patel, 2019). Smart agriculture farming is
    the future of farming, utilizing advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and
    maximize yields, while minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture. It
    plays a vital role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
    (UN SDGs) of ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and
    promoting sustainable agriculture. Smart farming techniques, such as variable
    rate fertilization, precision planting, and precision irrigation, enable farmers
    to precisely target inputs to particular fields, reducing waste and conserving
    resources, leading to higher yields and improved soil health. The data collected
    through smart agriculture provides valuable insights, enabling farmers to make
    informed decisions, resulting in improved nutritional outcomes. Adopting smart
    agriculture practices helps ensure a sustainable future for farming operations
    and provides food security and improved nutrition for people globally. AI and
    IoT based smart farming use advanced technology to improve agriculture practices.
    In order to track changes in the environmental factors both within and outside
    the farm, as well as the nutrition supply to the crops, sensors and monitoring
    equipment have been installed. AI algorithms then analyse the data to generate
    decisions and manage different farm systems. For instance, the system can automatically
    open or close windows to control temperature and provide the crops with the essential
    nutrition. (Andrianto et al., 2021). As seen in Fig. 2, it can also be carried
    out autonomously or remotely. Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download

    farming increases productivity by allowing farmers to react rapidly and effectively
    to changes in the weather. Smart farms can produce up to 30 % more and produce
    food of a higher calibre than conventional farms. Through the use of sensors and
    data analysis, farmers are able to adjust to sudden changes like rain, wind, or
    temperature swings by receiving timely messages on their phones. Smart farming
    methods lead to more productive and efficient agricultural practises. (Zamora-Izquierdo
    et al., 2019, Moysiadis et al., 2021, Shahab et al., 2020, Hsu et al., 2020, Miloudi
    et al., 2019). 1.2. Vertical Farming: Benefits and challenges Vertical farming
    involves stacking layers of crops in a controlled environment in order to maximise
    the use of the finite amount of land and water resources. Fig. 3 illustrates how
    vertical farms'' controlled environments allow for the optimization of growth
    conditions, resulting in higher yields and higher-quality produce. Additionally,
    vertical farming helps to reduce the demand for transportation while increasing
    access to locally grown food. A more sustainable way to produce food is through
    the use of hydroponic and aeroponic systems used in vertical farming. Numerous
    benefits exist for this innovative approach to farming in terms of productivity,
    output, and sustainability (SharathKumar et al., 2020). The vertical farming system
    is a much more productive and resource-conserving method of agriculture than traditional
    open-field farming. Research indicates that compared to conventional agricultural
    practises, vertical farming consumes about 95 % less water and other resources.
    This decrease in water and other resources leads to significantly more environmentally
    friendly farming. The controlled environment means that less pesticides and other
    chemicals are required to safeguard the crops in vertical farming than in typical
    agricultural systems. This indicates that crops produced in vertical farms are
    not only more productive but also safer to eat (Ayambire et al., 2019, Avgoustaki
    and Xydis, 2020, Pham et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (228KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Vertical farming (Santini et al.,
    2021). Urban vertical farming, as an innovative approach, significantly contributes
    to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by optimizing resource utilization
    and expediting the transition to a circular economy through its multifaceted advantages
    (Pakseresht et al., 2023, Oh and Lu, 2023). Additionally, by making fresh, wholesome
    food accessible in metropolitan areas and lowering the need for transportation,
    it can support societal objectives. By using fewer resources and producing less
    waste than conventional farming techniques, vertical farming also contributes
    to reducing the effects of climate change (Carotti et al., 2023). Additionally,
    it offers a chance for recycling urban organic waste, lessening its environmental
    impact even more. The SDGs can be achieved and a more sustainable future can be
    created using a crucial strategy called vertical farming. 1.3. IoT integration
    in agriculture The Internet of Things (IoT) comprises internet-connected, computer-based
    devices that facilitate autonomous communication (El-Ghamry et al., 2023), leading
    to enhanced automation and seamless data interchange among diverse devices over
    a network (Nakip et al., 2019). This transformative technology is poised to revolutionize
    multiple sectors, with the number of IoT devices projected to grow from approximately
    39 billion in 2025 to 50 billion in 2030 (Karie et al., 2020, Behm et al., 2019).
    Applications of IoT span various domains, including industry, transport, telehealth,
    agriculture, and domestic settings, as illustrated in Fig. 4 and detailed in Table
    1, which categorizes IoT applications into home services, community services,
    transport industry, and large-scale applications, each with specialized sub-categories

    in agriculture. 1.3.1. IoT sensors for environmental monitoring A sensor captures
    physical phenomena like temperature or pressure, converting the data into an electrical
    signal that, to be meaningful, necessitates integration into an electronic system
    capable of interpretation and utilization (Yin et al., 2021). Within the domain
    of smart farming, sensors function as specialized instruments designed to provide
    accurate and real-time information pertaining to crops and agricultural environments,
    measuring parameters such as light intensity, temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture. Subsequently, these sensors transmit the collected data wirelessly to
    a central system for in-depth analysis. The primary objective of smart sensors
    in smart farming is to empower farmers with actionable knowledge and insights,
    facilitating informed decision-making to maximize operational efficiency and yield
    optimization. The integration of these sensors holds the potential to significantly
    improve crop planning and management, thereby contributing to the development
    of a more profitable and sustainable farming sector (García et al., 2020). The

    Application areas of smart sensors. IoT technologies facilitate the establishment
    of an interlinked network comprising intelligent devices, sensors, and machinery
    that acquire, transmit, and process real-time data. This information is subsequently
    utilized to make informed decisions concerning crop management, enhancing overall
    efficiency in agricultural practices (Singh et al., 2022). IoT-based devices are
    capable of retrieving soil-related metrics such as temperature, moisture, and
    pH values, transferring the data from the fields to an online cloud platform.
    The cloud platform processes this information to derive actionable insights, which
    are then relayed back to the devices. These devices, in turn, execute automated
    activities such as irrigation, harvesting, and pest control (Phasinam et al.,
    2022, Bhatnagar and Chandra, 2020, Pathak et al., 2019). This information can
    then be used to optimize various aspects of agriculture, such as irrigation, fertilization,
    and crop management. With IoT, farmers can make data-driven decisions to increase
    yields and reduce waste, leading to a more sustainable and profitable agriculture
    industry (Farooq et al., 2019). IoT is also used for smart irrigation quality
    of water, seepage, usage and treatment, water distribution units, and managing
    agricultural wastes (Debauche et al., 2021, Singh and Sivaram, 2022). The application
    of IoT in agriculture for several kinds of environmental monitoring is mentioned
    in Table 2. Table 2. IoT applications in environmental monitoring. Environment

    Adenugba et al., 2019) (Jiang, 2019) (Jain and Awasthi, 2019) (Jawad et al., 2018)
    The IoT and other cutting-edge technologies are used in smart agriculture to enhance
    crop management and raise yields. Several researches reported the application
    of IoT in agriculture listed in Table 2 emphasise the importance of implementing
    smart farming tools for crop monitoring (Mgomezulu et al., 2023). These solutions
    are adaptable and may be used in a variety of settings, including greenhouses,
    orchards, agricultural fields, and more. They provide vital environmental information
    including temperature, humidity, and brightness. One of the most important steps
    towards feeding the expanding population and maintaining food security is investing
    in IoT technologies for smart farming (Tyczewska et al., 2023). IoT-enabled smart
    farming offers a preventative method of disease management. Farmers now have access
    to a lot of data that can help them identify and stop diseases before they become
    a problem. This data includes temperature, humidity, and even photographs of the
    crops. Utilising various technology and practices that support sustainable agriculture
    is crucial to achieving sustainable agricultural goals. Integrating IoT and AI
    technologies is one such strategy that can improve farming practises by supplying
    insightful information and data. For instance, smart farming''s proactive disease
    control strategy can shield crops from damage, boosting output and resource effectiveness
    (Periakaruppan et al., 2023). Similarly, managing power consumption of IoT devices
    can promote energy efficiency and extend battery life, reducing the environmental
    impact (Iqbal et al., 2023). Precise water management using weather and data patterns
    can optimize resource utilization and enhance crop growth, leading to sustainable
    and successful farming practices. (Lee et al., 2021). 1.3.2. IoT based smart irrigation
    Systems: Enhancing water efficiency The improvement of water management practices
    can greatly progress the lives of people globally by promoting a sustainable water
    supply and agriculture (Kumar et al., 2022). This can result in a more sustainable
    future, with positive effects on the environment, economy, and society. In short,
    addressing the issue of water management can lead to a better future for all (El-Beltagi
    et al., 2022). Effective water resource management is essential for sustainable
    agriculture and profitable farming. It involves a comprehensive approach to water
    resource utilization from planning to monitoring. Adopting water resource management
    systems can revolutionize agriculture and secure a sustainable future for communities
    and businesses (Xiang et al., 2021). Smart irrigation relies on sensors that provide
    valuable data and analytics on irrigation system to help farmers and agronomists
    make informed decisions and optimize their agri-business operations. The sensors-based
    smart irrigation system consists of various components interconnected by services
    and interfaces, including data players and sensors, as illustrated in Fig. 8.
    Farmers and agronomists can access an integrative analysis of meteorological and
    sensor data through user-friendly web applications that provide recommendations
    for optimal fieldwork (Stein, 2021, Mohapatra, 2022, Almalki et al., 2021, Miloudi
    et al., 2019, Pham et al., 2021, Lee et al., 2021, Yazdinejad et al., 2021, Bwambale
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (385KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Smart irrigation system (Obaideen et al., 2022). The use
    of IoT-based smart irrigation systems has the potential to completely change how
    we approach farming. These systems can accurately monitor soil moisture levels,
    weather conditions and water usage, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount
    of water. This leads to increased yield and efficiency, reducing waste and preserving
    precious water resources. The smart irrigation system not only benefits the farmers
    and the environment but also the consumers by providing fresher, better quality
    produce. So, it''s time to embrace the technology and make the switch to smart
    irrigation. For better understanding a brief comparison between the traditional
    and smart irrigation is performed in Table 3. The traditional approach involves
    manual operation with methods like, flooding and watering cans. While smart irrigation
    utilizes automated systems and IoT technology for real-time monitoring and control,
    using techniques like moisture sensors and wireless communication. Table 3. Irrigation

    uses IoT technology to monitor and control water distribution Moisture Sensors,
    Weather Station, IoT Platforms, Actuators, Wireless Communications (Ramli and
    Jabbar, 2022) 1.3.3. Real-time soil monitoring for precision fertilization A cutting-edge
    approach in agriculture combines precision fertilization with real-time soil monitoring.
    This method involves continuously measuring basic parameters such as pH, supplement
    levels, and dampness by monitoring soil conditions (Swetha et al., 2022, Pal et
    al., 2022). Precision fertilization ensures the optimal application of fertilizers
    tailored to the specific needs of crops by using this real-time data. This approved
    method reduces excessive fertilizer use, improves crop yield and quality, and
    limits natural effects. A sustainable and effective agricultural practice is best
    exemplified by the combination of precision fertilization and real-time soil monitoring
    (Rotundo et al., 2022). 1.4. IoT-based livestock monitoring Smart Livestock Farming
    is the use of technology and data-driven approaches to optimize the production
    and management of livestock. There are several types of smart livestock farming,
    including precision livestock farming, automated feeding systems, wearable technology
    for livestock monitoring, and remote herd management (Sittón-Candanedo and Prieto,
    1239). 1.4.1. Cattle farming Cattle farming is an important economic sector in
    many countries, and it also provides necessary greenhouse gases that are essential
    for the environment (Alonso et al., 2020). However, most farmers still rely on
    traditional farming methods where cattle monitoring and management are done manually
    by farm workers. As the number of animals on a farm rises, this system is not
    scaleable and can be difficult. (Taneja et al., 2019). For large-scale farms with
    a bigger animal population, the traditional techniques of raising cattle require
    the use of manpower for animal management and monitoring, which can be costly.
    For farms with 100–500 animals, it is not cost-effective to employ two competent
    workers to manage 20 animals, for instance (Ile et al., 2023). Additionally, this
    results in inadequate management of animal health and feed, which lowers yield
    and degrades animal health. Modern farming methods have been created to solve
    this difficulty and produce an autonomous system for keeping track of the wellbeing
    and diet of animals utilising cutting-edge technology. Fig. 9 shows how effective
    such a system could be (Krueger et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image
    (401KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Animal monitoring system (Neethirajan
    and Kemp, 2021). The IoT can drastically reduce the amount of labour required
    in cow ranching to track and monitor each animal. It is essential for the health
    and performance of cattle to live in an environment that is suitable for them.
    Animal health is significantly influenced by the environment. (Neethirajan and
    Kemp, 2021, da Rosa et al., 2020, Hempel et al., 2019). Cattle health is significantly
    impacted by the two essential factors of humidity and temperature. Different cattle
    species can withstand different environmental conditions in different parts of
    the world (Płoneczka-Janeczko et al., 2023). To solve this problem, an Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based dairy farm might be built, allowing for remote control of
    the farm''s environmental conditions using a smartphone application and an internet
    connection. With the use of this technology, farmers can keep an eye on and manage
    the barn''s temperature, humidity, and ventilation levels, assuring the best possible
    living conditions for the animals. IoT-based sensors can also be deployed to keep
    track of each animal''s health, spot any aberrant behaviour, and promptly notify
    the farmer. This enables the early detection and treatment of any medical problems
    (Lovarelli et al., 2020). Beyond temperature and humidity, there are other significant
    factors that impact cattle. Additionally, rumination needs to be closely monitored
    because it directly affects the health of cattle. Cattle ruminate for nine to
    ten hours a day to aid in the proper digestion of their food. If they begin to
    feel sick, they stop ruminating. Therefore, monitoring rumination can be essential
    to monitoring cattle health. To locate tiny micro accelerations, one uses an acceleration
    sensor (Beauchemin, 2018). The data collected is then processed using machine
    learning algorithms to classify the activity and rumination time of the cattle
    (Shen et al., 2020). Technology adoption in farming is becoming a requirement
    rather than an option. Given the growing demand for sustainable farming, it is
    essential to use cutting-edge strategies to increase farming productivity while
    preserving the environment. One of the best examples of sustainable farming practises
    is the usage of AI and IoT cloud databases in cattle ranching. Cattle management
    decisions can be well-informed using the information gathered from the farm environment
    and cattle bodies, leading to lower costs, higher yields, and better animal health
    (Wang et al., 2023). Additionally, the usage of cloud databases encourages environmental
    friendliness by minimising the carbon footprint by lowering the quantity of physical
    hardware required in farming. Consequently, implementing AI and IoT in cow farming
    is a step towards sustainable farming, and it''s the way to go in the 21st century.
    1.4.2. Poultry farming Poultry refers to domesticated birds raised by humans for
    their eggs, meat, or feathers. As the global population continues to increase,
    the demand for poultry products is expected to rise (Dumont et al., 2020). Three
    key activities are included in smart poultry management systems: sensing and monitoring,
    assessment and decision-making, and intervention. The systems collect information
    about the chickens and their surroundings using sensors and monitoring equipment
    (Beam et al., 2023). To determine the health, happiness, and production of the
    chickens, this data is analysed and evaluated. Finally, the system steps in to
    ensure the best possible conditions for the chickens by making adjustments to
    the environment, giving medication, or giving them food (Astill et al., 2020).
    To maintain a sustainable food supply, the poultry farming business is embracing
    intelligent AI and IoT-based solutions (Castillo-Díaz et al., 2023). These technologies
    are being used by chicken breeders to increase productivity and efficiency due
    to the surge in worldwide poultry consumption (Astill et al., 2020, Xue et al.,
    2023). The affordability of animal protein provided by poultry farming is one
    of the primary factors contributing to its increasing popularity (Wahyono and
    Utami, 2018). According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
    the average person in the United States consumed 277.7 eggs in 2018. Globally,
    the production of eggs has been on the rise, with nearly 74 million metric tons
    of eggs produced in 2016, which is almost double the amount produced in 1990 (Conway,
    2018). The use of advanced technology has become increasingly prevalent in the
    poultry farming industry. Fig. 10 provides an overview of the technological advancements
    in poultry production systems, both current and future. The diagram depicts the
    various stages of technical advancements in poultry farming, starting from conventional
    cages and progressing to advanced and controlled smart systems based on AI and
    IoT. Each stage is accompanied by technological features that have been developed
    over time to enhance productivity and ensure welfare, production, reproduction,
    and product yields while minimizing the environmental impact and maintaining good
    health. The industry has transitioned from small-scale distributed procedures
    to extensive concentrated facilities in various forms with the help of precision-based
    livestock farming and smart poultry farming. These intelligent systems, primarily
    run by smart machines, consider food safety, labor costs, and animal welfare,
    resulting in sustainable and efficient poultry farming practices (Mallinger et
    al., 2023). Conventional cage systems (CC), enriched colony systems (EC), and
    aviary systems (AV) are some of the common housing systems utilized at different
    stages of poultry farming (Ren et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image

    2. Advances in smart farming technologies The agriculture sector has been altered
    by advances in smart farming technologies, which have provided creative answers
    for more sustainability and efficiency. These technologies, which range from AI-powered
    analytics to precision agriculture techniques, enable farmers to make data-driven
    decisions and increase crop yields (Karunathilake et al., 2023). The monitoring
    and administration of agricultural operations are further improved by the integration
    of IoT smart devices and sensors, resulting in more efficient and sustainable
    farming methods. 2.1. Hyper-personalized agriculture A state-of-the-art approach
    to farming is addressed by hyper-personalized agriculture, which makes use of
    cutting edge technologies for precise customization. This framework uses historical
    data and results from that specific area to carefully customise factors like nutrient
    dosing, irrigation schedules, and pest control to the unique requirements of each
    crop. The integration of data from various sources, such as sensors, weather reports,
    and soil analyses, allows for this level of customization. Enhancing and increasing
    crop yields while minimising asset use is the goal. This innovative approach has
    the potential to replace conventional farming methods with more effective, sustainable,
    and tailored farming methods in the future (Daraojimba et al., 2023, Gurumurthy
    et al., 2022). 2.2. Ecosystem-friendly farming Ecosystem-friendly farming is a
    sustainable farming approach designed to reduce reliance on fertilizers and pesticides,
    thereby improving soil health and minimising environmental impact. With this approach,
    ranchers adopt practices that promote biological equilibrium and biodiversity
    by integrating with regular ecosystems. Ecosystem-friendly farming reduces pollution
    in the environment and preserves the resilience of entire ecosystems by minimising
    the use of artificially created substances. This strategy encourages the use of
    regular pest control methods in conjunction with one another, such as presenting
    beneficial pests or employing sidekick establishing techniques, to reduce the
    need for harmful pesticides. (Xu et al., 2022). This farming method also improves
    soil health by reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers. In order to typically
    increase soil richness, it supports the use of natural matter, cover yields, and
    harvest pivot. A versatile and practical rural environment is cultivated by solid
    soils, which also contribute to improved water management, decreased disintegration,
    and increased supplement content. Generally speaking, ecosystem-friendly farming
    represents a holistic and sustainable vision for agriculture, one that prioritises
    long-term environmental stewardship and soil health while also taking into account
    the delicate balance of nature (Mahankale, 2023). 2.3. Software apps for smart
    farming Smart farming apps aim to make the life of farmers more efficient and
    productive. These apps turn the farmer''s mobile phone into a mobile crop manager
    by providing information and tools for crop management. The apps can diagnose
    and treat crops, offering practical solutions for common problems. Farmers from
    various locations and backgrounds can access the information offered by the apps
    because it is frequently translated into multiple languages. The apps provide
    farmers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and maximise crop
    productivity by giving a wide range of information on various crops. Smart farming
    apps can increase agriculture''s effectiveness, production, and profitability
    while also enhancing the quality of life for farmers (Francis et al., 2023). These
    apps can be downloaded from the app store on smart phone. Table 4 summarizes various
    software applications in smart farming, showcasing their purposes and key features
    for enhancing soil analysis, field data management, pest control, crop mapping,
    custom app creation, and real-time orchard monitoring. Table 4. Application softwares
    for smart farming. Software Application Purpose Key Features Reference Soil Analysis
    Allows farmers to monitor soil characteristics for better crop planning Monitors
    mineralogy, soil texture, and depth (Patil and Khairnar, 2022) Farm Manager Helps
    farmers manage and track field data for planting and spraying Views, monitors,
    and edits all field data, including crop, planting, and spraying conditions (Park
    and Park, 2021) Pest Management Offers smart pest solutions by gathering and sharing
    pest information Gathers pest existence information and employs a crowd-sourcing
    approach, sending images and position data to other agriculturalists (Karar et
    al., 2022) Agrippa Helps agronomists map fields and track crop growth Creates
    electronic maps of fields, tracks crops, and locates objects in the farm area
    (Saba et al., 2017) ThingSpeak Enables farmers to create custom apps for field
    and crop monitoring Allows for creation of customized apps and data transfer to
    MATLAB R2019a for analysis (Penchalaiah et al., 2020) Semios Provides real-time
    monitoring of orchard pests, frost, bugs, and irrigation Offers real-time event
    notifications and network coverage for orchard monitoring (Verma et al., 2022)
    2.4. Drones and robotics in agriculture A drone is an unmanned aircraft operated
    either autonomously by onboard computers or by a remote pilot. In precision agriculture,
    drones are increasingly used for various purposes, such as crop mapping, monitoring,
    and spraying (Kleinschroth et al., 2022). Drones provide farmers with a unique
    perspective of their fields, equipped with various sensors, such as thermal, multi-spectral,
    or RGB (Red Green Blue) cameras. The high-resolution thermal sensor on a drone
    can provide farmers with real-time data on their crops, even in the middle of
    the night. This allows farmers to count their cattle and monitor their crops,
    making informed decisions and optimizing their farming operations. As a result,
    drones have become an invaluable tool in precision agriculture, enabling farmers
    to gather crucial information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible
    to obtain (Agudo et al., 2018, Hafeez et al., 2022, Shahab et al., 2020). Agricultural
    drones equipped with cameras are changing the game in sustainable farming. They
    provide real-time information, optimize operations, reduce costs, and promote
    sustainability. Automation of tasks frees farmers'' time to increase yields while
    reducing environmental impact. Flying robots like the VoloDrone provide real-time
    updates on harvesting progress. Spraying drones are cost-effective and efficient
    for pesticide and fertilizer spraying (Li et al., 2023). These technologies are
    essential for sustainable farming, protecting the environment and promoting a
    healthier food system. (Pakseresht et al., 2023)Tractica analysts estimated the
    current market size of drones to be 141,4000 units, with a total value of $5.3
    billion, as illustrated in Fig. 11. It is expected that revenue and sales of drones
    will continue to increase significantly by 2025. Download : Download high-res
    image (67KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Drones market trend
    with time (Ryan Manuel, n.d.). Farmers have various mapping options at their disposal,
    including RGB maps that display regular color information and thermal maps that
    provide accurate temperature readings. Additionally, multi-spectral mapping is
    available to farmers, which offers insights into the health of their crops (Mattivi
    et al., 2021, SharathKumar et al., 2020). Drones can also be used for seed spreading,
    which is a fast and efficient method. In fact, it is considered one of the most
    effective ways to incorporate drones into farming operations (Hema and Sharma,
    2021, Ayambire et al., 2019). Drones represent the future of farming and one of
    their most useful features is spot spraying. With drone technology, farmers can
    efficiently spot spray their fields, without the need to blanket the entire field
    with chemicals, as in the case of traditional crop dusters (Ahmed et al., 2021,
    Avgoustaki and Xydis, 2020). While drones are not replacing traditional crop dusters,
    they can be a valuable addition to farming operations, especially when it comes
    to accessing tight spaces. However, there are many legal requirements to consider
    before purchasing a drone for spraying on a farm, and farmers must obtain legal
    approvals before using them (Alqarni et al., 2022, Santini et al., 2021). Fig.
    12 demonstrates the various applications of using drones in smart farming like
    harvesting, spraying, mapping and sensing. Download : Download high-res image
    (258KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Application of drones in
    agriculture sector (Kim et al., 2019). Agricultural mapping or land surveying
    drones are small computer-controlled aircraft outfitted with cameras to give farmers
    comprehensive information about their crops (Guo et al., 2019). The specific domain
    of land surveying and drone mapping has changed the agriculture industry (Dileep
    et al., 2020). For a land surveying project, surveyors are used to carrying heavy
    ground devices, such as, total stations to the field for measuring terrain depth,
    this may involve walking in dense vegetation or climbing up hills (Akpoti et al.,
    2019). Now, the ability to use drones for mapping the fieldwork of servers can
    be far more efficient and safer than before. Using drones to survey agricultural
    land took a few minutes with a camera to capture the data while the traditional
    methods could take many hours at a higher cost (Kulbacki et al., 2018). To learn
    the working of drones, understanding photogrammetry is necessary, it is the art
    and science of taking measurements from photographs (Elkhrachy, 2021). Triangulation
    is the fundamental idea behind photogrammetry (He et al., 2018). By taking pictures
    from at least two different places, lines of sight can be drawn from each camera
    to the object. In the photogrammetry processing software (Honarmand and Shahriari,
    2021), these lines of sight are mathematically intercepted to produce three-dimensional
    coordinates of the points of interest. For smart farmers, agricultural robot-drones
    automate slow, monotonous, and repetitive tasks, allowing them to concentrate
    more on increasing overall yields (Krishnan et al., 2020). Harvesting and picking
    weeds are two of agriculture''s most common uses for robot-drones (Oliveira et
    al., 2021). The most advanced drones when we need them to travel control centers
    send technicians with a fleet of pickers. After a short setup robot-drones select
    pick and box only ripe fruit ready for market (Nayyar et al., 2020). With robot-drones
    working day and night the applications provide real-time updates on the harvesting''s
    progress, duration, quantity picked, and price. Robot-drones are our future. A
    typical example of robot-drones for harvesting is VoloDrone. The VoloDrone, manufactured
    by the logistics company Schenker and the German VoloCopter, can transport goods
    weighing 150 to 200 kg. VoloDrone is a drone powered entirely by electricity that
    has a range of approximately 40 kg and can carry a payload of up to 200 kg. In
    traditional farming pesticide spraying on steep and mountainous fields is being
    treated with workers wearing 20 kg or more backpacks that walked through spraying
    the fields with all the chemicals all around them. Spraying drone is the innovation
    for the next generation of precision agriculture for agriculture fields built
    for pesticide and fertilizer spraying with a capacity of many liters (Klauser
    and Pauschinger, 2021). It is twice as cost-effective as using a helicopter and
    50 times faster than manually spraying (Fang et al., 2021). Following Table 5
    provides an overview of the tasks and applications of agricultural drones and
    robots in modern farming practices: Table 5. Drones and robots for sustainable
    farming. Task Description Reference Agricultural mapping or land surveying drones
    Small computer-controlled aircraft outfitted with cameras to give farmers comprehensive
    information about their crops. The use of drones for mapping has changed the agriculture
    industry. (Guo et al., 2019, Dileep et al., 2020, Akpoti et al., 2019, Kulbacki
    et al., 2018, Elkhrachy, 2021, He et al., 2018) Automation of slow, monotonous,
    and repetitive tasks Agricultural drones and robots are used to automate slow,
    monotonous, and repetitive tasks. The most common uses for robots in agriculture
    are harvesting and picking weeds. (Krishnan et al., 2020, Oliveira et al., 2021,
    Nayyar et al., 2020)  Harvesting and picking weeds with robots Harvesting and
    picking weeds are two of agriculture''s most common uses for robots. With real-time
    data and analytics tools at their disposal, farmers can make informed decisions,
    optimize their operations, and reduce costs while promoting sustainability. (Oliveira
    et al., 2021) Flying robots for harvesting Flying robots or drones select pick
    and box only ripe fruit ready for market. With flying robots working day and night,
    the applications provide real-time updates on the harvesting''s progress, duration,
    quantity picked, and price. A typical example of flying robots for harvesting
    is VoloDrone. (Nayyar et al., 2020, Klauser and Pauschinger, 2021) Pesticide and
    fertilizer spraying with drones Spraying drones are the innovation for the next
    generation of precision agriculture for agriculture fields built for pesticide
    and fertilizer spraying with a capacity of many liters. It is twice as cost-effective
    as using a helicopter and 50 times faster than manually spraying. (Klauser and
    Pauschinger, 2021, Fang et al., 2021)  2.5. Cloud-based data analytics for smart
    decision-making In modern agriculture, the availability of precise and complete
    data is crucial for optimal productivity. Luckily, the rise of AI-based smart
    farming platforms has provided farmers with an efficient solution for managing
    and analyzing agricultural data (Mendes et al., 2022). By using machine learning
    algorithms and user-friendly interfaces, these platforms enable farmers to gain
    valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. Utilizing images from Sentinel
    and Landsat satellites, agronomic parameters, soil moisture data, historic yield
    datasets, weather data, and evidence on soil types, these platforms apply AI and
    machine learning-trained models to transform inputs into logical analytics stored
    in the online cloud. This results in a comprehensive dataset that provides information
    on water stress, vegetation growth, nitrogen concentration, field productivity,
    and other factors that impact crop growth. Fig. 13 depicts the process flow of
    these smart farming platforms (Wang et al., 2022, Bahrami et al., 2021, Tagarakis
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (566KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. AgroSupportAnalytics Architecture and Components (Munir
    et al., 2022). Cloud computing in precision farming enables farmers to manage
    yield forecasting, weather monitoring, real-time data gathering, remote monitoring,
    and finances calculations, leading to increased production, water management,
    and precise farm and field evaluation. This helps farmers grow their margins and
    make investments to be more sustainable and profitable, making cloud computing
    based agriculture a reasonable way to achieve smart farming. Improving soil health,
    water conservation, and climate resilience in agriculture can lead to lower costs
    and higher yields and price premiums for crops or livestock, demonstrating the
    cycle between profitability and sustainability in natural resource industries
    (Sittón-Candanedo and Prieto, 2020, Parente et al., 2019). Using cloud-based technical
    practices in smart farming can increase profit and sustainability while reducing
    upfront costs and knowledge barriers. Researchers identified that back office
    tasks, such as paperwork, financial analysis, and decision-making, were often
    challenging for farmers, hindering their progress. Cloud computing platforms can
    simplify these tasks, saving farmers time and money (Paraforos and Griepentrog,
    2021, Moysiadis et al., 2021). Cloud platforms have revolutionized the way businesses
    store, process, and manage data, including data generated by IoT devices. They
    are a crucial part of many IoT systems because they offer scalable, adaptable,
    and affordable methods for managing huge amounts of data (Castillejo et al., 2020,
    Zerihun et al., 2022, Jagatheesan and Janaki, 2022, Qaisar et al., 2023). Here

    LoRaWAN technology Smart precision agriculture systems, which rely on advanced
    technologies like sensors, drones, and AI, require uninterrupted access to the
    internet for optimal performance. However, in rural areas of developing nations,
    this requirement often goes unfulfilled, leading to slower internet speeds and
    potential disruptions in data transmission. These interruptions can negatively
    impact decision-making and overall crop management, ultimately affecting yields
    and quality. Therefore, ensuring reliable and stable internet connectivity is
    critical for the success of smart precision agriculture systems, particularly
    in rural areas of developing nations (Philip and Williams, 2019). LoRaWAN technology
    typically operates within the frequency range of 862 MHz to 928 MHz, providing
    low-power, long-range connectivity for IoT devices, such as smart farming sensors.
    With low-power consumption, it enables extended battery life for these devices
    while transmitting data over long distances, independent of slow internet speeds
    or connectivity disruptions. This allows for precise decision-making, resulting
    in improved crop yields and quality. By incorporating LoRaWAN technology into
    farming practices, crop management can be optimized, resulting in increased profitability
    (Almuhaya et al., 2022, Oh and Lu, 2023). Following is comparison of LoRaWAN with
    other popular wireless communication technologies in Table 7: Table 7. Comparison
    of LoRaWAN with others wireless communication technologies. Technology Frequency

    Encryption Interoperable with Standards The main idea is to have some sort of
    device that periodically needs to send data over a long distance for a given amount
    of battery power, whatever gateway is nearest to these devices. In contrast to
    other connectivity technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth etc. LoRaWAN uses little
    power and devices supporting this technology are typically able to run on battery
    for months and years. If we add the fact that Lora hardware and sensors are relatively
    inexpensive one can easily understand why the adoption of LoRaWAN-based solutions
    has increased over the past years. LoRaWAN is a wonderful wireless technology
    that can work without the internet (Kuntke et al., 2021, Carotti et al., 2023).
    If the gateways are available far from the agriculture field area and near some
    urban areas having internet connection facilities, data from the fields can be
    gathered easily using LoRaWAN wireless technology to upload on the internet through
    a gateway. The gateway can further send this received data over some cloud to
    process and make suitable decision-making in crop activity management (Ojo et
    al., 2021, El-Ghamry et al., 2023). In the article (Codeluppi et al., 2020, Nakip
    et al., 2019), the author proposed an architecture LoRaFarm using Long Range wireless
    communication technology (LoRaWAN). LoRaWAN is a remarkable wireless communication
    technology that has been utilized in the architecture of LoRaFarm to improve the
    supervision of smart farms. The architecture of LoRaFarm is designed to provide
    a high degree of customization for farmers, permitting them to tailor the system
    to their specific needs. The efficacy of this architecture is demonstrated in
    Fig. 14, which depicts the seamless integration of LoRaWAN technology into the
    smart farming infrastructure. With LoRaWAN, farmers can access real-time data
    and take informed decisions, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.

    considerations for smart devices A critical advancement required in the agriculture
    sector is the efficient management of power consumption in smart devices. The
    major common requirement for almost all IoT device modules is power consumption
    and extensive battery life (Callebaut et al., 2021). In IoT-based smart systems,
    power is a critical constraint, and to reduce power consumption in smart devices
    different mechanisms are being used (Sanislav et al., 2021). The stored data of
    IoT clouds provide the optimal values for the power and device conditions. This
    section is about technical solutions to the power constraint issue of smart devices
    and how to ensure maximum battery life with a look at design choices and power-saving
    features. Charging the IoT device several times a week is not what people consider
    low-power battery-operated devices, it is a hardware design of low-power devices
    and the main burden of achieving low-power savings devices is on the designer
    (Rajaiyan et al., 2022). The performance of a smart IoT device can be optimized
    by selecting the right module and component mix, while considering power savings
    and network support requirements. Careful configuration of the module''s features
    and behavior is also necessary to maximize battery life, which is impacted by
    data speed and traffic. Faster data speeds and higher data transmission requirements
    consume more battery power. Therefore, it is essential to understand the latency
    of battery life to improve device performance (Sarker et al., 2020). Power issues
    are a significant challenge for IoT devices due to their wireless transmission
    and network low efficiency. These devices need to be highly energy-efficient to
    ensure that they can operate for extended periods without recharging or replacing
    the battery. Here are some power issues and solutions with different technologies
    for IoT devices: 2.7.1. Battery’s life Most IoT devices run on batteries that
    have a limited lifespan, and they need to be replaced or recharged regularly (Callebaut
    et al., 2021). A solution to this is to use energy harvesting technologies, such
    as, solar, thermal, or kinetic energy harvesters to generate energy for the device
    (Iqbal et al., 2021). This reduces the need for frequent battery replacements
    and increases the lifespan of the device. 2.7.2. Power consumption IoT devices
    frequently consume a lot of electricity, which might reduce battery life (Rajaiyan
    et al., 2022). Using low-power microcontrollers and wireless technologies like
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Zigbee is one way. These innovations use a lot less
    energy than conventional Wi-Fi or cellular communication, which prolongs the life
    of the device''s battery. In (Doshi and Patel, 2019), authors suggested an Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based smart farming system that makes use of sensors and an ESP32
    NodeMCU to identify and stop agricultural diseases while also giving vital environmental
    data, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The system can run for
    up to 15 days with a 6000 mAh power bank and efficient power usage estimations,
    extending the power bank''s lifespan and enabling more reliable crop monitoring
    and management. 2.7.2.1. Energy efficiency To enable prolonged operation without
    recharging or battery replacement, IoT devices must be extremely energy-efficient
    (Rana et al., 2021). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can
    be used to optimise the device''s power usage as a solution to this problem. These
    algorithms are able to spot patterns in the energy use of the gadget and modify
    its operations accordingly. 2.7.3. Power management Power management is critical
    to ensure that the device is not draining power when it is not in use. One solution
    is to use sleep modes, where the device enters a low-power state when it is not
    in use. This helps to conserve battery life and ensure that the device is always
    ready to operate when needed (Iqbal et al., 2021). 2.7.4. Wireless charging Wireless
    charging is a convenient solution to the battery life issue for IoT devices. This
    technology allows the device to charge wirelessly, eliminating the need for regular
    battery replacements or recharging. This technology is becoming more widely available
    and can be integrated into IoT devices (La Rosa et al., 2019). 2.7.5. Energy harvesting
    using natural resources for powering smart devices Natural resources, such as
    wind, agriculture machines vibrations, temperature gradients, and sunlight can
    be used to produce useful energy. Energy harvesting reduces the dependence on
    batteries and wires by utilizing the energy present around the device, which brings
    many benefits like enabling new applications and features and reducing costs (Izhar
    and Khan, 2023.). Power can be harvested from temperature gradients, movement
    vibrations, radio frequency signals, and solar light, as depicted in Fig. 15.

    these power issues with the solutions offered by different technologies, IoT devices
    can improve their performance, reduce energy consumption, and prolong battery
    life. The Table 8 below summarizes the power issues that can affect IoT devices,
    along with various solutions using different technologies to address them. Table

    the management of the agricultural supply chain is being transformed by blockchain
    technology. It enables consistent tracking of agricultural products from farms
    to table by offering a transparent and unchangeable record. This invention increases
    accountability, decreases deception, and ensures the authenticity of food products.
    The adoption of blockchain technology in intelligent agriculture marks a significant
    advancement towards a more secure and stable supply chain management landscape
    (Jamil et al., 2022). 3. Sustainability in smart farming Smart farming techniques
    and approaches along with their ongoing advancements, are instrumental in achieving
    effective agriculture management and sustainability. These innovations optimize
    resource utilization, enhance productivity, and contribute to eco-friendly practices.
    Boosting the economies of developing nations can play a crucial role in addressing
    the issue of poverty that the world is currently facing. Since most of these countries''
    economies are based on agriculture, it becomes imperative to focus on resource
    efficiency in agriculture to ensure sustainable development and poverty reduction.
    The global population currently exceeds seven billion, and according to estimates
    from the World Food Program (WFP), 768 million people suffered from chronic hunger
    in 2020 as shown in Fig. 16, with the number expected to rise to 828 million in
    2022 (Sniatala et al., 2022). Additionally, over 155 million people, equivalent
    to 2 % of the world''s population, experienced severe hunger in 2022 and required
    urgent assistance (Wudil et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (52KB)

    et al., 2022). The following Table 9, presents a discussion on the role of IoT-based
    smart farming in achieving the SDGs. Table 9. Smart farming in the SDGs perspective.
    S. No SDGs IoT-based Smart Farming role to the SDGs References 1 No Poverty Smart
    farming technologies can empower rural communities to improve their financial
    well-being and reduce poverty through efficient use of resources and increased
    productivity. (Goel et al., 2021, Tripathi et al., 2022, Bhattacharya and Sachdev,
    xxxx) 2 End Hunger The use of smart technologies can help increase agricultural
    productivity and improve food security, ultimately contributing to the goal of
    ending hunger. (Musa and Basir, 2021, Chigwada et al., 2022:e01398., Suhail et
    al., 2021) 3 Good Health and Well-being Smart farming can reduce the use of harmful
    pesticides, improving the health and well-being of both farmers and consumers.
    (Adamides et al., 2020, Mohamed et al., 2021) 6 Clean Water and Sanitation Smart
    irrigation techniques can help ensure the efficient use of water resources, providing
    access to clean water and contributing to better crop yields. (Suhail et al.,
    2021) 7 Affordable and Clean Energy IoT-based smart farming can be powered by
    renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, reducing reliance on fossil fuels
    and contributing to the goal of clean and affordable energy for all. (Al-Ali et
    al., 2019, Lin et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2018) 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth
    The adoption of smart agricultural technologies using AI and IoT can create new
    job opportunities and contribute to economic growth in rural areas. (Yoon et al.,
    2018, Senthil Kumar et al., 2021) 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure IoT-based
    smart farming represents a new frontier for innovation in agriculture and can
    contribute to sustainable industrialization. (Martos et al., 2021) 11 Sustainable
    Cities and Communities By encouraging the more effective use of resources and
    minimising waste, smart water management systems and productive vertical farming
    can aid in the development of sustainable cities and communities. (Singh et al.,
    2022, Santini et al., 2021, Le Roux et al., 2018) 12 Responsible Consumption and
    Production AI-based IoT precision agriculture can help ensure responsible resource
    management and reduce waste, particularly with respect to water consumption. (Patil
    and Khairnar, 2022, Lahlou et al., 2023) 13 Climate Action Smart farming techniques
    can help mitigate the impacts of climate change by enhancing agricultural yields
    and improving water management. (Stein, 2021, Diez et al., 2022) 14 Life Below
    Water Compared to conventional irrigation systems, IoT-based precision agriculture
    uses less water, helping to protect life below water. (Bwambale et al., 2022,
    Singh et al., 2022, Le Roux et al., 2018) 15 Life on Land In order to protect
    life on land, smart farming has the ability to boost food production, enhance
    food quality, and lessen agriculture''s negative environmental effects. (Javaid
    et al., 2022, Poudel et al., 2020) We can strive towards reaching the UN SDGs
    by putting IoT-based smart farming technology into practise. Smart farming has
    the ability to revolutionise the agricultural industry and provide a more sustainable
    future for all, from decreasing poverty to battling climate change. The aforementioned
    chart outlines some of the major areas where IoT-based smart farming can have
    an impact, such as enhancing food security, fostering renewable energy, and guaranteeing
    responsible resource management. We can create a more durable and just world for
    future generations if we use the power of smart farming. The UN SDGs can be achieved
    with the help of IoT-based smart farming technology, especially in the area of
    sustainable farming. Smart farming can assist us in addressing some of the most
    serious issues confronting our world today, such as poverty and climate change,
    by improving resource efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing output (Alam,
    2023). As we look towards a more sustainable future, it is essential that we continue
    to invest in smart farming and other innovative solutions that can help us build
    a more resilient and equitable world for all. 4. Findings and discussion Smart
    farming practices can positively impact several aspects aligned with UN’s SDGs,
    including poverty reduction, improved food production, health enhancement through
    nutritious crops, efficient water use, renewable energy implementation, job creation,
    technological progress, and environmental responsibility. However, SDGs like Quality
    Education, Gender Equality, Reduced Inequality, Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions,
    and Partnerships for the Goals require broader socio-economic and educational
    actions beyond the smart farming. While smart farming contributes to sustainable
    development, its scope is limited in addressing complex societal issues beyond
    agriculture. IoT-based smart farming has enormous potential to help achieve the
    SDGs, but there are several challenges that need to be addressed for successful
    implementation. A comprehensive review of various research endeavors concerning
    the attainment of SDGs, as outlined in Table 9, reveals that 12 out of 17 SDGs
    can be realized through effective management of agricultural systems. These attainable
    SDGs are listed in Fig. 17, while Fig. 18 presents a comparative graph showcasing
    the achievable and unachievable SDGs. Download : Download high-res image (512KB)

    Fig. 18. Graph of achievable vs unachievable SDGs. The comparison graph illustrates
    the findings of the sustainability study in Section 4, showing that 12 of the
    17 SDGs are reachable through effective agricultural practises. The very diverse
    nature of data in smart farming, which can vary dependent on criteria including
    data type, format, and purpose, is one of the major challenges. Farmers that need
    to incorporate data from various sources into their smart farming networks have
    a hurdle as a result. Standardization of protocols across devices and technology
    providers is required to solve this problem. Farmers also encounter difficulties
    with implementation due to the absence of modern communication networks and services
    in rural areas. In order to enable the adoption of IoT-based smart farming solutions,
    this limitation necessitates investments in the development of rural infrastructure
    (Alex et al., 2023). Additionally, farmers'' lack of technological expertise has
    a significant impact on the adoption of IoT and AI approaches in the field. The
    necessity for capacity-building and training programmes to give farmers the abilities
    they need to implement and sustain smart farming technologies is highlighted by
    this gap. Finally, a cloud computing system is necessary to store and analyse
    enormous amounts of data simultaneously. However, the computing capacity of IoT
    devices is often low, making it difficult to integrate all the functionalities
    into a single chip or system. IoT solutions that effectively employ resources
    and scale to support a large number of devices simultaneously must be created
    in order to address this issue. In conclusion, while IoT-based smart farming offers
    significant potential to help achieve sustainable development goals, it is critical
    to address the challenges highlighted in this discussion. By working towards standardization
    of protocols, investing in rural infrastructure development, providing technical
    training and capacity building, and developing scalable IoT solutions, we can
    overcome these challenges and ensure the successful implementation of smart farming
    technologies. 5. Future recommendations The challenges facing the global food
    system are significant, and sustainable development indicators fall short in numerous
    areas. However, IoT-based agriculture management techniques for sustainable farming
    highlights the potential of AI and IoT to revolutionize sustainability in the
    agricultural sector. Sustainable development and industry need not be at odds
    with one another, and the transformative power of AI and IoT-based smart farming
    technology can prioritize food and nutrition security while reversing environmental
    degradation and adapting to climate change. Widespread adoption of these technologies
    is essential to build a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable world for generations
    to come. As researchers, we recognize the urgency of this global transition and
    promote the adoption of new technologies for a more sustainable future. 5.1. Impact
    of smart farming on sustainability The adoption of AI and IoT in smart farming
    technologies has the potential to completely transform agricultural sustainability.
    These strategies can also help with climate change adaptation and reversing environmental
    degradation by placing a high priority on food and nutrition security (Koutridi
    and Christopoulou, 2023). Adopting smart farming practises can result in more
    effective resource usage, less environmental impact, and improved agricultural
    sustainability. 5.2. Key challenges and opportunities for implementation Despite
    the positive effects that smart farming has the potential to provide, there are
    obstacles to implementation. High initial expenses, a lack of technological availability
    in rural locations, and the requirement for specialised expertise are a few examples.
    To overcome these obstacles, it is necessary to invest in infrastructure, capacity-building
    initiatives, and legislative support that will encourage the wider use of smart
    agricultural technologies (Zhao et al., 2023). 5.3. Recommendations for future
    smart farming initiatives To fully realize the potential of smart farming, it
    is essential to promote research and development in AI and IoT-based technologies.
    Collaboration between governments, private sectors, and research institutions
    can facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation in the agricultural sector. Additionally,
    offering incentives and financial support to farmers for adopting smart farming
    practices can accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and technologically
    advanced agriculture industry. By fostering a supportive ecosystem for smart farming,
    we can create a brighter and more sustainable future for agriculture and global
    food security. 6. Conclusions Traditional farming practices are incapable of coping
    with the today''s food production and its quality and security requirement due
    to the exponential population explosion of the world, especially Pakistan. To
    address this challenge, researchers have been delving into the usage of intillegent
    techniques transforming into the modern IoT-based farming practices as predicted,
    automated, efficient and sustainable solution. IoT-based agriculture management
    techniques hold immense promise for advancing sustainability in agriculture farming
    due to its wide range of sensing and monitoring applications. This review article
    emphasizes their alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as
    poverty reduction, food production enhancement, efficient resource utilization,
    renewable energy adoption, job creation, and environmental responsibility. However,
    challenges such as data heterogeneity, rural infrastructure limitations, and the
    need for farmer technical literacy must be addressed through standardization,
    infrastructure development, and capacity-building creativities. AI and IoT''s
    integration can transform agricultural sustainability, prioritizing food security,
    reversing environmental degradation, and adapting to climate change. Widespread
    technology implementation is pivotal for fostering a resilient, equitable, and
    sustainable agricultural future. CRediT authorship contribution statement Hammad

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction An Essential requirement for sustainable
    agriculture is to reduce the amount of agrochemicals used in farming, such as
    herbicides and pesticides, to decrease their negative impact on the environment
    [1], [2]. In this context, autonomous agricultural robots equipped with vision-based
    systems offer the potential to address this issue by deploying plant classification
    systems that automatically identify crops and weeds to perform targeted interventions
    in the field [3]. Most recent vision-based systems deploy convolutional neural
    networks (CNNs) to perform a semantic segmentation of soil, crops, and weeds in
    agricultural fields. Generally, these models are trained on a single dataset,
    i.e., the source domain, consisting of a set of images and its corresponding dense
    annotations, providing for each pixel its corresponding ground truth class. While
    achieving impressive results on images visually similar to the source domain,
    deploying these models on unseen agricultural fields, i.e., the target domain,
    results in a substantial performance decrease indicating a low generalization
    ability [4]. We attribute this to the domain gap between the source and target
    domain, i.e., the images of the source domain contain a limited view of plant
    varieties and growth stages and are restricted to a certain image style. Achieving
    domain generalization is essential for real-world deployment of precision farming
    robots operating in various fields [5]. In this paper, we address the issue of
    domain generalized semantic segmentation to reliably identify soil, crops, and
    weeds in images of arbitrary agricultural fields. The main contribution of this
    paper is an end-to-end trainable pipeline for domain generalized semantic segmentation
    that achieves high performance in various agricultural fields. We leverage unlabeled
    images that we exploit during training to extend and diversify the source domain
    and increase the models'' generalization capability, as sketched in Fig. 1. Our
    method does not need extra manual labeling and is simple to wrap into many network
    architectures. In sum, we make three key claims. First, we propose a method to
    leverage unlabeled images of various agricultural fields during training that
    achieves high generalization capabilities compared to conventionally trained semantic
    segmentation networks. Second, our framework performs superior to several domain
    adaptation methods that, contrary to ours, require image samples from the target
    domain. Lastly, our approach outperforms other domain generalization methods.
    Our implementation and datasets are available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/DG-CWS.
    Fig. 1. We propose a vision-based method to develop domain generalized semantic
    segmentation models by leveraging unlabeled images from various fields that reliably
    segments soil, crops, and weeds in arbitrary agricultural fields. We present methods
    to compute sparse annotation for these images automatically and to perform a style
    diversification of source domain images. We exploit both methods to train CNNs
    achieving high performance in various fields. Show All SECTION II. Related Work
    Several vision-based approaches have been proposed for semantic segmentation in
    agricultural fields using handcrafted features [6], [7] or CNN-based methods [1],
    [2], [8]. Below, we aim to provide a broad overview of semantic segmentation methods
    and approaches to mitigate the performance decrease for unseen target domains.
    Semantic Segmentation: Most current methods use CNNs for semantic segmentation
    of images from agricultural fields to predict a pixel-wise classification. Milioto
    et al. [9] propose a vision-based classification system based on CNNs to distinguish
    crops and weeds. Initially, they apply a preprocessing step to separate vegetation
    from soil and subsequently perform a classification on cropped regions to distinguish
    crops and weeds. McCool et al. [8] combine multiple lightweight CNN models to
    a mixture model to perform a fast and accurate weed segmentation on agricultural
    robots. Contrary to our approach, these methods are trained on a single source
    domain and thus show low generalization capabilities when applied to various unseen
    target domains [4]. Domain Adaptation: Several works address the generalization
    issue by adapting the images of the source domain to the target domain [4], [10],
    [11]. Generally, these methods require image samples from the target domain to
    perform the adaptation. Subsequently, they train a CNN based on the adapted images
    of the source domain and deploy this model to the target domain to mitigate the
    decrease in performance. Park et al. [11] generate images in the source domain
    that have the appearance of the target domain but explicitly preserve content
    by maximizing the mutual information between corresponding image patches with
    contrastive learning. Cherian et al. [10] emphasize that the semantic classes
    of the original and adapted image should be identical. Accordingly, they present
    a method that enforces semantic consistency during domain adaptation to achieve
    realistically adapted images. Gogoll et al. [4] propose an unsupervised domain
    adaptation for plant segmentation using generative adversarial networks. They
    assume a single dataset containing images and ground truth annotations as the
    source domain and image samples of the target domain without annotations. Next,
    they adapt images of the source domain to the target domain and train a CNN using
    the adapted dataset that achieves increased performance in the target domain.
    These methods require images from the target domain to perform the adaptation,
    which limits their applicability. Domain Generalization: In contrast, domain generalization
    [12] overcomes this limitation and aims at training robust CNNs that achieve high
    performance in arbitrary unseen domains. Contrary to domain adaption, any image
    of the target domain is unavailable before deploying the model. Hendrycks et al.
    [13] propose a data augmentation procedure to diversify the source domain during
    training. Specifically, they compute multiple augmented versions of the original
    image and effectively combine them into a single augmented image. Their method
    achieves high generalization capability and performs robustly on multiple target
    domains. In contrast, Choi et al. [14] propose to enhance the generalization capability
    of CNNs by introducing an objective function to encourage the network to be invariant
    to the image style of the source domain. They exploit covariance matrices from
    feature maps and remove correlations related to variation in image style. Thus,
    their method is less sensitive to domain-specific styles but focuses on domain-invariant
    content. Unlike our approach, these methods do either not exploit unlabeled images
    and eventually operate within the source domain or do not utilize automatically
    computed sparse annotations based on unlabeled images. We leverage images of various
    fields to increase domain generalization capabilities by using sparse annotations
    and exploiting various image styles. SECTION III. Our Approach The main objective
    of our approach is to develop a model based on CNNs that enables agricultural
    robots to perform a reliable semantic segmentation of the classes soil, crop,
    and weed in various agricultural fields, even when the source and target domain
    differ substantially. We propose a method to train domain generalized semantic
    segmentation models that achieve high performance on RGB images captured by unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) across different agricultural
    fields. First, we describe in Section III-A the conventional training procedure
    of semantic segmentation models and its deficiencies regarding domain generalization.
    We propose to address these issues by leveraging unlabeled images captured from
    various agricultural fields during training in a two-step framework. In Section
    III-B and III-C we present a method to automatically compute sparse annotations
    for these images and subsequently exploit them during training by computing objective
    functions on a subset of pixels, see Section III-D. This enables us to extend
    the intra-class content of the source domain to provide our model with wide plant
    varieties at different growth stages and soil conditions to improve its generalization
    capability. Furthermore, we argue that the image style of the source domain is
    severely restricted, thus facilitating overfitting to the source style. Consequently,
    we exploit the unlabeled images in Section III-E and propose a style transfer
    method based on a whitening and coloring transformation that diversifies the source
    domain by rendering its images in various real-world styles. In Section III-F,
    we exploit these images during training to alleviate overfitting. In sum, we utilize
    densely and sparsely annotated images and style-transferred versions of densely
    annotated images. Finally, we provide implementation details in Section III-G.
    A. Supervised Semantic Segmentation The key task of supervised semantic segmentation
    with CNNs is to train a network ϕ that provides for an RGB image x∈ R H×W×3 a
    corresponding prediction p∈ R H×W×K , which models pixel-wise a categorical distribution
    of K possible classes. Let H and W denote the height and width of an image, respectively.
    In supervised semantic segmentation, we have access to the source domain dataset
    D s ={( x s , y s )} with | D s |=N , containing N pairs of RGB images x s ∈ R
    H×W×3 and corresponding ground truth annotations y s ∈ Z H×W×K , which contain
    for each pixel a one-hot encoded vector over K classes. Thus, each image in the
    source domain is densely annotated. For our task, K=3 since we define the classes
    soil, crop, and weed. During training, we follow best practice and minimize the
    cross-entropy objective to optimize the models'' parameters: L s dense ( y s ,
    p s )=− 1 HW ∑ h=1 H ∑ w=1 W ∑ k=1 K y s hwk log( p s hwk ), (1) View Source where
    p s =ϕ( x s ) represents the model prediction. While deploying ϕ on images similar
    to the source domain results in impressive performance, it often fails to perform
    appropriately on other target domains due to the domain gap and its low generalization
    capability [13], [14]. We attribute this to a limited source domain with a restricted
    set of plant varieties, growth stages, and soil conditions, which occur in various
    target domains. Additionally, the model ϕ tends to overfit to the image styles
    provided in the source domain [14] since the set of x s is captured with a limited
    variability of illumination. However, increasing the generalization capability
    by providing a large-scale source domain with dense annotations covering a wide
    range of plant varieties and image styles is not viable since the annotations
    are typically acquired manually and, thus, time- and labor-intensive. Contrary,
    we propose an approach to leverage unlabeled, real-world images of various agricultural
    fields. Next, we present our method to automatically compute sparse annotations
    for these images that does not require manual intervention and subsequently exploit
    them during training to increase the generalization capabilities. B. Sparse Annotations
    for Soil and Crops First, we propose an approach to obtain sparse annotations
    for soil and crops in images of conventionally cultivated fields containing crops
    sown in rows by exploiting the spatial arrangement. In this work, we refer to
    sparse annotations as a subset of pixels with associated ground truth classes
    that we leverage during training to extend the source domain. First, we employ
    redness [15] and greenness [16] indices to obtain binary masks of pixels belonging
    to soil and vegetation. Subsequently, we detect a crop row by a Hough transform
    and exploit this information to filter out pixels belonging to weeds [17]. Finally,
    we obtain sparse annotations for pixels belonging to soil or crops, as shown in
    Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Our method to automatically compute sparse annotations for soil
    and crops in images x c of cultivated fields. First, we compute soil masks S c
    and vegetation mask V c . However, these masks may still contain pixels associated
    to weeds. Thus, we detect a crop row, denoted as R c . Finally, we generate restricted
    masks S ^ c and V ^ c to consider only pixels along the row in the final sparse
    annotation y c . Show All Similar to related work [15], [16], we first convert
    an RGB image x c ∈ R H×W×3 of a conventionally cultivated crop field to the HSV
    color space and denote its hue channel as H c , where each pixel H c hw ∈[ 0 ∘
    , 360 ∘ ) . The value 0 ∘ indicates red pixels, 120 ∘ green pixels, and 240 ∘
    blue pixels. Subsequently, we compute a binary soil mask S c ∈ Z H×W by a thresholding
    operation defined as: S c hw ={ 1, if  H c hw ≤ 45 ∘ ∨ H c hw ≥ 315 ∘ 0, otherwise
    , (2) View Source and a binary vegetation mask V c ∈ Z H×W : V c hw ={ 1, if  50
    ∘ ≤ H c hw ≤ 175 ∘ 0, otherwise . (3) View Source Since our primary aim is to
    generate sparse annotations covering a fraction of all pixels, our method allows
    setting the thresholds conservatively to detect some pixels that are likely to
    belong to soil or vegetation but not all of them. Thus, we do not fine-tune the
    thresholds to stress that the method''s heuristics are broadly applicable on crop
    row fields. As highlight by red circles in Fig. 2 these masks may still contain
    undesired pixel belonging to weeds. Thus, we suggest to detect a single crop row
    in V c by applying a Hough transform to constrain the vegetation pixels in V c
    to crops and remove weeds. The Hough transform computes based on V c for each
    parameter θ and r of a line in the polar system l:y=−tan(θ ) −1 x+rsin(θ ) −1
    its support in terms of vegetation pixels belonging to l , where y∈[1,H] and x∈[1,W]
    . Note that we restrict the parameter space of θ to θ≤20 ∘ ∨θ≥340 ∘ and thus consider
    only lines approximately vertical. This assumption is based on the fact that common
    farming robots capture images along vertical crop rows [2], [18]. Since the number
    of crop rows is variable, we suggest to identify the single most dominant line
    l ^ with the most support in the Hough space. Therefore, we miss some rows, but
    we aim for correct annotations and do not want to introduce wrong labels. Next,
    we compute a binary crop row mask R c ∈ Z H×W : R c hw ={ 1, if d( l ^ ,(h,w))≤ϵ
    0, otherwise , (4) View Source where d( l ^ ,(h,w)) is the orthogonal distance
    between the line and a pixel location (h,w) . Thus, R c contains the crop row
    with a width of ϵ , see Fig. 2. Since our images x c have a ground sampling distance
    (GSD) between 0.33mm/px and 1mm/px , we set ϵ to 35px to cover a reasonable width
    between 11.5mm and 35mm for small and large crops. As before, we state that a
    precise fine-tuning of ϵ is not required since we aim to obtain sparse annotations
    only. Following, we constrain the binary masks S c and V c to pixels belonging
    to the crop row inherent in R c . Intuitively, since crops are cultivated along
    rows, we are confident that the restricted set of pixels belongs to soil or crops
    but not weeds. We define the constrained binary soil mask as S ^ c : S ^ c hw
    ={ 1, if  R c hw =1∧ S c hw =1 0, otherwise , (5) View Source and similarly the
    constrained binary vegetation mask V ^ c : V ^ c hw ={ 1, if  R c hw =1∧ V c hw
    =1 0, otherwise . (6) View Source We exploit both constrained binary masks to
    generate the sparse ground truth annotation y c ∈ Z H×W×K . We assign each pixel
    with S ^ c hw =1 to the class soil and each pixel with V ^ c hw =1 to the class
    crop, see Fig. 2. We define A c as the set of automatically annotated pixels in
    x c and emphasize that the annotations of the remaining pixels are undefined.
    Ultimately, our proposed procedure enables us to generate an automatically, sparsely
    annotated soil-versus-crop dataset D c ={( x c , y c )} , with | D c |=M , based
    on M images captured from various conventionally cultivated fields that we exploit
    during training, see Section III-D. We tested our procedure on sugar beet fields,
    but we believe it is generic to any crop in cultivated fields sown in rows. C.
    Sparse Annotations for Soil and Weeds Additionally, we automatically compute sparse
    annotations for soil and weeds based on images of uncultivated fields, i.e., agricultural
    wastelands not containing any target crops. Let x w ∈ R H×W×3 be an RGB image
    of an uncultivated field. We compute the binary soil and vegetation mask as shown
    in (2) and (3). Consequently, we denote them as S w and V w and illustrate them
    in Fig. 3. However, in this case, we do not enforce any further constraint on
    the binary masks since x w contains only soil and weed. Fig. 3. Our method to
    automatically compute sparse annotations for soil and weed in images x w of uncultivated
    fields. We exploit soil masks S w and vegetation mask V w to get sparse annotations
    y w . Show All Next, we exploit the unconstrained binary masks to generate the
    sparse ground truth annotation y w ∈ Z H×W×K . We assign each pixel with S w hw
    =1 to the class soil and with V w hw =1 to the class weed, see Fig. 3. We define
    A w as the set of automatically annotated pixels in x w and stress that the annotations
    of the remaining pixels are undefined. We compute these annotations for T images
    captured at various uncultivated fields to generate a sparsely annotated soil-versus-weed
    dataset D w ={( x w , y w )} with | D w |=T . In the following, we exploit D c
    and D w during training. D. Training With Sparse Annotations A key reason for
    the low generalization capability of conventionally trained CNNs is that the source
    domain contains limited source content [12], e.g., an insufficient amount of plant
    varieties and growth stages with constrained soil conditions. We address this
    issue by additionally involving the sparsely annotated datasets D c and D w during
    training. Conventionally, a network ϕ processes an image x s and computes pixel-wise
    an objective function to optimize the models'' parameters by minimizing (1). Contrary,
    we additionally process an image x c from D c during training to obtain its predictions
    p c =ϕ( x c ) . Next, we propose to compute the cross-entropy objective effectively
    on the subset of pixels A c belonging to sparse annotations: L c sparse ( y c
    , p c )=− 1 |A c | ∑ i=1 |A c | y c i log( p c i ). (7) View Source By minimizing
    (7), we present the network with extended content of real fields and enhance the
    generalization capabilities by enforcing the correct class for various crops in
    different soil conditions and prevent false weed predictions. We further increase
    the intra-class content and process additionally an image x w from D w . Like
    previously, we compute the cross-entropy function based on the set of sparsely
    annotated pixels in A w and denote the corresponding objective as L w sparse (
    y w , p w ) . We minimize this objective to train our network on various weeds
    that occur in differing soil conditions and penalize false crop predictions. E.
    Source Image Style Diversification Another cause of low generalization capability
    is the often limited image style of the source domain [14] that does not cover
    the variety of illumination that occurs at various locations in images of real
    fields. Thus, we propose a method to diversify the style of images in the source
    domain. Specifically, we apply a whitening and color transformation (WCT) to transform
    an image in the source domain such that it inherits the covariance matrix [19]
    of an image in D c or D w , which cover various real-world conditions. Chiu et
    al. [19] show that the WCT achieves good results among different approaches as
    it effectively transforms the style but preserves the content. Finally, we perform
    an alpha blending an denote our method as WCTA. Next, we describe the three-step
    procedure of our WCTA using an image pair x s and x c . Whitening Transformation.
    In this step, we employ a whitening transformation [19] to compute a representation
    of the image x s such that its color channels are uncorrelated and have unit variance.
    First, we specify f s ∈ R 3×HW as a reshaped version of x s that contains its
    RGB values row-wise. Before whitening, we center f s by subtracting its mean m
    s ∈ R 3×1 and denote its centered version as f ¯ s ∈ R 3×HW . Let Q s ∈ R 3×3
    be an orthogonal matrix containing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix Σ
    s = 1 HW−1 f ¯ s f ¯ s ⊤ and Λ s ∈ R 3×3 be the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
    We perform the whitening as following: f ^ s = Q s Λ s − 1 2 Q s ⊤ f ¯ s , (8)
    View Source such that f ^ s f ^ s ⊤ = I 3 holds true for f ^ s ∈ R 3×HW . Coloring
    Transformation: Next, we aim to transfer the covariance matrix of a sparsely annotated
    image x c to the result of the previous operation. This procedure provides a representation
    of the image x s that is visually similar to x c but preserves its content [19].
    As previously, we denote f c ∈ R 3×HW as the reshaped version of x c and subtract
    its mean vector m c ∈ R 3×1 to obtain a centered representation f ¯ c . Let Q
    c ∈ R 3×3 contain the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix Σ c and Λ c ∈ R 3×3
    be the diagonal matrix of associated eigenvalues. Next, we perform the coloring:
    f ^ sc = Q c Λ c 1 2 Q c ⊤ f ^ s , (9) View Source which essentially represents
    an inverse whitening. This transformation ensures that f ^ sc ∈ R 3×HW has the
    desired correlations between its color channels, i.e., f ^ sc f ^ s c ⊤ = f ¯
    c f ¯ c ⊤ . Thus, the transformed image f ^ sc inherits the covariance matrix
    of the sparsely annotated image f c . Finally, we recenter the transformed image
    f ^ sc = f ^ sc + m c and perform a reshaping to obtain the transformed image
    x sc ∈ R H×W×3 , see Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Our proposed WCTA diversifies the style of
    source domain images x s , e.g., we transfer the style from an image x c to x
    s , where α denotes the controllable transformation strength. Show All Alpha Blending:
    Next, we propose a method to combine an image x s and its transformed representation
    x sc by a parameter α∈[0,1] that controlls the transformation strength: x sc =α
    x s +(1−α) x sc . (10) View Source Using α=0 exploits the color transformation
    entirely, α=1 preserves the original image x s , and intermediate values of α
    combine both representations proportionally. Since we aim to diversify the source
    domain, we randomly sample α from a uniform distribution in the interval [0,1]
    , see Fig. 4. We perform the WCTA also for image pairs x s and x w since x w covers
    yet another set of real-world conditions, see Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Our framework to
    train a semantic segmentation model ϕ that has high generalization capabilities.
    Besides training on images x s and dense annotations y s we suggest to process
    images x c and x w from various fields and propose an automatic procedure to compute
    their sparse annotations y c and y w . Additionally, we perform a style transfer
    method (WCTA) to obtain images x sc and x sw with annotations y s and exploit
    them also during training. Show All F. Training With Style-Diversified Source
    Images Next, we exploit the WCTA during training to alleviate overfitting to the
    restricted source style. Particularly, we propose in Section III-D to process
    images x c and x w additionally to an image x s to increase intra-class content
    variability based on their sparse annotations. Next, we additionally exploit x
    c and x w to compute style-diversified representations x sc and x sw of the source
    image that serve as additional inputs to the network, see Fig. 5. Consequently,
    we obtain their corresponding predictions p sc =ϕ( x sc ) and p sw =ϕ( x sw )
    that are both ∈ R H×W×K . Since the style-diversified images x sc and x sw have
    the same semantic content as x s (see Fig. 5) their ground truth annotation is
    y s . Thus, we compute the cross-entropy similiar as in (1) and denote the objective
    using the style-diversified image x sc as L sc dense ( y s , p sc ) and using
    x sw as L sw dense ( y s , p sw ) . By minimizing these objectives, we enforce
    the network to capture correct semantic classes for images with the same content
    but different styles to achieve domain generalization. G. Implementation Details
    We employ ERFNet [20] and DeepLabV3+ based on ResNet-50 [21], [22] as possible
    segmentation networks ϕ and report the results for both to show that our proposed
    method to increase the generalization capability is network-agnostic. The former
    aims at efficiency and has a small number of parameters, i.e., 2.1⋅ 10 6 , while
    the latter is a high capacity architecture with 39.8⋅ 10 6 parameters. We train
    each model for 4096 epochs using the Adam optimization [23] with a batch size
    of 4 and a weight decay of 2⋅ 10 −4 . At the initial 16 epochs, we linearly increase
    the learning rate to 1⋅ 10 −4 and subsequently apply a polynomial learning rate
    decay (1− e 4096 ) 3 , where e is the current epoch. During training, we randomly
    crop patches of size 768px×768px from each input image and use standard data augmentation
    methods, i.e., random adjustment of brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation,
    as well as random scaling and horizontal or vertical flipping. At each training
    step we pass a quintet of images, i.e., x s , x c , x w , x sc , and x sw , to
    our network and define the final loss function as a uniformly weighted sum of
    L s dense , L c sparse , L w sparse , L sc dense , and L sw dense , as shown in
    Fig. 5. Thus, we set the weight of each loss equal to one to avoid overfitting
    to any specific domain. During inference, we pass a single image to our network
    to obtain its associated semantic segmentation. SECTION IV. Experimental Evaluation
    In our experimental evaluation, we support our key claims that are: (i) We present
    a method that achieves high generalization capabilities compared to conventionally
    trained semantic segmentation networks, (ii) our framework performs superior to
    several domain adaptation methods, and (iii) our approach to exploit unlabeled
    images of various fields outperforms several domain generalization methods that
    eventually operate within the source domain. Datasets: For the source domain D
    s , we deployed an UAV to collect a dataset from an agricultural field in Bonn
    that consists of RGB images captured over one month, see Table I. These images
    contain sugar beets between the 2- and 12 leaf growth stages and serve a substantial
    amount of different weed types. We use 70% of these images for training, 15% for
    validation, and define the remaining 15% as test set to report the evaluation
    metrics. Additionally, we capture images from cultivated agricultural fields at
    various locations and deploy our proposed automatic procedure in Section III-B
    to compute sparse annotation for each image and generate the dataset D c which
    is captured with different RGB cameras and cover a variety of sugar beets. Furthermore,
    we gather images from uncultivated fields at different locations containing various
    weeds with varying growth stages. We perform our procedure proposed in Section
    III-C to automatically compute sparse annotations for each image and generate
    the dataset D w . Finally, we employ D s , D c , and D w to train a semantic segmentation
    network with our proposed method. TABLE I Dataset Information Additionally, we
    collected datasets from fields in Zurich and Stuttgart as target domains. Both
    contain sugar beets and weeds at various growth stages and differ visually substantially,
    see Fig. 6. As previously, we split each target domain into a training, validation,
    and testing split. Our method is not trained using any image in the target domains.
    Fig. 6. Sample images from source und target domains. Show All Evaluation Metric:
    To evaluate the performance of our approach and other methods, we compute the
    mean intersection over union (mIoU) ∈R[0,1] across the classes soil, weed, and
    crop based on the test set of each dataset, where higher values indicate a better
    performance [24]. A. Comparison to Conventional Semantic Segmentation To support
    our first key claim, we show that our approach achieves high generalization capabilities
    across different architectures compared to conventionally trained networks. First,
    we use the densely annotated dataset of Bonn and perform a conventional training,
    i.e., we pass images of the training set to the network and optimize the model
    parameters by minimizing the objective in (1). Subsequently, we deploy the trained
    model on the test sets of Bonn, Zurich, and Stuttgart. We denote this approach
    as “conventional”. In Tables II and III, we report the results based on DeepLabV3+
    and ERFNet, respectively. In Table II, we see that the mIoU of the conventionally
    trained model is high with 0.92 on the test set of Bonn but decreases substantially
    on the test sets of Zurich and Stuttgart with 0.47 and 0.62, respectively. We
    attribute this to the domain gap between the source and target domain. In Table
    III, we observe similar behavior when using ERFNet, indicating that the issue
    of low generalization capability is rather network-agnostic. TABLE II Comparison
    of mIoU on the Test Sets of Source and Target Domains Between Different Approaches
    Using DeepLabV3+ TABLE III Comparison of mIoU on the Test Sets of Source and Target
    Domains Between Different Approaches Using ERFNet Next, we train a model based
    on our proposed approach as described in Section III and deploy it to each test
    set. In Table II, we see that our method substantially increases the performance
    on the test sets of the target domains. Specifically, we achieve a mIoU of 0.79
    for Zurich and 0.78 for Stuttgart. These results indicate a better generalization
    capability of our method as it achieves a consistent performance on images of
    different agricultural fields captured by UAVs or UGVs with different GSDs. Simultaneously,
    the performance drop on test images of the source domain is small compared to
    the conventional method (0.92 vs. 0.90). Thus, our increased generalization performance
    does not come at the expense of a major performance decrease for the source domain.
    As before, we observe the same effect in Table III when using ERFNet to emphasize
    that our method is network-agnostic. Finally, we put the mIoU scores into a broader
    context and provide an upper bound for each dataset for comparison. To do that,
    we conventionally train three networks based on the training sets of Bonn, Zurich,
    and Stuttgart for each architecture. Then, we apply each model to its corresponding
    test set and report the performance, e.g., we deploy the model trained on the
    training set of Zurich to the test set of Zurich. In this setting, the domain
    gap between source and target domain is marginal and thus, the results can be
    seen as upper bounds, as shown in Table II and III. Accordingly, the average upper
    bound across all three datasets based on DeepLabV3+ is 0.91, see Table II. While
    the conventional approach achieves 0.67, we obtain 0.82 and thus substantially
    improve the generalization capabilities of CNNs, see Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Qualitative
    results based on DeepLabV3+ for the datasets Zurich and Stuttgart with different
    methods. Show All B. Comparison to Domain Adaptation The next experiments show
    that our approach outperforms commonly used domain adaptation methods. We use
    SCG [4] and CUT [11] to train networks on images of Bonn adapted to Zurich or
    Stuttgart. We refer to the models trained on Bonn adapted to Zurich by B→Z or
    to Stuttgart by B→S . First, we compare with models where the source domain is
    adapted to Zurich. Note that the conventional approach based on ERFNet performs
    poorly on Zurich, i.e., mIoU of 0.48, see Table III. Contrary, the models trained
    on the adapted source domain substantially improve the performance, i.e., mIoU
    of 0.76 and 0.71 for CUT and SCG. However, our domain generalized model outperforms
    both and achieves a mIoU of 0.79. Thus, our method outperforms the domain adaptation
    methods even in their targeted domain. Additionally, we observe for CUT and SCG
    a noticeable performance decrease on the original source domain, i.e., Bonn. Particularly,
    both methods achieve a mIoU of 0.86 compared to 0.93 for the conventional approach.
    This effect is less pronounced for our method, i.e., we achieve a mIoU of 0.90.
    Furthermore, the performance of CUT and SCG drop substantially when applied to
    Stuttgart, i.e., mIoU of 0.54 and 0.44. In sum, the domain adapted models perform
    only well on the domain they are adapted to. Contrary, we perform consistent across
    unseen agricultural fields, i.e., mIoU of 0.78 and 0.79 for Stuttgart and Zurich.
    The results in Table II support these conclusions when using DeepLabV3+. Next,
    we compare with models trained on the source domain adapted to Stuttgart. While
    the conventional approach obtains in Table III a mIoU of 0.57 on Stuttgart, the
    performance increase for SCG and CUT is barely or not present, i.e., 0.59 and
    0.57. We analyze the domain adapted images visually and find that their appearance
    is unrealistic. We attribute this to the difference in GSD between images of Bonn
    and Stuttgart. Similarly, Gogoll et al. [4] perform the domain adaptation only
    between images with the same GSD. This limitation results in underwhelming performance.
    Contrary, our method leverages images under various conditions and extends the
    source domain by images with various GSDs and achieves an increased mIoU of 0.78
    for Stuttgart. C. Comparison to Domain Generalization In the last experiments,
    we show that our method achieves superior performance among different domain generalization
    methods to support our third key claim. Specifically, we compete with RobustNet
    [14] and AugMix [13]. Unlike our approach, these methods do not include real-world
    images outside the source domain during training but suggest procedures that eventually
    operate within the source domain. Note that the implementation of RobustNet is
    only available for DeepLabV3+ and thus, we only report its results in Table II.
    In Table II, we show that our approach achieves an average mIoU of 0.82 across
    all datasets while RobustNet and AugMix obtain scores of and 0.75 and 0.78. Both
    baselines perform worse on Stuttgart with mIoU scores of 0.68 and 0.67 while our
    method achieves 0.78. We attribute this performance decrease to the different
    GSDs in the source domain of Bonn and target domain of Stuttgart. During training,
    the baseline models are restricted by the source domain containing plants with
    a GSD of 1mm/px . Consequently, their performance suffers on images of Stuttgart
    with a substantially increased GSD of 0.33mm/px . On the contrary, our approach
    effectively exploits additional images of various agricultural fields captured
    with different GSDs and thus shows increased performance. These results highlight
    that training on a single source domain is insufficient to achieve high domain
    generalization capabilities even with strong data augmentations like AugMix since
    it does not cover a sufficient intra-class variety. Our method overcomes this
    limitation by including automatically computed sparse annotations from diverse
    fields. We observe similar behavior in Table III, indicating that our method is
    network-agnostic. D. Ablation Studies A key contribution of our approach is to
    leverage unlabeled images from various agricultural fields in a two-step framework
    to increase the generalization capability of CNNs. To demonstrate the contribution
    of each step, we train and evaluate three networks using DeepLabV3+. We train
    the first model based on the objectives L s dense , L c sparse , and L w sparse
    , i.e., it considers the sparse annotation but not the WCTA. Contrary, we train
    the second model based on L s dense , L sc dense , and L sw dense , i.e., it considers
    the WCTA but not the sparse annotations. The third model considers all objectives
    and thus exploits our framework entirely. In Table IV, we report the evaluation
    metrics for each network and state that the first two models achieve an average
    mIoU of 0.68 and 0.75 across all datasets, respectively. Thus, both achieve superior
    performance compared to the conventional approach in Table II, i.e., 0.67. Consequently,
    each proposed method increases the generalization capability. However, the combination
    of both achieves the best average mIoU of 0.82, see Table IV. TABLE IV Effect
    of Each Step in Our Proposed Framework to Train With Sparse Annotations (An.),
    WCTA, or Both in Terms of mIoU on the Test Sets of Source and Target Domains Using
    DeepLabV3+ Additionally, setting α in (10) to a constant value of zero slightly
    decreases the mIoU of the model only considering the WCTA from 0.75 to 0.74. If
    we only use L s dense together with L c sparse the average mIoU drops slightly
    to 0.67, whereas using only L w sparse together with L s dense results in a big
    performance decrease to 0.59 average mIoU. SECTION V. Conclusion In this letter,
    we present a novel approach to leverage unlabeled images captured from various
    agricultural fields to develop domain generalized CNNs that enables agricultural
    robots to perform a reliable semantic segmentation of the classes soil, crop,
    and weed in different fields. First, we present a method to compute sparse annotations
    for these images automatically. Second, we propose a style transfer that renders
    images of the source domain in the style of real-world images captured in diverse
    conditions. We exploit both during training to increase the generalization capability
    of CNNs. We implemented and evaluated our approach based on multiple networks
    architectures and datasets. The experimental evaluation and comparisons with state-of-the-art
    methods support all claims made in this paper. We believe that our method allows
    to leverage vast amounts of unlabeled data to develop models with high generalization
    capabilities. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

  description: The agricultural industry has undergone significant transformation
    owing to technological advancements, evolving into a data-centric and more intelligent
    sector. The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has particularly
    revolutionized various industries, including agriculture. This profound shift
    has disrupted conventional farming practices while concurrently presenting new
    opportunities and challenges. IoT systems have made substantial contributions
    across multiple domains and are now prompting farmers to embrace Smart Agricultural
    systems for improved crop yields. Smart Agriculture leverages data aggregated
    from sensors and modern electronic devices to provide farmers with comprehensive
    field monitoring capabilities. This innovative approach enables predictive weather
    forecasting, automated control of pump motors, and artificial lighting activation

    significant transformation owing to technological advancements, evolving into
    a data-centric and more intelligent sector. The rapid proliferation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies has particularly revolutionized various industries,
    including agriculture. This profound shift has disrupted conventional farming
    practices while concurrently presenting new opportunities and challenges. IoT
    systems have made substantial contributions across multiple domains and are now
    prompting farmers to embrace Smart Agricultural systems for improved crop yields.
    Smart Agriculture leverages data aggregated from sensors and modern electronic
    devices to provide farmers with comprehensive field monitoring capabilities. This
    innovative approach enables predictive weather forecasting, automated control

    IEEE Conference Location: CHENNAI, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION The agricultural
    sector accounts for 18% of India''s GDP and employs around 57% of the country''s
    rural population. For countless years, agriculture has been the primary source
    of income. Seventy percent of India''s GDP and eighty percent of India''s labor
    force were involved in agriculture at the time of independence [1]. It is timely
    to link the agricultural landscape with wireless technology in order to introduce
    and accommodate digital communication with farmers as the globe is on the cusp
    of a digital revolution [2]. A society''s most basic need is to be certain of
    its ability to meet its basic nutritional needs. Policymakers and agricultural
    experts were alarmed by the declining food grain supplies [3]. However, the agricultural
    sector as a whole places high demands on technology solutions for long-term sustainability
    with little environmental effect [4], [5]. Through wireless communication and
    sensor technologies, farmers can learn what their crops need even when they can''t
    physically be there. With the use of sensors (for light, humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, etc.), the irrigation system may be automated via Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based \"smart farming.\" The farmers may check up on the fields no matter
    where they are. Smart farming that relies on the Internet of Things is far more
    productive than traditional farming [6], [7]. Fig. 1 Agriculture through IoT Show
    All The term \"sustainable agriculture\" refers to the durability and longevity
    of ecologically grown cereals [8]. Our proposed system represents a significant
    leap in the realm of farming condition monitoring, harnessing the potential of
    a diverse array of sensors to provide farmers with a holistic view of their agricultural
    environments [9]. The core objective of our system is to empower farmers with
    data-driven insights and real-time monitoring capabilities that enhance crop health,
    optimize resource utilization, and mitigate potential threats. Soil moisture sensors
    are integral to our system, enabling farmers to monitor and manage irrigation
    practices efficiently. These sensors detect moisture levels in the soil, ensuring
    that crops receive the appropriate amount of water. Over-irrigation and under-irrigation
    are common issues in agriculture, and these sensors help prevent both, promoting
    healthier and more productive crops. Light intensity sensors, known as Light Dependent
    Resistors (LDRs), are used to gauge the intensity of natural light in the farming
    environment [10]. When light levels fall below a certain threshold, the LDRs trigger
    the activation of artificial lighting systems, ensuring that crops receive adequate
    illumination for photosynthesis and growth. This automated response to changing
    light conditions enhances crop productivity. SECTION II. RELATED STUDY Farming
    is the backbone of agriculture, which contributes significantly to a country''s
    GDP. The problems with conventional outdoor farming have led many to seek indoor
    farming as a better long-term solution [11]. When it comes to getting things done
    in today''s high-tech world, the IoT has tremendous promise. Sensors and other
    tools are included in the category of \"Internet of Things\" devices. A machine
    of this type has vast potential in many different industries, including agriculture,
    research, and the military. The methodology provided in [12] looks at how IoT
    may help the farming sector. The IoT has several potential applications, including
    improving farm safety, streamlining the distribution and retail of food and other
    agricultural products, and many others. In order to create intelligent agricultural
    land, the suggested model considers the usage of drones, autonomous tractors,
    and defense systems, all of which will be discussed in further depth below. Good
    operation and several uses for these devices are possible with proper AI monitoring
    and management. By equipping their aerial machine, ground machine, and defense
    mechanism with the proper sensors, farmers may relax after a hard day''s work
    in the fields [13]. To maintain ideal growing conditions, several wireless sensors
    have been integrated into agricultural environment monitoring systems. IoT sensors
    send data from farms via wireless sensors. Improve crop yields by more accurate
    field analysis using a machine-learning-based monitoring system. Several incorrect
    analyses of the data failed to foretell the results. In [14] an IoT-based Smart
    agricultural monitoring solution that makes use of Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    to address this issue. With the help of this suggested system, farmers and users
    will have access to real-time data over the internet. It''s a novel approach to
    integrating IoT with swarms of remote sensors to create a smart remote monitoring
    system for farms. Sensor nodes are strategically placed around the battlefield
    to track many moving targets. After being shown on the transmitter, these values
    are transmitted from the base station through the XBee sensor. Structure and data
    set generation for sensor value screening. It has applications in ecological study
    and analysis. When compared to the alternative system, the performance of the
    suggested system is superior. Indian farmers need more education and resources
    to deal with the mounting challenges posed by globalization, unchecked FDI, and
    multinational corporations. Therefore, it is urgent that we implement new reforms
    in agricultural education, prioritize the transfer of technology, and invest heavily
    in trans-disciplinary scientific and practical research [15]. SECTION III. METHODOLOGY
    Our proposed system focuses on comprehensive farming condition monitoring utilizing
    various sensors, including those for humidity, temperature, Siemens Stirans Acoustic
    sensors, soil moisture, light intensity (LDR), and infrared (IR) for pest, bird,
    and human detection based on body temperature. This system operates in conjunction
    with an Arduino-UNO module as its processing unit. An LCD display is employed
    to provide real-time status updates from the different sensors. For temperature
    regulation, the system is designed to respond to temperature fluctuations. When
    a change in temperature is detected, the sensor activates a DC cooling fan to
    lower the temperature. Once the temperature returns to a normal range, the DC
    fan is automatically deactivated. A soil moisture sensor plays a crucial role
    in monitoring soil moisture levels. When the soil becomes excessively dry due
    to low water levels, the sensor detects this condition and initiates the operation
    of a DC water pump to irrigate the ground. This system offers a comprehensive
    and responsive solution for monitoring and managing farming conditions efficiently.
    Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the proposed model. Fig. 2 Block Diagram of
    the Proposed Model Show All A. Arduino-Uno Microcontroller Board The Arduino Uno
    shown in Figure 3, represents an open-source microcontroller board centered on
    the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino. Additionally,
    it features a USB connection, a power jack, a 16MHz quartz crystal, an ICSP (In-Circuit
    Serial Programming) header, and a reset button. The Arduino Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE) is a versatile application compatible with Windows, Mac, OS,
    and Linux, written in the Java programming language. This IDE facilitates the
    writing and uploading of programs to the Arduino board. Sensors play a crucial
    role in this system by converting input data into output voltage changes, thereby
    triggering detection and enabling various functionalities. Fig. 3 Arduino-Uno
    Microcontroller Board Show All B. Siemens Stirans Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors
    shown in Figure 4, have found diverse applications in agriculture and pest monitoring,
    contributing significantly to various essential tasks in the farming industry.
    These sensors operate on the principle of detecting sound waves or vibrations
    in the environment, offering valuable insights and data for agricultural purposes.
    In the realm of pest monitoring and detection, acoustic sensors play a pivotal
    role. Pests often generate specific acoustic signals when they interact with plants
    or move through crop fields. These sensors are adept at capturing these signals,
    aiding farmers in the timely identification of pest infestations. Early detection
    facilitates precise interventions, reducing the reliance on broad-spectrum pesticides
    and minimizing the environmental impact of pest control. Fig. 4 Siemens Stirans
    Acoustic Sensors Show All Another valuable application is in the classification
    of seed varieties. Acoustic sensors can distinguish between different seed types
    based on their unique acoustic properties. Seeds produce distinct acoustic signatures
    when subjected to vibrations or shaking. By analyzing these signatures, farmers
    and seed producers can efficiently sort and classify seeds, ensuring uniformity
    and quality in planting, which is essential for crop consistency. In summary,
    acoustic sensors have emerged as versatile tools in modern agriculture, revolutionizing
    precision farming practices and sustainability efforts. They empower farmers to
    monitor environmental conditions, detect pest threats, and evaluate crop health
    more effectively. Furthermore, they facilitate the efficient management of agricultural
    resources, ultimately leading to increased yields and reduced environmental footprints
    in the farming industry. C. FC-28 Soil Hygrometer Sensor Fig. 5 Soil Hygrometer

    moisture sensor designed for soil moisture detection. Figure 5 shows the soil
    hygrometer sensor. The sensor operates by producing a high-level output when the
    soil is adequately moist and a low-level output when moisture is insufficient.
    This functionality is particularly useful for creating automated watering systems,
    relieving the need for constant human intervention in garden plant care. The sensor
    offers adjustable sensitivity, allowing users to fine-tune its performance with
    a blue digital potentiometer adjustment. It operates within a voltage range of
    3.3V to 5V, providing flexibility in its power supply. The module provides dual

    ensuring exceptional long-term stability and a high level of reliability. The
    sensor comprises a capacitive wetting element and a highly precise temperature
    measuring element, seamlessly integrated with a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller.
    E. LM393 Photosensitive light Sensor The LDR Sensor Module shown in Figure 7,
    serves the purpose of detecting the presence of light and measuring its intensity.
    When exposed to light, the module''s output signal goes high, and it transitions
    to a low state when light is absent. This sensitivity to light can be finely adjusted
    using a potentiometer, allowing for precise customization. Fig. 7 Photosensitive
    light Sensor Show All Key Features of the LDR Sensor Module include the use of
    the LM393 comparator chip, ensuring stability in its performance. It excels at
    detecting ambient brightness and light intensity and offers adjustable sensitivity
    through a blue digital potentiometer adjustment. The module provides dual output
    options: a digital switch output (0 and 1) and an analog voltage output. With
    a fixed bolt hole, installation is straightforward and secure. The module is equipped
    with power and digital switch output indicators in red and green, respectively,
    enhancing user feedback and visibility. Additionally, it includes a mounting hole
    screw, simplifying the installation process. The LDR module operates within a
    voltage range of 3.3V to 5V. The package includes one LM393 Photosensitive LDR
    Sensor Module, offering a comprehensive solution for light detection and intensity
    measurement needs. F. AirFlowSensor 5101 The SL5101 calorimetric sensor is designed
    to accurately detect air flow within a range of 1 to 10 m/s, either below or above
    a predefined threshold. Its output mechanism comprises a normally-open relay contact
    that activates when the air flow surpasses the configured level. The sensor operates
    efficiently with a 24VDC power supply, requiring just 1VA of power. Key Features
    of the SL5101 Calorimetric Sensor include its ability to actuate a relay switch
    in response to changes in air flow, making it a valuable component for applications
    like ventilation run detection and HVAC system monitoring. With a body length
    of 140 mm and a diameter of 23 mm, it offers compact dimensions suitable for various
    installations. Additionally, its versatile usage extends to wind detection, making
    it a versatile solution for a range of air flow sensing needs. SECTION IV RESULTS
    AND DISCUSSIONS The process of implementing our system begins with the development
    of code using the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Once the code
    is ready, it is uploaded to the Arduino board, initiating the initialization sequence.
    Concurrently, we establish physical connections between various components, including
    sensors, a Wi-Fi module, relay switch, bulb, water pump, and DC fan, all linked
    to the Arduino board. Simultaneously, we connect the Arduino board to the IDE
    via a data cable, which serves the dual purpose of supplying the required voltage
    to operate the hardware and facilitating the monitoring of serial output. Figure
    8 shows the proposed system. Fig. 8 Proposed System Show All As the data is successfully
    uploaded to the Arduino hardware and communication is established with the Arduino
    IDE, the project commences its operation. Based on the behavior of the sensors,
    the Arduino board starts executing its programmed instructions. The operational
    status of these sensors is visually displayed on an LCD screen, providing real-time
    information about the farming conditions being monitored. Additionally, the Arduino
    board transmits this data through the Wi-Fi module to a remote server, enabling
    users to access and monitor the system''s performance through a mobile phone.
    This seamless integration of hardware and software facilitates efficient and remote
    management of the farming environment, ensuring optimal conditions and timely
    responses to sensor inputs. Energy Consumption Table 1 and Figure 9 provides an
    extensive and detailed comparison of energy requirements across a spectrum of
    wireless technologies, with a specific emphasis on two vital components: Monitoring
    Nodes and Relay Nodes. The energy consumption data is precisely measured in units
    of milliwatts (mW). Within the domain of WiFi technology, it''s observed that
    the Monitoring Node necessitates a substantial 420 mW of power to operate effectively,
    while the Relay Node demonstrates a notable advantage in terms of energy efficiency,
    with a lower power requirement of 270 mW. Turning our attention to Bluetooth technology,
    we find that the Monitoring Node consumes 350 mW of power, while the Relay Node
    exhibits a slightly reduced power consumption of 250 mW. TABLE 1. COMPARING THE
    ENERGY NEEDS OF VARIOUS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES Fig. 9 Monitoring vs Relay Nodes
    for Wireless Technologies Show All TABLE 2. OUTPUT VALUES FROM VARIOUS SENSORS
    Fig. 10 Temperature, Humidity and Noise Comparison Over Time Show All Fig. 11
    Air Flow Comparison Over Time Show All Table 2 and Figures 10 and 11 shows the
    output values from various sensors. Maintaining optimal humidity and temperature
    levels is critical for crop growth and disease prevention. Light intensity sensors
    (LDR) are used to assess the amount of sunlight reaching the crops. Monitoring
    light levels helps ensure that crops receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis.
    If light levels fall below the required threshold, the system can automatically
    turn on artificial lighting to supplement natural sunlight, promoting consistent
    and healthy plant growth. Infrared (IR) sensors have multifaceted applications
    in farming condition monitoring. They can detect variations in body temperature,
    making them effective tools for pest, bird, and human detection. IR sensors can
    identify warm-blooded intruders in the farming area and trigger alarms or responses
    to deter them. In summary, comprehensive farming condition monitoring harnesses
    the power of diverse sensors to create a holistic view of the farming environment.
    This integrated approach allows farmers to proactively manage factors like humidity,
    temperature, pests, and human activity, resulting in improved crop yields, reduced
    resource waste, and enhanced overall farm productivity. The real-time data provided
    by these sensors empowers farmers to make timely and informed decisions, ultimately
    contributing to sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. SECTION V CONCLUSION
    AND FUTURE SCOPE The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into agricultural
    practices heralds a transformative era for the farming industry, offering a multitude
    of benefits aimed at boosting crop yield and enhancing agricultural efficiency.
    In this IoT-driven platform, we harness cutting-edge technology to monitor and
    manage critical aspects of farming operations. One of the key advantages of our
    IoT platform is its capacity to provide real-time insights into weather conditions,
    particularly humidity and temperature. By continuously monitoring these parameters,
    farmers gain an unprecedented level of control over their agricultural environments.
    This data informs decision-making processes, enabling timely responses to changing
    weather patterns and conditions, ultimately leading to improved crop health and
    yield. One of the most compelling advantages of this IoT-based system is its ability
    to reduce the impact of weather-related challenges on farming. By allowing remote
    monitoring and control through mobile devices and computers, farmers can oversee
    their operations regardless of their physical location. This remote accessibility
    enables proactive measures in response to changing conditions, ensuring that crops
    are well-cared for and optimized for growth. In conclusion, our IoT-enabled platform
    is poised to revolutionize agriculture by delivering excellent crop yields and
    superior output results. It offers a multifaceted approach to crop management,
    including weather monitoring, soil moisture control, and pest detection, all of
    which contribute to increased agricultural productivity. Moreover, by streamlining
    farming operations and reducing the dependency on manual labor, this system is
    a powerful tool for modernizing and enhancing agricultural production in India
    and beyond. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This IoT Farm:

  description: Precision agriculture includes the optimum and adequate use of resources
    depending on several variables that govern crop yield. Precision agriculture offers
    a novel solution utilizing a systematic technique for current agricultural problems
    like balancing production and environmental concerns. Weed control has become
    one of the significant problems in the agricultural sector. In traditional weed
    control, the entire field is treated uniformly by spraying the soil, a single
    herbicide dose, weed, and crops in the same way. For more precise farming, robots
    could accomplish targeted weed treatment if they could specifically find the location
    of the dispensable plant and identify the weed type. This may lessen by large
    margin utilization of agrochemicals on agricultural fields and favour sustainable
    agriculture. This study presents a Harris Hawks Optimizer with Graph Convolutional
    Network based Weed Detection (HHOGCN-WD) technique for Precision Agriculture.
    The HHOGCN-WD technique mainly focuses on identifying and classifying weeds for
    precision agriculture. For image pre-processing, the HHOGCN-WD model utilizes
    a bilateral normal filter (BNF) for noise removal. In addition, coupled convolutional
    neural network (CCNet) model is utilized to derive a set of feature vectors. To
    detect and classify weed, the GCN model is utilized with the HHO algorithm as
    a hyperparameter optimizer to improve the detection performance. The experimental
    results of the HHOGCN-WD technique are investigated under the benchmark dataset.
    The results indicate the promising performance of the presented HHOGCN-WD model
    over other recent approaches, with increased accuracy of 99.13%.

    Chapter © 2023 Introduction Agricultural workers in Indian farms remove weeds
    by spraying herbicides manually. Directly exposing farmers to weedicide can cause
    a range of health complications such as cancer, reproductive disorders, dermatitis,
    wheezing, coughing and other respiratory problems. Moreover, the presence of chemicals
    in the food has become a major concern today. Ingestion of even traces of these
    chemicals can cause a plethora of diseases among the consumers. The information
    about the pesticides and their usage is given that carcinogenic potential, endocrine/hormone-disrupting
    and immune toxic effect are 56, 81, 38, respectively (Kumar and Reddy 2017). It
    is very miserable to note that in India, even the breast milk and blood samples
    are polluted with pesticides from the environment and biological system. The various
    levels of pesticides present as 12.5% of unapproved pesticides, 18.7% samples
    of pesticide residues, 2.6% of samples are noted which has residues above the
    maximum residue level (MRL) recommended by FSSAI. The samples include tea, milk,
    fish, egg, spices, meat, cereals, pulses and vegetables and collected during 2014–15.
    There were also samples noted with multiple pesticides. This has resulted in the
    trend of organic foods taking over the world. The high cost of pure organic weedicide
    and low yield that results from organic farming has led to a drastic increase
    in the prices of organic food. Moreover, weedicide can contaminate soil, water
    and other organisms (Aktar et al. 2009). In addition to killing weeds, weedicide
    can be toxic to a host of other organisms including birds, fish, beneficial insects
    and non-target plants. Heavy treatment of soil with synthetic weedicide can cause
    populations of beneficial soil microorganisms to decline. According to the soil
    scientist’s, loss of both bacteria and fungi degrades the soil. Indiscriminate
    use of chemicals might work for a few years, but after a while, the beneficial
    soil organisms become non-existent to hold onto the nutrients, making the soil
    infertile. Thus, the efficient way of cultivating food that benefits both producers
    and consumers while preserving the environment would be a method that goes midway
    in the development of sustainable agricultural growth. The robotic system that
    can efficiently differentiate between a weed and a crop plant can be deployed
    on the field, which eliminates the human engagement in the delivery of chemicals.
    As precision agriculture is adopted, the amount of chemicals used on the crop
    is heavily reduced and thereby making it healthier and cheaper for the consumers.
    This work intends to propose an intelligent solution to identify the non-crop
    vegetation using combination of image feature extraction methods with machine
    learning algorithms, on the images captured by a camera mounted on a semi-automated
    robot. The solution includes the analysis of how two feature extraction techniques,
    namely speeded-up robust features (SURF) and histogram of gradients (HOG) and
    two classification algorithms, namely logistic regression and support vector machine
    (SVM), affect the accuracy and efficiency of weed detection system (WDS). Existing
    systems Using shape of leaves and their veins for classification, a method is
    used to distinguish between crop and weed leaves in real-time corn field using
    fast Fourier transform, produced the accuracy of 92% in detecting weed plants
    (Nejati et al. 2008). It is semi-automatic and gives good results for big leaves
    only. Astrand and Baerveldt (2005) developed to remove the weed from the field
    using selective rotary hoe and a machine which has computer vision guidance. This
    robotic control weed detection machine works well when weed is less and crops
    are more in the field. Another system proposed by Tannouche et al. (2015) is an
    automated robot that uses artificial neural network (ANN) for the detection and
    classification of the weed leaves from that of the onion plants. However, the
    model has multiple disadvantages, and this model uses the classification on the
    type of weed instead of the crop plant. Guyer et al. (1993) used the curvature,
    area and perimeter of the leaf to identify the leaf edge patterns. They used the
    technique of combining and structuring the basic, explicit information into subjective
    shape knowledge. Thus, it combines the rule-based data with low-level quantitative
    feature, transformed into high-level quantitative feature. The small-sized low-cost
    interactive robots are used (Arif and Butt 2014) which helps in precision farming.
    The robot navigates through row technique. The digital image processing techniques
    are used in the computer vision robot which distinguishes crop from weed. They
    use Hough transformation and greyscale conversion for identification. There are
    other approaches in the literature such as shape analysis, colour analysis and
    texture analysis (Chaisattapagon (1995). Various colour filters can be used on
    black and white images during pre-processing stages. The different features such
    as morphology, spectral property, visual texture and spatial context are considered
    in various works. Herrera et al. (2014) discussed about the number of boundary
    pixels in the segmented part of the image. The region-based shape indexed factor
    method was developed by Bakhshipour et al. (2018). The average of the third component
    in YIQ colour space spectral features is discussed by Sabzi et al. (2018). Campos
    et al. (2017) used the statistical visual texture features such as the autocorrelation
    of the degree of similarity of the elements in an image. Dynamic programming technique
    which uses the previous knowledge of the geometric structure for crop row detection
    was developed by García-Santillán et al. (2018, 2017) and Vidović et al. (2016).
    The detection, identification and guidance techniques used in general purpose
    robotic system to control weeds are reviewed (Slaughter et al. 2008). Next evolution,
    a more robust identification technique which handles the occlusion problem in
    differentiating between weed and crop was developed (Tian et al. 2000 and Lee
    et al. 1999). Hague et al. (2000) used different types of sensors, machine vision,
    accelerometers odometers and compass for the navigation of the robot in the farm
    field. An algorithm of shape analysis was developed by Perez et al. (2000) for
    differentiating crop and weed. Liu and Chal (2018) have developed a system to
    detect common invertebrate pests in farmland using a multi-spectral mechanism.
    Though the precision score of this system is good, still there is scope of optimizing
    the robot system. Sabzi et al. (2018) identified three different types of weeds
    in the potato field using heuristic algorithm. Initially, feature selection is
    done using the cultural algorithm, and five most important features are selected.
    Then, the optimal configuration of the network is found using the harmony search
    algorithm. The limitation is that when the field density is high, the system cannot
    identify the weed. Zhai et al (2018) used particle swarm optimization techniques
    for precise spraying of pesticide. Chang et al. (2018) developed a small-scale
    robot machine which uses multitasking and computer vision that identifies weed
    and also performs variable rate irrigation techniques to increase productivity.
    Image processing techniques such as morphology operator, binary segmentation,
    HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) conversion are used. It can classify weed and
    plant and also irrigate the land using fuzzy logic controller. Weed detection
    part needs to be improved. Jiang et al (2020) used convolutional neural network
    is used to identify weed, and further it has to be updated for wide range of soil,
    location and image acquisition heights. The existing methods considered only the
    biological morphology, spectral features, visual textures and spatial contexts
    features and do not consider the generic features of the images. Also not much
    of the system considered the blur and rotated images. The proposed solution in
    this paper looks to adopt feature extraction techniques such as HOG and SURF which
    considers the generic feature for a more generalized approach. It also captures
    the edge and corner features which has more information through the HOG technique.
    This work aims to solve the problems stated and discussed in the literature survey
    by proposing a solution that is robust to leaves of different size shapes and
    colours using machine learning aalgorithms such as logistic regression and SVM
    for classification. Moreover, the usage of the two different datasets including
    a custom captured dataset is an attempt to arrive at a best methodology that can
    be adopted for any exiguous crop weed combination dataset. Materials and methods
    The main idea behind the project is to achieve real-time weed detection in fields
    using a robot through a binary classification of the images captured through the
    camera, i.e. the WDS. Initially, the image captured is subject to image pre-processing.
    This is necessary as images should not contain unwanted information which could
    lead to the poor performance of the model. Feature extraction techniques are used
    to acquire the important features from the image which are then fed to the trained
    model. Two datasets are used. CWFID is used to compare with the existing works
    since it is the benchmarking dataset. To test our model, custom dataset is generated
    by WDS field robot. The weedicide is sprayed if it is not a plant, otherwise,
    it moves forward. Figure 1 describes the architecture of the WDS. Fig. 1 Architecture
    diagram of WDS Full size image For training the model, testing is done. For evaluating
    the testing of the model, the various performance metrics used are precision,
    recall, F1 score and accuracy. The model is tested for several runs, recorded
    the results and then evaluated the performance score of each factor. Precision
    Precision is the ratio of number of true positives (TP) or relevant instances
    to the sum of TP and false positives (FP) or retrieved instances. It is used to
    find how much samples are wrongly identified as positive instead of negative.
    Its formula is given by: $$\\mathrm{Precision}=\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FP}}$$
    (1) Recall Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives
    and false negatives (FN). The recall is subliminally the ability of the classifier
    to find all the positive samples which in turn tells how many of the true positives
    were actually recalled. Its formula is given by: $$\\mathrm{Recall}=\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FN}}$$
    (2) F1-score F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of precision
    and recall, where an F-beta score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score
    of 0. $$\\mathrm{F}1\\mathrm{ Score}=\\frac{2\\times \\mathrm{Recall}\\times \\mathrm{Precision}}{\\mathrm{Precision}+\\mathrm{Recall}}$$
    (3) Accuracy Accuracy is an important metric for evaluating classification models.
    Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions the model correctly identified.
    For binary classification, accuracy can also be calculated in terms of positives
    and negatives as follows: $$\\mathrm{Accuracy}=\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{TN}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{TN}+\\mathrm{FP}+\\mathrm{FN}}$$
    (4) Dataset acquisition Crop/weed field image dataset (CWFID) The CWFID, a dataset
    widely used in applications for precision agriculture based on computer vision,
    especially weed control (Swapnali and Vijay 2014), was used for the project. Sample
    images consisting of both the crop and weed are shown in Fig. 2. It consisted
    of 60 images with annotations. For every image in the dataset, a ground truth
    segmentation mask to separate the vegetation from the background and a manual
    annotation of the type of plant (Crop vs. Weed) was available in the dataset.
    Fig. 2 Sample images from CWFID dataset Full size image Custom dataset A custom
    labelled dataset in which images were captured using the Raspberry Pi 3 camera
    module night vision camera from a height of 45 cm was created for this study.
    Amaranthus dubius was taken as the crop, and dwarf copperleaf was taken as the
    weed specimen. The dataset consisted of 300 images, 150 images of crops and weeds
    each. Sample images consisting of crop and weed are depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3
    Sample images from custom dataset (a) plant (b) weed Full size image Dataset enhancement
    Given below are the pre-processing techniques adopted for the two datasets, i.e.
    custom generated and CWFID dataset, respectively. CWFID dataset Every image in
    the dataset had a combination of both the crop and the weed and separately, masks
    were provided for the crops and weeds as shown in Fig. 4. As a part of the pre-processing
    step, the masks were applied onto each image in the dataset to obtain two images,
    one of the crops and the other of weed. Thus, the 60-image dataset described in
    “Crop/weed field image dataset (CWFID)” section was used to populate 120 images
    consisting of 60 crops images and 60 weed images. Fig. 4 Applying masks on CWFID
    (a) annotation of plant (green) and weed (red-CWFID (b) masked image of plant—CWFID(c)
    masked image of weed CWFID Full size image Custom dataset The custom-generated
    300-image dataset as described in “Custom dataset” section consists of 150 colour
    (RGB) images of each crop and weed. And to facilitate effective separation of
    the plant parts from the background, a technique called excess green is adopted,
    which enhances the green scale in the image. Further background segmentation was
    executed using thresholding. 1. Excess green thresholding was applied on the image
    to introduce effective contrast between the foreground (plant) and the background
    (soil), by enhancing the greenness of the image. R(red) = image [:,:,0], G(green) = image
    [:,:,1], B(blue) = image [:,:,2] 2*G-R-B is the excess green function used. 2.
    Background segmentation was executed using thresholding. The technique of thresholding
    involves a comparison of each pixel value of the image (pixel intensity) to a
    specified threshold calibrated. This splits all the pixels of the input image
    into two segments: i. Pixels that contain lower intensity values than the calibrated
    threshold. ii. Pixels that contain greater intensity values than the calibrated
    threshold. These two segments are now given different values; to segment the background
    from the foreground here the background was given 0 (black) and the foreground
    1 (white) as shown in Fig. 5. The threshold value used to segment this dataset
    was “80”. Fig. 5 Images at different stages of dataset pre-processing (a) image
    before enhancement (b) after enhancement using excess green thresholding (c) background
    segmented image Full size image Feature extraction Speeded-up robust features
    After pre-processing, the SURF method (Bay and Tuytelaars 2006) was used to extract
    features from the image. SURF is a method to extract interesting points of an
    image and create descriptors. This method is widely used for its powerful attributes,
    which include lighting and contrast invariance, scale and translation invariance,
    rotation invariance. It detects objects from images captured under a variety of
    intrinsic and extrinsic settings. The algorithm comprises of the following four
    steps: i. Integral image generation ii. Interest point detection (Fast-Hessian
    detector) iii. Descriptor orientation assignment (optional) iv. Descriptor generation
    All the ensuing parts of the algorithm use integral image resulting in a significant
    acceleration in their speed. Equation (4) shows an integral image. While using
    an integral image, only four-pixel values are read from the original image to
    calculate the surface integral of any size. $$ I\\left( {x,y} \\right) = \\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 0}^{n} \\sum I\\left( {i,j} \\right) $$ (5) while calculating
    the responses of Haar and Gaussian wavelet filter, this fact is generally used.
    $$ H\\left( {x,y} \\right) = \\det \\left( {_{{\\frac{{\\partial^{2} f}}{\\partial
    x\\partial y}\\frac{{\\partial^{2} f}}{{\\partial y^{2} }}}}^{{\\frac{{\\partial^{2}
    f}}{{\\partial x^{2} }}\\frac{{\\partial^{2} f}}{\\partial x\\partial y}}} } \\right)
    $$ (6) $$ H\\left( {\\overline{x}} \\right) = D_{xx} \\left( {\\overline{x}} \\right)D_{yy}
    \\left( {\\overline{x}} \\right) - \\left( {0.9D_{xy} \\left( {\\overline{x}}
    \\right)} \\right)2 $$ (7) $$ \\overline{x} = \\left( {x,y,s} \\right) $$ (8)
    while calculating the responses of Haar and Gaussian wavelet filter, this fact
    is generally used. The SURF method, using the determinants of Hessian matrices,
    locates the significant points on the images. Equation (8) depicts the original
    definition for this determinant of general two-dimensional function. Two significant
    methods using the Fast-Hessian detector are used to modify this equation: 1. Replacing
    second-order partial derivatives by convolutions of an image with approximations
    of the Gaussian kernels second-order derivatives. Coefficient 0:9 in Eq. (7) compensates
    for this approximation. 2. Both positions in the image and size are used to parameterize
    the Gaussian kernels. $$H(x)=H+\\frac{{\\partial H}^{{\\varvec{T}}}}{\\partial
    \\mathrm{x}}x+\\frac{1}{2}{x}^{T}\\frac{{\\partial }^{2}\\mathrm{H}}{{\\partial
    \\mathrm{x}}^{2}}x$$ (9) $$\\widehat{x}=\\frac{{\\partial }^{2}{\\mathrm{H}}^{-1}}{{\\partial
    \\mathrm{x}}^{2}}x\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$$ (10) The parameter s in Eq.
    (8) is scaling, which represents the scale space. In SURF algorithm, the representative
    points are assigned with dynamic weights. The weight of every representative point
    can be calculated using the following equation: $${\\mathrm{W}}_{\\mathrm{P}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{No}.\\mathrm{of
    detected images w}.\\mathrm{r}.\\mathrm{t Point p}}{\\mathrm{No}.\\mathrm{of training
    images in object}}$$ (11) Clustering SURF features The number of SURF features
    obtained from each image is vast. Instead of using all the SURF features for training,
    similar SURF features were grouped using K-means clustering (Sammut and Webb 2017),
    and samples are depicted in Fig. 6. The number of clusters was decided using the
    Elbow method (Syakur et al. 2018) and 300 was the resulting number of clusters.
    The whole dataset was split into train and test data in 80–20 ratio, respectively.
    For each image, a training instance was computed which a collection of 300 attributes,
    each was corresponding to the frequency of occurrence of the respective cluster
    number. Hence, the training and test datasets were prepared. Fig. 6 SURF features
    extracted from each class of the two datasets (a) CWFID—weed (b) CWFID—plant (c)
    Custom dataset—weed (d) Custom dataset—plant Full size image Histogram of gradients
    The essential idea behind the HOG descriptors is that the distribution of intensity
    gradients or edge directions describes shape and the local object appearance within
    an image. HOG descriptors are formed by combining local histograms for the cells
    (localized portions) of an image. These histograms represent information of gradient
    directions or edge orientations for the pixels in the cells. To make the histograms
    invariant to light, every histogram of the cells is contrast normalized. To summarize,
    histogram calculation involves: 1. Calculation of gradients 2. Generation of histograms
    3. Normalization of histogram Calculation of gradients To begin with feature extraction
    through HOG, the first step is to find first-order differential coefficients,
    Gx(i,j) and Gy(i,j), is computed by the following equations: $${G}_{x}(i,j)=f(i+1,j)-f(i-1,j)$$
    (12) $${G}_{y}(i,j)=f(i,j+1)-f(i,j-1)$$ (13) where f (i,j) means intensity at
    (i, j). Then, magnitude, m, and orientation, θ, of the gradients are computed
    with the following formulae, respectively. $$m(i,j)=\\sqrt{{G}_{x}(i,j{)}^{2}+{\\mathrm{G}}_{y}(i,j{)}^{2}}$$
    (14) $$\\uptheta (i,j)=\\mathrm{arctan}(\\frac{{G}_{x}(i,j)}{{G}_{y}(i,j)})$$
    (15) Generation of histograms After computing values of magnitude (m) and orientation
    (θ), histograms are generated as follows: 1. Identify the bin θ (i, j) 2. Increment
    the value in bin determined in step 1 3. Similarly, the above steps are repeated
    for all gradients in the cell To decrease the effect of aliasing, the values in
    the two neighbouring bins are increased. After incrementing, n indicates the bin
    number to which orientation value, θ (i, j) belongs to, and n + 1 is the neighbouring
    bin. The values of m n and m n+1 are calculated as below: $$n=floor(\\frac{b\\uptheta
    (\\mathrm{i},\\mathrm{j}) }{\\pi })$$ (16) $${m}_{n}=(1-\\alpha )m(i,j)$$ (17)
    $${m}_{n+1}=\\alpha m(i,j)$$ (18) where b represents the total number of bins,
    α is a parameter for proportional distribution of magnitude m (i, j) which is
    defined as the distance from θ (i, j) to class n and n + 1, $$\\alpha =\\frac{b}{\\pi
    }(\\uptheta (\\mathrm{i},\\mathrm{j})\\mathrm{ mod}\\frac{\\pi }{b})$$ (19) Histogram
    normalization The final step is combining all the local histograms of the cells
    in a block to form the final histogram. To make the features invariant to illumination
    and contrast, L1-norm is adopted. After obtaining the large combined histogram,
    it is normalized: $$ v = \\frac{{V_{k} }}{{\\left| {\\left| {V_{k} } \\right|}
    \\right| + \\varepsilon }} $$ (20) Here, Vk represents the combined histogram
    for the block, ε is a small constant, and v is the final HOG feature vector. In
    Fig. 7, it is observed that the HOG features extracted from each of the crop and
    the weed in both the considered datasets. Fig. 7 HOG features extracted from each
    class of the two datasets (a) Custom Dataset—plant (b) Custom Dataset—weed (c)
    CWFID—Plant (d) CWFID—weed Full size image Training a binary classification model
    Logistic regression Logistic regression (Kleinbaum et al. 2002) was used as the
    model to classify the images into crop and weed. In logistic regression, the probability
    of having the outcome as positive case is generally defined in the response variable.
    If the response variable is found to be equal to or greater than a discrimination
    threshold, the positive class is predicted; otherwise, the negative class is predicted.
    The logistic function as given below always returns a value between zero and one:
    $$F(t)=\\frac{1}{1+{{\\varvec{e}}}^{-t}}$$ (21) The training set consisting of
    300-length vectors representing the cluster frequencies was trained using the
    logistic regression model with inverse regularization parameter of 0.001 and a
    penalty l2. Support vector machine A support vector machine (Pisner et al. 2020)
    can be used for regression, classification or other tasks. In a high- or infinite-dimensional
    space, it primarily constructs a hyper-plane or set of hyper-planes. The hyper-planes
    help to find a good separation between the different classes based on the largest
    distance of the hyper-lane to the closest training data point of the classes (also
    called as functional margin). Thus, if the margin is larger, then the generalization
    error of the classifier is lesser. Suppose there are training vectors, \\(x_{i}
    \\in R^{p}\\), i = 1,.. n, in two classes, and a vector \\(y \\in \\left\\{ {1,
    - 1} \\right\\}^{n}\\), SVC solves the following primal problem: $$\\min_{{\\omega
    ,b,c\\frac{1}{2}\\omega T\\omega }} + C\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {C_{i} ,}\\;\\text{subject
    to}\\;y_{i} \\left( {\\omega^{T} \\varvec{\\varphi }\\left( {x_{i} } \\right)
    + b} \\right) \\ge 1 - \\c{c}_{i} ,\\;\\c{c}_{i} \\ge 0,\\;i = 1, \\ldots ,n$$
    Its dual is: $$\\min\\nolimits_{{\\alpha \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^{T} Q\\alpha - e^{T}
    \\alpha }},\\;\\text{subject to}\\;y^{T} \\alpha = 0,\\;0 \\le \\alpha_{i} \\le
    C,\\;i = 1, \\ldots ,n$$ where e is the vector of all ones, C > 0 is the upper
    bound, Q is an n by n positive semi-definite matrix, \\(Q_{ij} \\equiv y_{i} y_{j}
    K\\left( {x_{i} ,x} \\right)\\), where K \\(K\\left( {x_{i} ,x_{j} } \\right)
    = \\varvec{\\varphi }\\left( {x_{i} } \\right)^{T} \\varvec{\\varphi }\\left(
    {x_{j} } \\right)\\) is the kernel φ. The function is used to implicitly map training
    vectors to bigger dimensional space. The decision function is: $$ {\\text{sgn}}
    \\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {y_{i} \\alpha_{i} K\\left( {x_{i} ,x} \\right)
    + \\rho } } \\right) $$ (22) For the given training set, xi represents the feature
    which can be SURF or HOG as extracted from the previous step and yi ε {0,1}, where
    0 represents weed, and 1 represents the plant. These features are the vectors,
    and the hyper-plane is calculated. The penalty is a squared l2 with regularization
    parameter. Experimental setup The weed detection model is deployed on a four-wheeled
    field robot. The root is 45 cm tall and about 40 cm. The camera is hoisted on
    top of the robot and is connected to a Raspberry Pi module. The raspberry pi module
    controls the physical movements and classifies the image captured by the camera
    as shown in Fig. 8. Based on the prediction of the model, the robot then sprays
    the weedicides if weeds are detected in the captured image. Fig. 8 Block diagram
    of WDS Full size image A Raspberry Pi 3 camera module night vision camera is used
    to capture the field image in natural lighting. The camera is fixed at a height
    of 45 mm from the ground. The captured image is then processed by the Raspberry
    Pi 3 module mounted on the chassis of the robot. The chassis of the robot is a
    45 mm × 45 mm × 45 mm structure with four wheels (two motors on the back wheels)
    attached to four legs and a platform to accommodate the Raspberry Pi module, battery,
    circuitry and the weedicide tank attached to the spraying mechanism as shown in
    Fig. 9 (Table 1). Fig. 9 Weed detection system field robot Full size image Table
    1 Specifications of the components used in the WDS robot Full size table Results
    and discussion The WDS which uses machine learning algorithms and field robot
    design is implemented using Python and trained for both CWFID and custom datasets.
    Once the model is trained, it is saved as.h5 model file and then deployed in the
    Raspbian OS of the hardware setup. The robot was then programmed to move and capture
    pictures every square foot. The captured image is processed by the Raspberry Pi
    board which uses the.h5 model file to decide whether to spray weedicide or not.
    The results of the previous work of Haug et al (2014) using Jaccard index for
    segmentation and Haug et al (2014) using spatial smoothing and interpolation techniques
    are taken from their work. The trained model was tested using the testing set.
    The classification report was generated with precision, accuracy and recall as
    the metrics. The results are tabulated for both CWFID and custom datasets as shown
    in Table 2. Table 2 Performance results of the previous works Full size table
    From Table 3, the results show that the SVM model after feature extraction using
    histogram of gradients for the custom dataset, and the best accuracy of 83% has
    been achieved. Also, it has a recall of 0.83 which means 83% of the predicted
    results are true positives. And the precision of 0.85 implies 85% of the actual
    results are true positives. On the other hands, logistic regression model after
    feature extraction using SURF for the CWFID dataset has the least accuracy of
    56%. Thus, it is evident that SVM outperforms logistic regression in both the
    feature extraction techniques and with both the datasets. Table 3 SVM along with
    both feature extraction methods SURF and HOG outperforms the logistic regression
    model which is evident from the underlined values of Table 3 Full size table The
    hassle of a weed detection task depends on the discrimination between the weed
    and the crop plant leaves that often have similar properties. Generally, the following
    four categories of features, i.e. biological morphology, spectral features, visual
    textures and spatial contexts, are used. This work aims to test out the more generic
    feature extraction methods, namely HOG and SURF, for this purpose. In the HOG
    feature descriptor, the distribution (histograms) of directions of gradients (oriented
    gradients) is used as features. Gradients (x and y derivatives) of an image are
    useful because the magnitude of gradients is large around edges and corners (regions
    of abrupt intensity changes), and it is known that the edges and corners pack
    in a lot more information about object shape than flat regions. It was observed
    that compared to the existing work done with the CWFID dataset, the usage of HOG
    has had a significantly higher accuracy when used with both SVM and logistic regression.
    SURF is good at handling images with blurring and rotation, but not good at handling
    orientation and illumination change. And usage of SURF resulted in a reduced accuracy
    which could be the consequence of illumination change in the dataset and the size
    of the leaves in question. As in the case of the custom dataset, SURF outperforms
    HOG with both the classification algorithms. The accuracy of SURF and HOG along
    with SVM has improved by 20% compared to the other classification models. This
    makes these two techniques better alternatives when the exact features to be considered
    are indiscriminate. Conclusion and future work In this paper, an efficient automated
    weedicide detection system using feature extraction algorithms and machine learning
    techniques hosted on a field robot that can work on smart agricultural field is
    developed. This study uses CWFID dataset and custom dataset generated by the field
    robot for the removal of weeds. The system showed different results for various
    methods. Combination of feature extraction methods and the machine learning methods
    helped in identifying the best method for weed and crop detection. From the experimental
    results, it is concluded that HOG followed by SVM proves to be best one, and the
    same has been deployed to automate the weed detection system. In future, the field
    robot can be built to customize according to the type of crops grown and size
    of the cultivable land. Moreover, an app would be developed to completely take
    care of the weed removal process, beginning from the locations where herbicide
    was sprayed to detect the weeds in the field and suggest suitable methods to encounter
    them and thus contribute towards the sustainable agricultural growth. References

  description: The Leibniz Innovation Farm (InnoHof) will develop and test leading-edge
    concepts and technologies for a sustainable, circular bioeconomy with various
    elements such as crop production, animal husbandry, research biorefinery, algae
    cultivation, insect rearing, natural fiber processing, production of biochemicals,
    and residue management through an on-site biogas plant. It will additionally focus
    on the transfer of technology and knowledge to farmers and the communication of
    modern, sustainable agriculture practices and biomass production to consumers.
    InnoHof will extend, diversify, and digitize an existing agricultural farm in
    Groß Kreutz, Germany, and be managed by the Leibniz Institute for Agricultural
    Engineering and Bioeconomy (ATB) in cooperation with numerous industrial and research
    partners. In order to enable modern research methods and measurement techniques
    for the numerous studies that will be carried out by the InnoHof scientists and
    farmers, a comprehensive Internet of Things (IoT) system will be developed, including
    • widely-distributed sensor networks for automated and manually-controlled, mobile
    and stationary equipment for status detection (soil, plant, insect, animal, environmental
    conditions, biodiversity, and so on), • still, spectral, and video systems using
    fixed and equipment-mounted (including drone) cameras, • realtime monitoring of
    barn climate and animal welfare, • specific farm equipment and implements for
    precision agriculture and on-farm field experiments, • robotics and Global Navigation
    Satellite System technology for automation of new plant production techniques,
    • communication and IT infrastructure for field monitoring stations as well as
    highbandwidth and reliable site connectivity, • highly extensible computing and
    storage resources on site to securely store and process petabyte-scale data, •
    modern virtualisation solutions to react flexibly and effectively to changing
    and rapidly growing requirements in storage and computing, • traditional and AI-based
    methods for data analysis, • implementation of digital twins based on sensor inputs
    to monitor, simulate, and control sundry farming, processing, and renewable energy
    systems, and • a comprehensive data management system to handle manual and automated
    ingestion of data, control access rights for proprietary data, ensure FAIR (findable,
    accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles, and simplify steps needed
    to publish datasets in order to enhance use and reuse of data and maximize scientific
    output. The InnoHof farm has a land area of approximately 950 ha, with scattered
    fields located at distances up to about 10 km from the main research station in
    Groß Kreutz, presenting challenges for designing and implementing an IT infrastructure
    plan for a continuous, realtime sensor network. A feasibility study to determine
    the necessary usage requirements is currently underway. As InnoHof is planned
    to be a flexible research infrastructure, providing facilities for new research
    projects and open to new collaboration partners in the future, the InnoHof IoT
    infrastructure will be designed to be scalable, accepting changing sensor configurations
    and ever-increasing requirements for data storage and processing. We present here
    a status report on the IoT platform design and implementation.

  description: 'The world society needs to produce more food with the highest quality
    standards to feed the world population with the same level of nutrition. Microfarms
    and local food production enable growing vegetables near the population and reducing
    the operational logistics costs related to post-harvest food handling. However,
    it isn''t economical viable neither efficient to have one person devoted to these
    microfarms task. To overcome this issue, we propose an open-source robotic solution
    capable of performing multitasks in small polyculture farms. This robot is equipped
    with optical sensors, manipulators and other mechatronic technology to monitor
    and process both biotic and abiotic agronomic data. This information supports
    the consequent activation of manipulators that perform several agricultural tasks:
    crop and weed detection, sowing and watering. The development of the robot meets
    low-cost requirements so that it can be a putative commercial solution. This solution
    is designed to be relevant as a test platform to support the assembly of new sensors
    and further develop new cognitive solutions, to raise awareness on topics related
    to Precision Agriculture. We are looking for a rational use of resources and several
    other aspects of an evolved, economically efficient and ecologically sustainable
    agriculture.'

    standards to feed the world population with the same level of nutrition. Microfarms
    and local food production enable growing vegetables near the population and reducing
    the operational logistics costs related to post-harvest food handling. However,
    it isn’t economical viable neither efficient to have one person devoted to these
    microfarms task. To overcome this issue, we propose an open-source robotic solution
    capable of performing multitasks in small polyculture farms. This robot is equipped
    with optical sensors, manipulators and other mechatronic technology to monitor
    and process both biotic and abiotic agronomic data. This information supports
    the consequent activation of manipulators that perform several agricultural tasks:
    crop and weed detection, sowing and watering. The development of the robot meets
    low-cost requirements so that it can be a putative commercial solution. This solution
    is designed to be relevant as a test platform to support the assembly of new sensors
    and further develop new cognitive solutions, to raise awareness on topics related
    to Precision Agriculture. We are looking for a rational use of resources and several
    other aspects of an evolved, economically efficient and ecologically sustainable
    agriculture. Published in: 2021 International Symposium of Asian Control Association

    SECTION I. Introduction Society seeks solutions that promote food production near
    consumption (“short-circuit”), which, in addition, ensure product quality, are
    economically efficient and environmentally responsible. These solutions must be
    user-friendly, assume high levels of autonomy and precision ensuring that the
    end-user routine is not disrupted. Additionally, the local production of food
    cannot be linked directly with environmental sustainability. Farm machinery and
    sustainable agriculture must evolve together [1]. To cope with this fact improving
    production efficiency, productivity and profitability, can be applied to these
    systems some concepts of Precision Agriculture, considering, in particular, the
    use of robots and intelligent systems. Autonomous robotic systems are useful in
    various agronomic operations. They can collect and process large volumes of data,
    which support solving specific problems or fill gaps in the farmer’s knowledge,
    both at the plant level or entire field level. The design of such robots must
    respect several characteristics, such as: compact structure, autonomy, intelligence,
    communication capacity, safety and reliability, adaptability and efficiency [2].
    Plant production in the cities through robotic systems (and other innovative technologies)
    reduces costs associated with food logistics [3]. For instance, Land Care Robot
    designed by dCentralized Systems Inc. [4] performs a wide variety of land preparation
    tasks (mowing, trimming, grading). This robot can be used in small farms and is
    very versatile since it supports existing implements and attachments. The company
    Naïo Technologies assembles for the publics of market farmers (e.g. vegetables,
    nurseries, horticulture) Oz [5], weeding, transportation and harvest assistance
    robot for small-scale agriculture. FarmBot [6] is an open-source platform for
    small-scale semi-automatic production, consisting of a three-axis cartesian robot,
    associated software and documentation. It incorporates efficiency, scalability,
    and minimal labor use while enabling efficient agronomic management of plants
    growth. There are agricultural production systems on the market, with a wide range
    of possible crops, including those used daily for food. They allow the creation
    of so-called kitchen gardens. Zipgrow [7] provides “a simple, productive, easy-to-use
    hydroponic platform for homes and live commercial sales”. Grove [8] is an intelligent
    system of vegetable production inside the house, based on the aquaponic production
    system. The production of various vegetables and herbs in a system similar to
    a growth chamber is possible through the LEAF system [9]. In a project carried
    out by the MIT laboratory, the Personal Food Computer [10] was developed. It is
    small size equipment capable of controlling the environment, on a technological
    platform for vegetable growth. This article is organized as follows: section 2
    presents the overall concept of our robot, enhancing the hardware and the main
    differences compared with other similar robots. Then, the robot’s subsystems are
    described: controller, localization and plant detection, sections 3, 4 and 5,
    respectively. In section 6 some preliminary results are shown. Lastly, we make
    some conclusions about the work presented. SECTION II. The Pixelcroprobot Concept
    The PixelCropRobot was inspired by the open-source solution Farmbot [6]. Our robot
    is also an open-source solution, with a GitLab repository that contains the code,
    electrical schematics and the CAD files to the new components that were created1.
    The structure of the PixelCropRobot, shown in figure 1, was built using aluminium
    extrusions with a V-slot profile. In comparison with the FarmBot, the y and z-axis
    are practically identical. The differential factor is the absence of the xaxis
    aluminium extrusions. The stepper motors in the x-axis were substituted by two
    DC motors (power window motors), allowing the robot to move through the farms
    freely. Due to this modification, it wasn’t necessary to build a raised bed. The
    robot behaves as a differential platform and isn’t limited to only a specific
    actuation area. Another slight modification was the incorporation of two micro-switches
    on the beginning of the y and z-axis to ascertain the home position at the beginning
    of operations. The PixelCropRobot is higher than the FarmBot, being able to work
    with taller plants. The majority of the materials used to build the robot can
    be found in specialized stores for 3D printing. The remaining components were
    designed using the Fusion 360 software, whose 3D files where made publicly available.
    This includes the components that connect all four wheels to the main structure,
    the camera enclosure, the micro-switch and stepper motors support. SECTION III.
    The Pixelcroprobot Controller The control of this structure is made using an AgIoT
    (IoT solution for the Agrifood Sector), which includes a Raspberry Pi 4 and an
    ATmega32U4. The AgIoT is a modular and open-source board created by INESC TEC
    to be used in the agrofood domain2. An additional ATmega is used to manage the
    drivers of the stepper motors. The control of the DC motors is done using a PWM
    signal, that allows controlling its angular speed. This operation is achieved
    by using the MOSFET power circuits included in AgIoT, which allow to drain the
    current for the motors and interrupt or not that process, using different PWM
    values. However, using these circuits, the control of the motor direction isn’t
    possible. To invert the direction of the motors, a relay module was used. This
    inverts the current path, inverting the movement of the motors (figure 2). Fig.
    1. Structure of the PixelCropRobot. Show All Fig. 2. DC motor connections. Show
    All Two stepper motors accomplish the movement in the y and z-axis. One of them
    is attached to the moving plate that runs across the y-axis. A timing belt, fixed
    at the ends of the horizontal extrusion, engages a GT2 pulley that is fixed to
    the motor’s shaft. The other one, responsible for the vertical movement, is fixed
    to the z-axis and connected to a lead screw. Figure 3 shows the stepper motor
    on the z-axis. In order to control the stepper motors, a PCB (Printed Circuit
    Board) was designed (Figure 4). This design uses all the available pins on the
    ATmega and can control up to 3 motors. In addition, it makes available the use
    of serial, USB, I 2 C and SPI communications. The drivers used in this project
    were the DRV8825, a micro-stepping bipolar stepper motor driver which features
    an adjustable current limit. The PCB was designed using EasyEda Software. The
    communication between the different devices is done using the I 2 C protocol.
    Fig. 3. Moving plate from behind. Show All Fig. 4. PCB designed to control the
    stepper motors. Show All A. Software The programs running on the Raspberry Pi
    were created using the ROS2 framework3. The ROS2 foxy was installed on the Raspberry
    Pi OS. There are four ROS2 packages created for this project: Camera: A node responsible
    for publishing the robot’s localization using the information obtained by analyzing
    the information stored on the QR codes; I2C: A node responsible for the communication
    between the Raspberry Pi and the two ATmega32U4; Control: A node responsible for
    generating the proper commands to move the robot to the desired position; Keyboard:
    A simple program that enables the control of the robot using a keyboard. This
    node doesn’t work well on the Raspberry Pi, so it is better to run this node on
    a different computer on the same sub-network with Linux. The library used depends
    on the characteristics of the operating system. Figure 5 shows the communication
    between the nodes and other parts of the system. Fig. 5. Communication between
    the different parts of the system. Show All SECTION IV. Robot Localization System
    One of the fundamental challenges in almost all mobile robotic applications is
    finding a cost-effective, efficient and accurate localization tool. The position
    and orientation of the mobile robot must always be realized quickly and correctly
    for successful autonomous navigation [11]. In this case, the robot’s localization
    will be based on an artificial landmark, a QR code (Figure 6). This approach was
    chosen to accomplish a cost-effective solution. With trilateration [12] or triangulation
    [13] we can infer the pose of the robot. The QR codes structure contains three
    patterns: detection, alignment, and timing. Detection patterns are located in
    three of the four corners. This allows 360 degrees high-speed reading of the code
    [14]. A timing pattern of alternating black and white modules is present to help
    with the detect module sizing [15]. Fig. 6. QR code structure. Show All A. Implementation
    The image analysis and processing were developed using OpenCV4 and the information
    stored in the QR codes was decoded using the pyzbar library5. This process runs
    in a ROS2 node written in Python responsible for publishing the robot’s pose and
    orientation. There is a black frame that surrounds the QR code to facilitate the
    preprocessing. 1) Preprocessing: The image captured with the Raspberry Pi camera
    is binarised using the Mean Adaptive Threshold. A global threshold (eg. Otsu)
    will give unsatisfactory results under variable lighting conditions and the results
    using the Gaussian Adaptive Threshold were inferiors to the Mean Adaptive Threshold.
    The contours of the image are obtained using the function findContours and they
    are approximated to another shape with fewer vertices depending upon the precision
    specified (it is an implementation of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm)6. The contours
    with four sides, an aspect ratio of approximately one and an area similar to the
    QR codes are stored to further analysis. The correction of the perspective of
    the detected polygon is obtained using the warpPerspective function. The next
    step is to determine the orientation of the QR code to have information on the
    global frame. The region of interest is divided into four quadrants. A process
    similar to preprocessing is used in each quadrant to find two concentric squares
    representing the position pattern. An array is filled with 1 if a position pattern
    is found and 0 otherwise. The valid results are shown in figure 7. The array used
    to save the coordinates of the vertices is rearranged so that it matches with
    the vertices of the normalized QR code. As a result, each vertex index is represented
    in the QR code presented in figure 8. The vectors that characterize the global
    frame are obtained using equations 1 and 2. Fig. 7. Valid patterns of the orientation
    array. Show All Fig. 8. Numeration of the vertices of the normalized QR code.

    After that, is necessary to calculate the distance of the QR code to the center
    of the image to be able to calculate the position of the camera. To that end,
    the vector that goes from the center of the QR code to the center of the image,
    L, is calculated. The following equations show how to represent this vector in
    the global frame. angle=arctan2(v x 1 , v x 0 )−arctan( L 1 ,  L 0 ) (3) View
    Source L dist = L 2 0 + L 2 1 − − − − − − √ (4) View Source L ⃗  global =( L dist
    ∗cos(angle),  L dist ∗sin(angle)) (5) View Source This vector will be multiplied
    by a constant that correlates the distance in pixels with the real distance. This
    constant is calculated by dividing the actual width of the QR code by the distance
    measure in pixels. The coordinates of the QR code are retrieved using the function
    Decode of the pyzbar library. Fig. 9. Region of interest (ROI) obtained after
    preprocessing and the coordinates decoded. Show All estimate d pose =Q R − pose+K×
    L ⃗  global (6) View Source If the QR code cannot be decoded, a Gaussian Adaptive
    Threshold is applied to the region of interest, improving the decoding result
    when the shadows overlap the QR code. The orientation of the robot is the angle
    between the global frame and the image frame. θ=arctan2( x 0 ,  x 1 )−arctan2(0,1)
    (7) View Source When multiple QR codes were detected the result is the average
    of the results obtained by each QR code. SECTION V. Plant Detection A. Data Acquisition
    We create an image dataset considering the principal development phases of eight
    species accordingly to the BBCH phenological scale [16]. The species chosen are
    shown in table I. The plants were established in a greenhouse at FCUP, where plants
    were allowed to grow freely and weeds until the seedling stage (after emergence,
    when the robot will supress them) as shown by figure 10. Table I Species For the
    Dataset Construction Fig. 10. Plots with all species, seven days after seeding.
    Left: individual seeding. Right: all species shuffled, intercropped. Show All
    The images were taken by a smartphone’s camera (Huawei Mate 10 Lite7), with 16
    MP of resolution (3456 × 4608 px.). Before the generation of the dataset, we run
    some scripts to standardize the data: the file name taking into care the EPPO8
    code for correspondent specie and the date that the image was taken, resize each
    image by four times the original size (864 × 1152 px.), to make the next processing
    steps easier. The developed plant detection models were based on 4000 images corresponding
    to the eight species under study. B. Training and Evaluating SSD and YOLO Models
    The following models were tested for benchmarking purposes: i) three Single Shot
    MultiBox Detector (SSD) models from the TensorFlow database - SSD MobileNet v2,
    SSD Inception v2 and the SSD ResNet50 and ii) the You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4,
    available in the Darknet framework. These models were previously pre-trained using
    the COCO dataset. For fine-tuning the pre-trained models, we considered the default
    values of the pre-training pipeline, adjusting the batch size for the capacity
    of the available GPU. All training sessions ran for 50,000 epochs, and an evaluation
    session occurred at every 50 epochs. The YOLO v4 model learned faster and only
    7200 epochs was used for the training. Darknet had no available validation sessions,
    so it was not considered. These processes were done based on [17]. SECTION VI.
    Preliminary Pixelcroprobot Results A. Localization The algorithm was tested using
    a mobile platform (Figure 11) where the QR codes were fixed and two different
    cameras: Raspberry Pi Camera Module v29 and Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera10
    were used. The resolutions used during the tests were 1920×1080 and 1280×720 .
    Although the cameras supported higher resolution the resulting frame rate was
    very low. The results are presented in the table II. Fig. 11. Left: A mobile platform
    where the tests were realized; Right: The results obtained. Show All Table II
    Results of the Qr Code Algorithm Detection The v2 Camera had better results to
    the 1920×1080 resolution, although the field of view of this camera is lower at
    this resolution. At the 1280×720 the field of view of the two cameras is approximately
    the same. Using images with 1920×1080 resolution the program runs at 2.07 FPS
    (Frames Per Second) and using images with 1280×720 , this value rounds the 5.12
    FPS. For this reason, the resolution chosen was 1280×720 . Looking for a cost-effective
    solution, the v2 Camera was selected, albeit the worst performance presented through
    this resolution. B. Plant Detection To evaluate the models applied for plant detection,
    in particular, lettuce detection throughout the growth cycle, we assume two distinct
    problems: lettuce detection (object detection problem) and the classification
    of plants according to their development stage (image classification problem).
    The evaluation metrics were computed accordingly with [18]. Table III shows the
    confidence threshold values to optimise the F1 score, the first harmonic mean
    between precision and recall. It finds the best balance between those two metrics,
    optimising the number of True Positives while avoiding the False Positives and
    False Negatives. By the values presented in table III, we can assume that almost
    all models ensure high levels of F1 score even at low levels of confidence, get
    precision higher than 80% in all models. For the image classification problem,
    table IV shows the correct classifications for each model, accordingly to the
    development stages chosen: coty, for cotyledons, minus9 (plants with less than
    nine leaves), plus9 (plants with nine or more leaves) and ready (plants with the
    optimal size for harvesting). Table 3 Confidence Threshold That Optimises F1 Score.
    Table IV Detection Accuracy For Each Model. With the results shown in table IV
    we can ensure that all models can classify all development stages correctly, with
    high accuracy. In particular, the first two, that are the ones that need more
    weeding operations. However, for the bigger stages, the results are not so high.
    This fact can be explained by the difficulty of distinguishing the lettuce only
    by their leaves number. To cope with this, we can increase the dataset or turn
    the classification criteria more robust, considering other features. SECTION VII.
    Conclusions This paper presents the design, development and implementation of
    a farming robot for small polyculture farms. We build and test the main structure
    of a wheeled cartesian robot for agricultural purposes from a low-cost perspective.
    With the tests for localization, we can prove that it is possible to apply this
    system to the robot. We can assemble our dataset for the plant detection issue
    to train and evaluate different models, applying these models to eight species
    well known by the Portuguese consumers. Notably, for lettuce, the models can detect
    the plants and classify them according to their development stage. This is an
    essential step for the next operation, weeding. Future work must focus on testing
    the PixelCropRobot in field conditions, develop the manipulators for the operations,
    particularly the weeder, and confirm if the plant detection models can identify
    the species proposed in table I in field conditions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The environmental footprint
    of agriculture has increased rapidly over the last decades, causing several environmental
    changes, including water scarcity, climate change, land degradation, etc, [1],
    [2]. To this end, the fourth revolution of agriculture is taking into consideration
    all the primary aspects of sustainable agriculture by incorporating Information
    and Communications Technologies (ICT) into traditional farming practices [3],
    [4]. Precision agriculture is a farming system approach to quantify the crop (or
    livestock) production by observing, measuring, and responding to field metrics
    towards a low-input, high-efficiency, sustainable agriculture [5], [6]. Irrigation
    is one of the fundamental sources of agricultural productivity. It has been a
    central feature of agriculture for thousands of years. It requires almost 85%
    of the available freshwater resources [7]. During the last decades, climate change
    and over-consumption of resources have strongly affected the water resources globally
    [8]. The lack of freshwater, the reduction of water quality, as well as the water
    salinity, are some of the main reasons that agricultural community needs to take
    into consideration for water management in irrigation practices [8], [9]. Smart
    irrigation is a farming approach by applying water management (and aiming to reduce
    water usage) in cultivation. Smart irrigation systems usually apply wireless technology
    (e.g. Wireless Sensor Networks - WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    in their implementations [8], [10]. For the farming digitalization, as the fourth
    revolution of agriculture clarifies, the cornerstone is connectivity [3]. Thus,
    the key enabling technology for the next step in farming is IoT [11]. IoT technology,
    by adapting various enabling techniques, such as wireless sensor networks, big
    data, communication protocols, edge computing, and web services [12], can be applied
    in various sectors of farming including irrigation, fertilization, plant growth,
    weed management, etc. [13]. It is expected that the IoT will be one of the leading
    technologies that will transform traditional cultivation and livestock practices
    into a new aspect of intelligence in precision agriculture [13], [14]. During
    the last years, a new well-promising technique that can be applied in wireless
    sensor networking has emerged, the so-called Radio Frequency (RF) Energy Harvesting
    (EH). It can be utilized as an alternative way to deliver energy in low-power
    electronic systems, e.g. wireless and IoT sensors [15]. RF EH, as an emerging
    technology, is expected to play a pivotal role in next-generation energy-constrained
    wireless networks [16]. In outdoor environments, mobile communication networks
    provide one of the dominant ambient sources for energy harvesting [17]. In this
    paper, a smart irrigation system, the so-called AREThOU5A, that adopts several
    state-of-the-art technologies, such as IoT and machine learning, is presented
    for water management in various agricultural fields. The AREThOU5A IoT platform
    will provide a smart irrigation system that exploits the specific capabilities
    of 5G networks. Moreover, it will support an alternative way of delivering energy
    to the IoT sensors of its wireless sensor network, by utilizing the RF EH technology.
    To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that a smart irrigation
    system adopts these two key-enabling technologies (5G and RF EH) in the field.
    This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we perform an outline of the
    existing smart irrigation systems that have been published in the literature.
    It is noteworthy that in the literature review, we have taken into consideration
    the variability of these irrigation systems demonstrated in various geographical
    zones, including harsh environments (extreme meteorological conditions), as well
    as the various communication technologies that acquire. In Section III, we describe
    in detail the AREThOU5A smart irrigation system, by analyzing its main subsystems,
    its layered architecture stack, as well as its processes and methods that each
    layer includes. Moreover, in Section IV, the experimental validation of the RF
    EH module that is included in the measurement subsystem is demonstrated. Finally,
    Section V draws some concluding comments and remarks. SECTION II. Related Work
    In this section, we briefly describe the smart irrigation systems of the literature
    that present different techniques in water management, by notating the origin
    of the demonstrations of these systems in the field, the adopted technologies,
    as well as the various communication protocols that include in their implementations.
    There are several water management models or platforms presented in the literature
    that combine various technologies to deliver smart irrigation systems in agriculture.
    The authors in [7] proposed a smart sensor for automatic drip irrigation that
    was applied for paddy cultivation in India. The wireless sensor connectivity was
    based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocol to transfer the
    measured data from the field to farmer’s mobile terminal. In a similar way, the
    authors in [18] developed a system of wireless sensors architecture for irrigation
    water management in Spain. The proposed architecture was based on various wireless
    nodes that were equipped with General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) protocol for
    the communication with their database. A more sophisticated approach has been
    applied in [19]. The authors proposed a novel architecture for smart agriculture
    by utilizing cognitive radio technology in the IoT driven system. They used two
    different data types to model the various conditions of crops, especially in countries
    with limited resources. In [20], the authors demonstrated a new platform for precision
    agriculture, including smart irrigation and fertilization management techniques.
    Their objective was to develop a precision agriculture platform based on open-source
    software technologies and open communication protocols. A quite interesting solution
    describing an ecosystem of interconnected was presented in [21]. The authors analyzed
    their IoT agnostic architecture as an IoT platform and they validated it in a
    smart farming scenario. Various smart irrigation platforms (or systems) have been
    introduced in the literature, which their experimental validation fields origins
    from different geographical zones. In [22], the authors developed a dynamic model
    to establish a water management system for irrigation in Central Taiwan, by confronting
    a rather harsh environment, including typhoons and uneven rainfalls in an annual
    period. A real-time model was introduced in [23] to synchronize the available
    power from a photovoltaic system with the required energy to operate an irrigation
    system. Their model was applied in a real olive orchard in Southern Spain. The
    authors in [24] developed an IoT-based smart irrigation platform for precision
    agriculture and validated in four different experimental pilots in Brazil, Spain,
    and Italy. Their findings revealed the specific on-site requirements of these
    systems and, in some cases, the designed re-configurations that required. In the
    literature, the issue of water management in environments with extreme meteorological
    conditions has been addressed, indicating the significance of the topic. The authors
    in [25] discussed the problem of water management in several parts of Africa.
    They presented a smart irrigation system based on an Arduino microcontroller for
    algorithm control configuration to manage the water availability in an effective
    way. Another interesting work has been presented in [26]. The authors created
    an irrigation tool to assist cultivators in water management for their fields
    by taking into consideration the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon
    that affects the climate in Mozambique and, consequently, the water requirements
    for agricultural crop growth of tomato in the same area. There are a couple of
    smart irrigation systems for precision agriculture that utilize fuzzy logic in
    their scheduling algorithms to deliver efficient water management. In [27], the
    authors demonstrated a scalable smart irrigation system applied to precision agriculture
    by integrating a fuzzy logic strategy. Their objective was to optimize the volumetric
    water content in the soil by reducing water usage and improving the quality of
    products. Moreover, the authors in [28] presented an IoT enabled WSN framework
    for precision agriculture by automating the various cultivation processes. They
    combined neural network prediction and structural similarity techniques to optimize
    water usage in soil. Based on these two techniques, they applied valve control
    in a smart irrigation system by utilizing a fuzzy logic-based weather condition
    modeling system. Finally, the architecture of a smart irrigation system using
    monitoring and actuating capabilities by including the fuzzy logic as a decision
    support tool was demonstrated in [29]. Several intelligent irrigation systems
    engage key enabling technologies, such as thermal imaging, big data, and machine
    learning. The authors in [30] combined the use of thermal images from the field
    to provide information about the soil moisture, of an IoT sensor network to measure
    temperature and humidity, and the cloud to collect and process all the acquired
    data in a cost effective way, to develop a smart irrigation system for precision
    agriculture. Moreover, the authors in [31] demonstrated and validated a decision
    support system for automatic smart irrigation that utilizes two different machine
    learning techniques (Partial Least Square Regression - PLSR and Adaptive Neuro
    Fuzzy Inference System - ANFIS) as reasoning engines against decisions taken by
    a cultivator expert. In a similar way, the authors in [32] combined the open source
    technologies and the machine learning techniques to present and test a smart irrigation
    system that predicts the irrigation requirements of the field. Finally, a water
    and fertilizer smart system using big data was integrated in [33]. During the
    last years, several emerging technologies have been applied in smart irrigation
    systems, such as the Message Queue Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT) and the
    LoRa (Low Range) protocol. MQTT is a lightweight network messaging protocol for
    small sensors in WSNs, suitable for the deployment of various applications in
    IoT networks, including agriculture and livestock [34]. MQTT has been successfully
    utilized in several smart irrigation systems to exchange information between the
    sensors and the central unit (server) [35]–[38]. Moreover, the LoRa is a low-power
    wide-area network protocol (LPWAN) that uses sub-GHz frequencies enabling long-range
    transmissions with low-power consumption. LoRa is one of the key solutions to
    deploy IoT sensor networks in agriculture, especially in cases of open fields
    that usually cover large areas [38], [39]. Various experimental prototypes of
    smart irrigation systems for water management that utilize commercial electronics
    have been proposed in the literature. Their implementations were based on microcontrollers
    with ultra-low-power technology [40]–[43], single-board computers [44], [45],
    or wireless connectivity modules [46], [47]. Smart irrigation techniques are applicable
    not only to cultivation fields, which are usually open areas, but in greenhouses
    and tunnel farming as well. In [48], the authors used a smart irrigation system
    to study the effects of greenhouse water management in tomato plants. Moreover,
    the authors in [49] utilized a prototype-cloud connected sensor-based irrigation
    system in greenhouse soil-less cultivation for basil production. Finally, an intelligent
    approach for efficient plant irrigation in tunnel farming has been proposed and
    validated in [50]. SECTION III. The AREThOU5A IoT Platform In this section, we
    describe in detail the system overview of the AREThOU5A IoT platform, including
    its subsystems, the layered architecture approach of the platform, including the
    processes and methods applied at each layer, as well as the rectenna (rectifier
    + antenna) module that has been designed and fabricated to deliver energy to the
    IoT wireless sensor nodes of the system from ambient and/or dedicated sources
    in an outdoor environment. A. Smart Irrigation IoT Platform Overview The main
    objective of the AREThOU5A is to exploit state-of-the-art technologies towards
    the design and fabrication of a fully integrated IoT platform to manage the irrigated
    water in cultivation as a precision agriculture application. To this end, it combines
    wireless sensor network data, collected from the field, and satellite data, provided
    by international weather forecast services, to provide efficient water usage strategies
    for cultivators. Moreover, it adopts several enabling technologies, such as LPWAN,
    RF energy harvesting, and machine learning, to enhance solutions and practices
    towards sustainable agriculture. AREThOU5A IoT platform consists of four independent,
    yet fully functional primary subsystems; the measurement subsystem, the routing
    subsystem, the user-interface subsystem, and the server subsystem (Fig. 1). Several
    other secondary subsystems exist within the platform; the external systems, which
    are connected through the Internet using cloud applications, the access subsystem,
    for the interconnection between the IoT end-nodes and the IoT gateway, the network
    subsystem, providing connection between the IoT gateway and the Internet subsystem,
    and the Internet subsystem, for the interconnection between the IoT sensor network
    with the server subsystem, the user-interface subsystem, and the external systems
    (Fig. 1). Measurement Subsystem: The measurement subsystem collects all the required
    data to operate the IoT platform efficiently. The heart of the sensor network
    is the IoT end-node (Fig. 2). It comprises of the following modules (a) a LoPy4
    microcontroller (Pycom © 2020) for handling the IoT sensors of the module and
    pre-processing the measurement data; the microcontroller is equipped with various
    state-of-the-art communication protocols, such as LoRa LoRaWAN) and SigFox, (b)
    two different IoT sensors for measuring the temperature (DS18B20 Programmable
    Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer, © 2020 Maxim Integrated) and the soil moisture
    (ECH2O EC-5 Moisture Sensor, Meter Environment, © 2017–2020 METER Group, Inc.)
    on the field, (c) a sensor driving circuit, and (d) a proper power supply (Fig.
    2 omits the photovoltaic module and/or the RF energy harvesting module of the
    subsystem). Fig. 3 displays a photograph of the AREThOU5A IoT end-node installed
    on a perennial olive field in southeast Greece (Petas village, Achaia). Routing
    Subsystem: The routing subsystem controls and routes all the information of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform between its subsystems. To this end, it is equipped with
    both LoRaWAN and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL) network interface. From the LoRa network, it operates as an
    IoT gateway, collecting all the information from the IoT end-nodes and performing
    administration processes. On the other hand, from the TCP/IP SSL network, it operates
    as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture within the IoT platform. User-Interface
    Subsystem: The user-interface subsystem provides a user-friendly environment for
    the rest of the IoT platform. It is based on an open-source LoRaWAN network server
    stack (The ChirpStack project, available at https://www.chirpstack.io/project/),
    which supports several components (LoRaWAN devices, LoRa gateways and gateway
    bridges, network and application servers, and an end-application) communicating
    with the MQTT protocol. Server Subsystem: The server subsystem includes e-mail
    administration services and database services to support the user-interface subsystem,
    as well as the measurement subsystem since it stores all the pre- and meta-processed
    data to a dedicated database management system. Fig. 1. The AREThOU5A smart irrigation
    IoT platform and its subsystems. Show All Fig. 2. The IoT end-node of the AREThOU5A
    platform (The RF energy harvesting circuit is omitted). Show All Fig. 3. Installation
    of the AREThOU5A IoT end-node in a perennial olive field. Show All B. Layered
    Architecture Approach AREThOU5A IoT platform for water management in smart irrigation
    is deployed in a five-layered architecture approach (Fig. 4). Looking at the Fig.
    4 from the bottom to the top, the following layers are stacked: Physical Layer
    (L1): The physical layer concentrates all the required processes and methods related
    to the measurements on the field. Among others, it is responsible for the collection
    of raw measurement data, the copy of data in the server storage, and the diagnostic
    information retrieved from the sensors of the platform. Data Link Layer (L2):
    In the data link layer, as the next layer in the hierarchy to the physical layer,
    the processes performed are related to the data acquisition and analysis upon
    request from the user-interface subsystem. Some of the methods applied in this
    layer are the machine learning and the open-source database management system
    utilized in the platform. Network Layer (L3): The third layer in AREThOU5A architecture
    stack is the network layer. Several processes of protocol functions operate within
    this layer, i.e. routing data, data synchronization between user-interface and
    server subsystem, data transfer through IoT protocol, etc. The main protocols
    involved in this layer are the LoRaWAN, the MQTT, and the TCP/IP. Authentication
    Layer (L4): The authentication layer adds an encryption interface to the communication
    protocols between the subsystems of the IoT platform to ensure data integrity
    and credibility. The utilized technology that establishes encrypted links in this
    layer is the SSL. Application Layer (L5): The top layer in the AREThOU5A architecture
    stack is the application layer. As the definition implies, it contains all the
    application peripheral interfaces (APIs) designed and developed for the functional
    operation of the IoT platform. The Chirpstack web interface is one of the primary
    applications included in this layer. Among others, the machine learning API, the
    e-mail API, and the data storage API are also included here. Fig. 4. AREThOU5A
    layered architecture stack. Show All C. Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting Module
    The AREThOU5A IoT platform combines several key-enabling technologies, such as
    RF energy harvesting. As previously stated, to the best of the authors’ knowledge,
    this is the first time that a smart irrigation system incorporates the wireless
    power transfer (WPT) technique to deliver energy to the sensor nodes of the IoT
    network (in our case to the IoT end-node of the AREThOU5A platform), which are
    usually require small amounts of power to operate. The cornerstone module for
    wireless power transfer is a rectenna. Fig. 5 displays the main components of
    a rectenna module. It consists of an antenna, an impedance matching network, an
    RF-to-DC rectifier, and a load. The operation of a rectenna is summarized as follows.
    The antenna in a rectenna module operates as a receiver of the electromagnetic
    radiation from ambient (e.g. FM/TV broadcasting, mobile communication networks,
    etc.) and/or dedicated RF sources. The matching network adjusts the input impedance
    of the antenna to the input impedance of the RF-to-DC rectifier, so a maximum
    RF-to-DC power conversion is achieved by the module (maximization of the RF-to-DC
    efficiency). The RF-to-DC rectifier transforms the RF power that has been received
    from the antenna to DC voltage. Finally, the load completes the rectenna module.
    In various application solutions, a voltage management and energy storage circuit
    is added between the RF-to-DC rectifier and the load, to adjust the DC voltage
    for energy storage to a capacitor or a battery. Fig. 5. Typical block diagram
    of a rectenna module (the main parts in each sub-module of the rectenna module
    are demonstrated; the voltage management and storage circuit is omitted). Show
    All SECTION IV. Experimental Evaluation Within the context of the AREThOU5A IoT
    platform, an experimental setup of the RF energy harvesting module is fabricated.
    The antenna component is a dual E-shaped patch antenna, operating in the frequency
    bands of LoRaWAN and EGSM-900 mobile communication networks (tuning frequencies
    866 MHz and 937 MHz). The choice of a patch antenna as the receiving component
    of the rectenna module is adopted based on the comparative advantages that this
    type of antenna presents (ease of fabrication, low to medium design complexity,
    and low cost). The E-shaped patch antenna is made of copper material (conductivity
    = 5.80E+07 Siemens/m, relative permeability = 1). It is fabricated on an FR-4
    substrate (relative permittivity = 4.4, substrate thickness = 1.6 mm, dielectric
    loss tangent = 0.02); a microstrip line is properly attached to the patch antenna
    to forward the harvesting energy to the RF-to-DC rectifier. The length of the
    microstrip line is selected to adjust the input impedance of the antenna to the
    impedance of 50 Ω , to the input impedance of the RF-to-DC rectifier, thus achieving
    a maximum power transfer. Details about the design method of the antenna component,
    the population-based algorithm that was selected to optimize the antenna parameters
    on the desired tuning frequencies, the overall optimization process, as well as
    the numerical results obtained by the antenna design can be found in [51]. Fig.
    6 illustrates the fabricated E-shaped patch antenna for the RF EH module of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform. Fig. 6. Photo of the fabricated E-shaped patch antenna
    for the RF EH module of the AREThOU5A IoT platform. Show All The RF-to-DC rectifier
    component of the RF energy harvesting module in the AREThOU5A IoT platform is
    a two-stage rectifier circuit based on the Greinacher voltage doubler, operating
    in the frequency bands of LoRaWAN and EGSM-900 mobile communication networks.
    These frequency bands are the same as the operating frequency bands of the antenna
    component. Fig. 7 depicts the schematic diagram of the proposed two-stage rectifier
    circuit. It consists of four zero bias Schottky surface-mount Avago HSMS-285C
    diodes ( D 1 − D 4 ), four AVX capacitors of 100 pF ( C 1 − C 4 ), and an output
    load resistor ( R L ). The input impedance of the rectifier is adjusted to the
    impedance of 50 Ω by the use of a matching network. Thus, the input impedance
    of the antenna is matched to the input impedance of the rectifier to achieve maximum
    power conversion. The RF-to-DC rectifier is made of copper material; it is fabricated
    on an FR-4 substrate as well as the antenna component of the RF EH module. Details
    about the rectifier design, its tuning operation, and its performance can be found
    in [52]. Fig. 8 illustrates the fabricated RF-to-DC rectifier for the RF EH module
    of the AREThOU5A IoT platform. The RF input signal ( P in ) is converted to DC
    voltage using the Schottky diodes. The matching network adjusts the input impedance
    of the rectifier to the input impedance of the antenna and the microstrip line,
    thus minimizing the reflected wave of the component. The capacitors of the fabricated
    rectifier perform a smoothness of the obtained DC output. Finally, the output
    power supplies the load resistor R L . Fig. 7. Schematic diagram of the proposed
    dual-band rectifier. Show All Fig. 8. Photo of the fabricated RF-to-DC rectifier
    for the RF EH module of the AREThOU5A IoT platform. Show All Fig. 9 portrays the
    reflection coefficient versus frequency of the dual-band E-shaped patch antenna.
    The green solid line represents the computed by a numerical method (Finite Element
    Method - FEM) reflection coefficient ( S 11 ) of the designed (and optimized)
    antenna [51], whereas the blue dash line displays the measured reflection coefficient
    of the fabricated antenna. From the presented results, we can easily derive that
    simulated and measured results are in good agreement. The fabricated antenna is
    satisfactorily tuned at two different frequency bands with minimum values of S
    11 equal to −31.18 dB at 870 MHz and −27.84 dB at 937.5 MHz, which are close to
    the tuned frequencies of the designed antenna (−34.31 dB at 865.1 MHz and −32.06
    dB at 935.8 MHz) presented in [51]. Moreover, the −10 dB measured bandwidth of
    the fabricated antenna at the previously mentioned frequency bands (847.5 MHz
    - 895 MHz, 922.5 MHz - 950 MHz) practically covers both the European LoRaWAN frequency
    band (863 MHz - 870 MHz) and the EGSM-900 mobile communication frequency band
    (925 MHz - 960 MHz). Finally, the dual-band E-shaped patch antenna exhibits acceptable
    values of gain (5.0 dBi at 870 MHz and 4.8 dBi at 937.5 MHz) and satisfactory
    values of efficiency (81% at 870 MHz and 78% at 937.5 MHz) in the frequency bands
    of interest. Fig. 9. Reflection coefficient ( S 11 ) of the E-shaped patch antenna
    for the RF EH module of the AREThOU5A IoT platform (green solid line: simulated
    results [51], blue dash line: measured results, red dot line: −10 dB limit). Show
    All Fig. 10 illustrates the efficiency versus RF input power of the RF-to-DC rectifier
    for two different values of the load resistor R L . The green color (solid line:
    computed results, dash line: measured results) corresponds to the efficiency for
    R L =7 kOhms, whereas the blue color (solid line: computed results, dash line:
    measured results) presents the efficiency for R L =20 kOhms. From the presented
    results, we can easily extract that, for P in =0 dBm and R L =20 kOhms, both computed
    and measured efficiency of the RF-to-DC rectifier are equal to 23.4%. Moreover,
    for P in =0 dBm and R L =7 kOhms, the obtained efficiency is 73.5% and 68%, respectively.
    The maximum simulated and measured efficiency of 75% and 73.6% are achieved for
    P in =2 dBm and 4.8 dBm, accordingly. Considering Fig. 10, we can also notice
    that the measured power conversion efficiency varies from 56% to 72% ( R L =7
    kOhms), when the RF power signals are bounded between −5 dBm and 5 dBm, respectively.
    In most cases, the circuit’s performance does not exceed 50%, if we take into
    account the given operating frequencies [53], [54]. Furthermore, it is also noteworthy
    that, for an input power equal to −15 dBm, the measured efficiency is above 20%,
    which confirms the system’s acceptable performance. Fig. 10. Efficiency versus
    RF input power of the RF-to-DC rectifier for the RF EH module of the AREThOU5A
    IoT platform (solid lines: simulated results (green color: R L =7 kOhms, blue
    color: R L =20 kOhms) [52], dash lines: measured results (green color: R L =7
    kOhms, blue color: R L =20 kOhms)). Show All Fig. 11 portrays the relation between
    the DC voltage and the AC input power for R L =7 kOhms. Once again, the green
    solid line represents the computed result of the output voltage, whereas the blue
    dash line corresponds to its measured result. From the presented graph, we can
    derive that, for P in =0 dBm, the computed and measured values of DC output voltage
    V out across the load resistor R L are 3.5 V and 2.2 V, accordingly. Finally,
    for P in =−10 dBm, these values are 1.2 V and 0.6 V, respectively. Considering
    the application point of view, the proposed rectifier facilitates the advantage
    of feasibility, as the voltage of the two operating frequencies is good enough
    to supply a sensor (e.g. a temperature sensor). These metrics allow us to furthermore
    investigate the circuit’s performance by applying a DC-to-DC booster, to enhance
    the output voltage, and to power supply a wireless sensor network. The DC-to-DC
    booster could include a storage element, while at the same time, a set of measurements
    on the sensors’ energy consumption could be performed. Fig. 11. DC output voltage
    versus the AC input power ( R L =7 kOhms) of the RF-to-DC rectifier for the RF
    EH module of the AREThOU5A IoT platform (green solid line: simulated results [52],
    blue dash line: measured results). Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper,
    we have described and analyzed the AREThOU5A platform, an IoT platform that is
    developed to perform intelligent irrigation practices and policies in water irrigation
    management of a perennial olive field. We have presented and discussed the AREThOU5A
    IoT platform subsystems, along with their main operations, as well as the layered
    architecture stack that has been deployed. Within the context of the AREThOU5A
    IoT platform, an innovative approach for delivering power to the IoT nodes of
    the platform has been utilized. To this end, a rectenna module of the AREThOU5A
    IoT platform measurement subsystem has been fabricated. Experimental validation
    of the fabricated rectenna demonstrates an acceptable performance both for antenna
    and RF-to-DC rectifier in an outdoor environment. Measured results show satisfactory
    values of the antenna’s reflection coefficient (−31.18 dB at 870 MHz and −27.84
    dB at 937.5 MHz), as well as of the rectifier’s efficiency (68% for P in =0 dBm).
    Future work includes the installation of the rectenna module in various IoT nodes
    within a cultivation field to assess its performance. Authors Figures References

  description: Malaysia receives a lot of water from its two main monsoon periods.
    Generally, there is a lot of precipitation throughout the year, with drought periods
    lasting less than three months. To date, irrigation has been treated homogenously,
    even though soil properties can vary spatially over a field, requiring site-specific
    applications. The aim of this study was to establish an irrigation management
    zone (IMZ) covering 23.4 ha, which was previously determined under the same soil
    series. Soil sampling was done according to a grid system over an area of 100
    m × 100 m. Three soil depth ranges were examined for every sampling point, namely
    0–30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm from the soil surface. Samples were taken to a laboratory
    for physical analysis and determination of the available water-holding capacity
    (AWHC). Delineation of AWHC values was achieved using GIS software and the Kriging
    method. Estimated irrigation depth (EID) data for the plantation were collected
    for the years 2016 and 2017. Afterward, EID and total net irrigation (TNI) data
    were simulated in the FAO Cropwat model and compared. The results showed that
    clay, sand, and organic matter (OM) distributions varied with soil depth; however,
    no strong correlation was found between these variable with AWHC. The IMZ was
    classified into three areas named zones A, B, and C, ranging from 79 to 167 mm.
    The crop water requirement (CWR) was 667 mm in 2016 but only 260 mm in 2017. Based
    on the AWHC values, the EID for 2016 was found to be below the TNI requirement
    range of about 106 to 110 mm. In contrast, the EID range was approximately 34
    to 62 mm and above TNI requirements for 2017. This study indicates that water
    inputs for irrigation can be optimized with knowledge of the water-holding capacity
    of a specific soil. Subsequently, this can be related to crop yield and the impact
    on sustainable agriculture.

    keyboard_arrow_down     Browse Figures Versions Notes Abstract Malaysia receives
    a lot of water from its two main monsoon periods. Generally, there is a lot of
    precipitation throughout the year, with drought periods lasting less than three
    months. To date, irrigation has been treated homogenously, even though soil properties
    can vary spatially over a field, requiring site-specific applications. The aim
    of this study was to establish an irrigation management zone (IMZ) covering 23.4
    ha, which was previously determined under the same soil series. Soil sampling
    was done according to a grid system over an area of 100 m × 100 m. Three soil
    depth ranges were examined for every sampling point, namely 0–30, 30–60, and 60–90
    cm from the soil surface. Samples were taken to a laboratory for physical analysis
    and determination of the available water-holding capacity (AWHC). Delineation
    of AWHC values was achieved using GIS software and the Kriging method. Estimated
    irrigation depth (EID) data for the plantation were collected for the years 2016
    and 2017. Afterward, EID and total net irrigation (TNI) data were simulated in
    the FAO Cropwat model and compared. The results showed that clay, sand, and organic
    matter (OM) distributions varied with soil depth; however, no strong correlation
    was found between these variable with AWHC. The IMZ was classified into three
    areas named zones A, B, and C, ranging from 79 to 167 mm. The crop water requirement
    (CWR) was 667 mm in 2016 but only 260 mm in 2017. Based on the AWHC values, the
    EID for 2016 was found to be below the TNI requirement range of about 106 to 110
    mm. In contrast, the EID range was approximately 34 to 62 mm and above TNI requirements
    for 2017. This study indicates that water inputs for irrigation can be optimized
    with knowledge of the water-holding capacity of a specific soil. Subsequently,
    this can be related to crop yield and the impact on sustainable agriculture. Keywords:

    is the most important resource on earth; however, over 96.5% of the water on earth
    is saline, while the remainder is freshwater. A total of 68.6% of freshwater is
    locked up in the form of ice and glaciers, while another 30.1% is stored as ground
    water [1]. The human population keeps is continually increasing, reaching 7.9
    billion people in 2020 [2] and being predicted to increase by 22 to 34% by 2050
    [3]; therefore, water security, i.e., having access to an adequate quantity and
    acceptable quality of water, is already at risk and will become worse over the
    next few decades [4]. Water resources are undoubtedly declining at an alarming
    rate all around the world [5]. Valipour et al. [6] showed that the global mean
    surface temperature increased by 0.66 °C for the periods of 1961–1990 to 2000–2019.
    This parameter is the most important indicator of global warming and climate change.
    Climate change substantially impacts developing countries and can be felt through
    impacts on water supply, food security, and agricultural incomes [7]; therefore,
    irrigation planning and water management policies need to be reviewed systematically.
    Malaysia is experiencing exceptional stress on its water supply; however, 68%
    of water used in agriculture is still being managed inefficiently [8]. Based on
    projections, almost 46% of the water demand in Peninsula Malaysia or 8.39 billion
    m3 will be solely used for irrigation in 2050 [9]. To prepare for such an eventuality,
    it is expected that the focus will shift to improving water usage management rather
    than water supply management [10]. Agricultural production must also keep pace
    with the upward trend in human population growth. In Malaysia, oil palm serves
    as an important commodity crop, accounting for 37.7% of the gross output for the
    agriculture sector [11]. Worldwide consumption of palm oil has steadily increased,
    reaching about 75.45 Million MT for the 2020–2021 period [12]. Oil palm is considered
    as a robust plant that is able to grow under multiple abiotic stresses; however,
    in order to get the potential yield, every single factor that translates into
    yield is essential. Soil with low water-holding capacity is one of the major problems
    facing the industry, as this will result in low nutrient uptake, especially during
    the dry season. In addition, low water availability reduces the sex ratio and
    yield tonnage. To increase water availability, irrigation is used, although this
    requires a high initial cost per unit area. The result from a series of irrigation
    trials at Serting (Central Peninsula of Malaysia) showed that irrigation in seasonal
    dry periods may increase yields by up to 56% compared with no irrigation [13];
    however, another study in a moderately wet area showed that irrigation only resulted
    in a small improvement of 9% compared to a non-irrigated plot [14]. This shows
    that with correct area selection, irrigation may give a good response. Irrigation
    generally requires high initial costs, as it is necessary to set up water pumps,
    reservoirs, and piping networks, as well as requiring special workers and periodic
    maintenance of parts. For oil palm, it has been reported that the total costs
    amount to USD 1680 per ha for furrow systems [13]; in fact, these costs increase
    every year. Without thorough selection criteria, an irrigation project may end
    up being unprofitable or requiring a longer time to achieve a high return of investment
    (ROI) rate. In general, the amount of rainfall and the soil characteristics are
    often used as basic criteria for determination of irrigation events. If a farmers
    applies a large amount of water in a field, this may be more than enough or the
    field may be undersupplied. The question regarding water efficiency for using
    irrigation still needs to be answered, as water management schemes could become
    important in the future [15]. The palm oil industry in Malaysia is subject to
    rules and regulations set by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Under
    Principle 7 (Protect, Conserve, and Enhance Ecosystems and the Environment), water
    as one of the key resources needs to be used efficiently [16]. Recently, studies
    related to water footprints were carried out [17,18], helping improve the understanding
    of water usage. After considering the aforementioned factors, it stands to reason
    that water must be used wisely. One strategy to increase water use efficiency
    is to adopt precision irrigation (PI) in the field. The traditional practice of
    using rainfall for irrigation absolutely needs to be improved. PI concepts are
    quite new in the oil palm industry and no detailed studies have described their
    effectiveness or profitability or have proven how these concepts can be useful
    in oil palm plantations. Such approaches must be combined with soil, rainfall,
    and meteorological data, as well as current oil palm conditions. As such, this
    study was carried out to determine the spatial variability within an irrigation
    area and to evaluate existing irrigation projects based on climate and water-holding
    capacity. The hypothesis was that a higher soil water-holding capacity will lead
    to soil moisture retention over a longer time and less irrigation water being
    required. By doing this, water usage and irrigation requirements can be achieved.
    This study gives an idea of the necessity of using precision irrigation strategies
    for particular areas. Finally, estate management teams can adopt related technology
    such as soil moisture sensors to achieve better irrigation management. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Study Area A semi-commercial irrigation system was implemented
    at FGV Agri Services Sdn Bhd (FGVAS) Serting Hilir Estate, located at the center
    of Peninsula Malaysia (2°56’51” N, 102°29’20” E) (Figure 1). Oil palm was obtained
    from commercial clonal material and planted with a density of 148 palms ha−1.
    The soil was classified as Typic Kandiudult, with fine loamy, kaolinitic, and
    isohyperthermic or Haplic Acrisol characteristics, using the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) legend [19]. The soil developed over recent riverine alluvium
    and was considered as having low fertility. Figure 1. Location of irrigation project
    in the study area. 2.2. Estate Irrigation Practices Water has been delivered to
    the palms using a microsprayer irrigation system since 2015, although only fully
    commenced from 2016. One emitter was installed for every palm on a lateral polyethylene
    (PE) pipe. The average output of each emitter is 60 Lh−1. The total irrigation
    area covers 23.4 ha, which was eventually divided into three working areas. Irrigation
    events are decided based on the amount of rainfall from the previous day (an irrigation
    event requires rainfall below 5.0 mm on the previous day). The system operates
    manually, although the engine automatically stops at the end of each shift. The
    operation time for each shift was approximately two and a half hours. Based on
    the operation hours, the estimated volume of water (EVW) in liters was calculated
    for a particular year (Equation (1)) and later converted into the estimated irrigation
    depth (EID) in mm, as calculated using Equation (2). The EVW is quite straightforward,
    involving the monthly operation time in hours (T), area of irrigation (A) in ha,
    number of emitters (N) per ha, and nominal emitter flow rate (F) in Lh−1; however,
    the EID involves the area occupied oil palms based on the canopy radius (r) in
    m [20] and the density of palms per ha (D). In 2016, the palms were three years
    old and the value of r was set at 3.43 m, while in 2017 the value of r was 4.58
    m [21]. EVW = (T × A × N × F) (1) EID= 𝐸𝑉𝑊 𝜋 𝑟 2 ×𝐴×𝐷 (2) 2.3. Meteorological
    Data Collection The FAO Cropwat model was used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) by using essential data such as the minimum temperature (MnT), maximum temperature
    (MxT), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and sunshine hours (SH). For this
    purpose, a total of four national meteorological stations were selected to obtain
    an average value for the aforementioned data. These four stations were located
    within a 60 km radius from the study site, as depicted by the yellow pin shape
    on the map (Figure 2). Unfortunately, SH from these four locations were not available
    for 2016 and 2017. To overcome this, SH data were imported from the FAO Climwat
    2.0 database for nine nearby stations around the trial site, depicted by red balloon
    shapes on the map in (Figure 2). Then, these data were averaged on a monthly basis
    and inserted into the FAO Cropwat model to represent the trial site (Table 1).
    Figure 2. Google Earth map illustration showing the locations of detailed meteorological
    data collection sites. Sources used to estimate field data. Table 1. Summary of
    monthly meteorological data used in the FAO Cropwat model according to assessment
    year. 2.4. Soil Sampling A total of 28 points were selected in the field according
    to a grid system measuring 100 × 100 m. Soil was dug up using a chisel for sampling
    purposes at three depths of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the soil surface.
    Samples were collected using soil ring bulk density containers and enclosed with
    the cap on before being sent to the Soil Physics Laboratory, Universiti Putra
    Malaysia. In the laboratory, samples underwent several processes to determine
    the bulk density, volumetric water content, field capacity, and permanent wilting
    point values. For each sample, firstly the bulk density was determined, then the
    remaining soil in the ring core was removed and broken up (undisturbed) into five
    pieces of roughly equal size. Each part was placed on a ceramic plate according
    to the sampling number. Soil water retention values of 0, 1, 10, 33, and 1500
    kPa were determined using a pressure plate chamber [22,23]. The value of the available
    water-holding capacity (AWHC) in mm was calculated using Equation (3), where BD
    is the bulk density (gcm−3), Wfc is the water content at the field capacity (w/w
    %), Wwp is the water content at the wilting point (w/w %), and LT is the soil
    layer thickness (mm). In addition, samples for physical analysis were collected
    adjacent to the AWHC sample location. Samples were sent to the FGVAS laboratory
    for determination of clay, silt, and sand particles according to the pipette method.
    Small parts of the sample were also analyzed for organic matter (OM) using the
    ashing method and for organic carbon (OC) content using the Walkley–Black titration
    method. AWHC=BD × ( 𝑤 𝑓𝑐 −  𝑤 𝑤𝑝 100 ) × LT (3) 2.5. Delineation of Irrigation
    Management Zone The AWHC data based on different sampling depths were combined
    together to obtain total AWHC values of up to 90 cm. Then, these data were summarized
    according to location (longitude and latitude) in an excel file. After this, the
    data were imported into GS+ Software Version 7.0, Gamma Design Software, LLC,
    Michigan, USA for analysis and to produce a best-fitted semivariogram to assess
    the spatial function. Values for the active lag distance and lag class distance
    interval were manually inserted. The procedures started with calculation of the
    semivariance based on a maximum lag distance of 650 m, which was divided into
    five lag distance classes separated by an average of 120 m. There were at least
    38–120 pairs of points for each lag distance and most distance classes contained
    at least 38 pairs of data points. The best model for the variogram was selected
    based on visual fit and the highest R2 value of the model trendline. Later on,
    all variables used in GS+ software were utilized in ArcGIS 10.3, Esri Inc, California,
    USA software in order to make an interpolation map. Finally, data for each IMZ
    were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the Tukey–Kramer test using SAS Software
    Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. 2.6. Irrigation Requirement Simulation
    Using FAO Cropwat Version 8.0 The FAO Cropwat model was developed by FAO to estimate
    crop water requirements (CWR), especially for food crops. This computer programme
    allows the development of irrigation schedules covering different management options,
    as well as the calculation of water supply schemes for varying crop patterns.
    The data from Section 2.3 were inserted into this software according to its modules.
    Generally, four modules were involved, which were the climate/ETo, rain, crop,
    and soil modules. For the climate module, yearly MnT, MxT, RH, WS, and SH data
    were inserted into this software, then later the monthly ETo data were generated
    based on the Penman–Montieth equation. Rainfall data were inserted into the ‘rain’
    module and the effective rainfall was calculated by selecting the FAO/AGLW formula.
    For the ‘crop’ module, the planting date was set at the beginning of the year
    and the harvest date was set at the end of the year, without any crop stage. This
    was due to the oil palm crop being categorized as perennial and the observation
    period being a yearly assessment. The Kc value was set as 0.8 for the entire year,
    while the rooting depth was set as 0.60 m. In the ‘soil’ module, the average AWHC
    values from Section 2.5 were inserted into the ‘total available soil moisture’
    section according to each zone assessment. The initial soil moisture depletion
    level was set at 100% to assume that the initial soil was dry at the early stage
    for maximum estimation of the water requirements. This software automatically
    calculated the TNI (Equation (4)) derived from the field balance equation. In
    Equation (4) [24], IRn is the net irrigation requirement (mm), ETc is crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), Pe is the effective dependable rainfall (mm), Ge is the groundwater contribution
    from the water table (mm), Wb is the water stored in the soil at the beginning
    of each period (mm), and LRmm is the leaching requirement (mm). IRn = ETc − (Pe
    + Ge + Wb) + LRmm (4) 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Water Usage The study area
    received low rainfall for the year 2016, which was only 992 mm/year−1, with eight
    months receiving rainfall below 100 mm/month−1. The highest EID values were in
    February and April, which equaled 86 mm month−1, whilst the lowest was in May,
    which only 6.0 mm month−1. There were no irrigation events from November to December
    because of the sufficient rain on top of the monsoonal periods at this time (Figure
    3); however, the EVW in March was very low, even though there was a low amount
    of rainfall. The number of rainy days can indicate the total solar radiation and
    potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc); hence, a red dotted line was used at
    120 mm as a baseline, which represented the minimum value for ETc suggested by
    IRHO [25]. In Mac, the total water availability was only 21.9 mm month−1, which
    deviated by 82% from the baseline. In this case, the EID was limited to only 15.1
    mm, which was explained by the scarcity of water, including the main source from
    the river. The river water level was too low below the drawing point, meaning
    irrigation was impossible. The issue of limited water sources can be considered
    as a determinant factor for irrigation implementation. The decision to source
    other water sources such as ground water can incur high costs and can require
    further studies. Figure 3. Monthly EID and rainfall distribution for FGVAS Serting
    Hilir Estate for 2016. The year 2016 was the warmest year for Malaysia, which
    was strongly influenced by the super El Niño weather system that occurred until
    the middle of the year [26]. The opposite trend occurred for the year 2017, when
    the rainfall distribution was quite good at up to 2083 mm for the year. During
    this year, no irrigation occurred from January to March and for November to December
    (Figure 4). In fact, the rainfall amount in November was as high as 600 mm month−1.
    The gap between the water deficits (June and September) was much closer to the
    baseline. Based on [27], the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index was neutral
    starting from January 2017 until the end of November 2017, followed by a weak
    La Niña condition starting in December 2017; thus, Malaysia did not experience
    long-lasting hot and dry weather throughout 2017. Figure 4. Monthly EID and rainfall
    distribution for FGVAS Serting Hilir Estate in 2017. 3.2. Meteorological Data
    The average values for the years 2016 and 2017 for the six main parameters are
    shown in Table 1. The lowest MnT ever recorded was 21.8 °C, while the highest
    temperature was 35.7 °C. High temperatures speed up moisture losses through evaporation
    and transpiration. In terms of RH, the readings were as 86.3%, which is normal
    for tropical regions. The relative humidity and temperature mainly affect the
    vapor pressure deficit. A relative humidity of 58% at 30 °C is equivalent to an
    increase of vapor pressure deficit above 1.8 kPa, which may close the stomata
    and reduce photosynthetic activity [28]. Apart from this, the WS values were similar
    for both years. As shown in Table 1, the monthly SH values were similar for both
    years, since the data originated from one source. This was an exceptional case
    due to the data being provided by FAO Climwat, which was not time-specified. There
    are technical difficulties, costs, and maintenance aspects associated with estate
    management related to obtaining complete climatic data, except for rainfall data;
    hence, FAO Climwat is an effortless solution for accessing data, while at the
    same time providing rational results for FAO Cropwat simulations [29]. Another
    advantage of this software is that it contains 15 years of data covering almost
    5000 stations around the world [30]. All of these data points are important for
    the basic calculation or estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in FAO
    Cropwat. 3.3. Soil Data Table 2 displays the matrix correlation between the AWHC
    and analyzed soil variables. A strong negative relationship was found between
    fine sand (FS) and clay particles (r < −0.80). This indicates that one variable
    is inferior while the other one is dominant. FS was found to be negatively correlated
    with soil depth and had a high percentage of 82–83% of total sand (TS), meaning
    it dominated with a higher r2 (0.93) compared to the coarse sand (CS). AWHC is
    referred to as the capability of soil to retain water and is related to the total
    pore space. A higher pore space generally holds more water. This is aligned with
    the positive relationship between soil depth and clay particles. Clay, which is
    known to have smallest particle size in soil, has a much higher total pore space
    than other particles. Table 2. Relationships between each of the soil variables
    with AWHC. For this analysis, BD had a weak positive relationship with clay and
    a negative relationship with sand, although it proved to be statistically significant.
    This relationship might be due to the fact that lower porosity, for example in
    sandy soil, will result in higher bulk density compared to clay particles, which
    have higher total porosity. In addition, organic matter (OM) was moderately negatively
    correlated with soil depth. There was high OM at the upper part of the soil, since
    there was a lot of plant debris and other organic matter, while most of the OM
    remained at the top of soil and only a small fraction entered the soil bodies.
    OM is accepted worldwide as factor that can be used to improve the soil water-holding
    capacity; however, a strong positive relationship between OM and AWHC was not
    shown here, and in fact a negative correlation was observed. A previous study
    [31] proved that the ability of OM to improve available water capacity is very
    limited or overestimated.; any increases are more pronounce in sandy soil, followed
    by loam and clays. As such, this contradictory agreement can be explained by the
    decreasing OM availability over soil depth, which is compounded by the distribution
    of clay particles. Note: * is for p values < 0.05, ** is for p values <0.01. 3.4.
    Irrigation Management Zone The best fitting model for this data was the spherical
    isotropic variogram, with a range of 196 m and an acceptable R2 value of 0.645.
    The isotropic variogram showed that the spatial structure of the variables was
    consistent in all directions. The AWHC data were considered as strongly spatially
    dependent, as the nugget semivariance percentage was 0.19%, falling well below
    25% [32]. The effective range was 196 m, confirming that the 100 m grid point
    was acceptable (Figure 5). Figure 5. Semivariogram for AWHC data at FGVAS Serting
    Hilir Estate. Generally, ArcGIS Software produced maps with a range of classifications
    according to different color schemes based on natural break classification modules.
    There are no clear guidelines for the number of classes that should be assigned;
    however, it is advised not to exceed seven classes [33]. In order to make things
    more reliable, three classifications were performed to divide the area into zones
    A, B, and C (Figure 6). A total 9 sampling points fell under zone A, 12 under
    zone B, and 7 under zone C. Based on one-way ANOVA and the Tukey–Kramer test,
    it was shown that each zone was highly significant to the others (Table 3). The
    selection of three zones was also based on a reliable and practical perspective
    of a precision operation system that will be installed in the future. The increasing
    number of management zones also resulted in higher installation costs due to the
    control and automation requirements. Through this study, it was found that soil
    can be classified into three different categories, although all soil are under
    the same soil series. Sometimes, delineation of IMZ values can provide more sophisticated
    and advanced data. Previous studies have shown that IMZ values can be delineated
    using Sentinel-2 images or field property data [34,35]. As in this study, IMZ
    values based on AWHC data are considered stable, and as a result can be used for
    many years as initial guidelines for growers or irrigation planners; however,
    the produced IMZ maps cannot be used to provide real-time soil moisture status
    information. Figure 6. Map of the irrigation management zones in the study site,
    named zone A, zone B, and zone C. Table 3. Management of zones for the three AWHC
    categories. 3.5. Crop Water Requirement (CWR) This estate is located a dry region
    with average annual rainfall ranging from 1300 to 1800 mm per year. Based on the
    simulation, the CWR, which encompassed the total amount of water evapotranspirated,
    was 666.8 mm in 2016 and only 260.2 mm in 2017 (Table 4); however, these values
    were solely based on rainfall, without taking into consideration the soil water
    balance factor. Table 4. CWR values for Serting Estate for 2016 and 2017. 3.6.
    Comparison between TNI and EID for Each IMZ Based on the soil sampling, this field
    was divided into three management zones called zones A, B, and C, each of which
    had a different AWHC range. The different AWHC values meant the water-holding
    capacity levels varied, affecting the irrigation timing. By taking into account
    the soil water capacity as a factor, the irrigation range in 2016 was below TNI
    level, ranging from 106 to 110 mm (Table 5). The insufficient EID values were
    partly due to the limited water sources, as mentioned before. Irrigation scheduling
    for rainfall amounts such as those in this study should probably follow the basic
    guidelines for palm crops. A water balance approach can be used to keep track
    of the soil water deficit by accounting for all water additions and subtractions
    from the soil root zone [36]. Furthermore, many types of soil moisture sensors
    can provide real-time and continuous data [37,38,39], improving the water use
    efficiency. Increasing the scheduling efficiency provides the opportunity to conserve
    water resources [40]. The EID value for 2017 was 130 mm, although the maximum
    TNI was only 96 mm. The surplus EID values ranged from 34 to 62 mm. Overirrigation
    means that extra energy resources will be required, such as gasoline, human resources,
    and maintenance costs. This also results in nitrogen leaching and runoff, increases
    in weed pressure, and disease, impeding growth and yield [41]. Table 5. The TNI
    and EID values for the years 2016 and 2017 according to the management zone. 4.
    Conclusions For many years, oil palm estates have been treated homogenously and
    the irrigation scheduling has been based on rainfall availability. As shown by
    geostatistical analysis, soil types can vary spatially, even though they are classified
    under the same soil series and can be treated as IMZs. It was found that clay,
    sand, and OM distributions varied with soil depth; however, no strong correlation
    was found between soil variables and AWHC. The rainfall distribution in 2016 was
    very low, which resulted in high CWR values compared to 2017. The EID value for
    2016 of 322 mm year−1 was below requirements and contradicted the EID values for
    2017, which surplus from 34 to 62 mm. Effective rainfall, soil, meteorological,
    and crop type data are very important in order to calculate the amount of water
    to be used for irrigation. The FAO Cropwat model can be a useful tool for estimating
    CWR values for an intended area, helping with decisions related to irrigation
    projects, giving a better understanding of and strong justification for such projects.
    In the future, sensor-based irrigation scheduling will be adopted and potential

  description: Small mammals, and particularly rodents, are common inhabitants of

    they can be major pests, able to reduce crop production and farmers’ incomes,
    with tangible effects on the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals no 2
    (SDG2, Zero Hunger) of the United Nations. Farmers do not currently have a standardized,
    accurate method of detecting the presence, abundance, and locations of rodents
    in their fields, and hence do not have environmentally efficient methods of rodent
    control able to promote sustainable agriculture oriented to reduce the environmental
    impacts of cultivation. New developments in unmanned aerial system (UAS) platforms
    and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous
    multimodal data collection approaches at very high spatial resolutions in environmental
    and agricultural contexts. Object detection from remote-sensing images has been
    an active research topic over the last decade. With recent increases in computational
    resources and data availability, deep learning-based object detection methods
    are beginning to play an important role in advancing remote-sensing commercial
    and scientific applications. However, the performance of current detectors on
    various UAS-based datasets, including multimodal spatial and physical datasets,
    remains limited in terms of small object detection. In particular, the ability
    to quickly detect small objects from a large observed scene (at field scale) is

    accurate and robust detection for small objects (mAP of 0.86 and an F1-score of
    93.39%), and can deliver valuable insights for field management with high spatial

    Faster R-CNN; EfficientNet; RetinaNet 1. Introduction Sustainable agriculture
    and farm resilience are the main objectives of this century. United Nations and
    FAO, through Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2—Zero Hunger) and the Sustainable
    Crop Production Intensification (SCPI) Strategic Objective A of FAO Strategic
    Framework 2010–2019 [1], underline the need to achieve food security under climate
    change through the improvement of farm resource use efficiency and at the same
    time reducing the environmental impacts (e.g., plant biotic stress control). In
    many productive agricultural contexts, small mammals, and particularly rodents
    are common inhabitants of farmlands playing key roles in the ecosystem. However,
    when overabundant they behave as pests, able to reduce crop production and farmers’
    incomes and requiring the phytosanitary treatments of the field which are environmental
    and farmer costs [2,3]. Then an environmentally efficient method of rodent control
    able to promote sustainable agriculture, reducing the number and entity of treatments,
    oriented to reduce the environmental impacts of cultivation is not present. Currently,
    no studies have been found to indicate a reference methodology to detect the presence,
    abundance, and location of small rodent holes in the field. To address this, the
    ability to detect small objects via optical remote sensing and deep learning approaches,
    using very high-resolution imagery from unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) can be
    helpful [4], but the problem of backgrounds complexity of field images to estimate
    the exact position, localization, and classification of an object must be faced
    and overcome. Before the development of deep learning approaches, conventional
    object detection schemes for remote-sensing applications (based on handcrafted
    features and shallow machine learning models) were based on three main steps:
    (i) selecting the regions of interest (ROIs) in which objects may appear; (ii)
    extracting the local characteristics; and (iii) applying a supervised classifier
    to these features [5]. The main drawback was the limited robustness due to restrictions
    on the representation of various backgrounds in a given set of data, which created
    overfitting and required many calculations [6]. The emerging development of deep
    neural networks, and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), brought
    a substantial paradigm change and significant improvements in the generalization
    and robustness of automatic learning and extraction using features from annotated
    training data [5,7]. In many recent applications, traditional object detection
    models have been replaced by deep learning-based models, which are considered
    to be more accurate [8]. The region-based CNN (R-CNN), proposed in 2014, was a
    major milestone in object detection [9] together with other bounding box regression-based
    approaches such as Fast R-CNN [10], Faster R-CNN [11], and R-FCN (region-based
    fully convolutional network) [12]. These image segmentation methods produce a
    relatively low detection rate in natural settings [13,14]. To ensure good results,
    deep learning approaches need to include both detection and classification stages.
    For example, Faster R-CNN uses a region proposal network (RPN) method to classify
    bounding boxes, and fine-tuning is then applied to process these bounding boxes
    [15,16]. An alternative approach is a one-pass regression based on class probabilities
    and bounding box locations, as used in the single-shot multibox detector (SSD)
    [17], deeply supervised object detector (DSOD) [18], RetinaNet [19], EfficientDet
    [20], You Only Look Once (YOLO) [21,22], etc. These methods unite target classification
    and localization into a regression analysis, do not require RPN, and directly
    perform regression to detect targets in the image. The success rate of CNN-based
    object detection methods is dependent on the network architecture and the quality
    and annotation of the data. In terms of feature maps, most deep high-level maps
    have low resolution, thus making the detection of small objects a challenging
    task. Both one-stage and two-stage detector models have certain disadvantages:
    one-stage models are less detailed, and therefore have difficulty detecting small
    objects, whereas two-stage models have long process times. In comparison, the
    use of low-resolution feature maps (coarse, deep features) can reduce the performance
    of high-quality localization models due to the loss of detailed information and
    the long processing times for two-stage models. Shallow, low-level feature maps
    can reduce the representative capacity for recognition and classification. One
    possible alternative is an attention-based model, which can effectively extract
    the features of objects and enhance the detection performance through a complementary
    combination of both low- and high-level features [23]. Over the past decade, one-
    and two-stage models have been used for object detection using aerial, UAS, and
    satellite remote-sensing images [24]. However, computer vision models cannot be
    directly transferred to remote-sensing applications, in particular, due to the
    geospatial properties of the objects that appear in the scenes. As previously
    reported [25], the objects of interest in remote-sensing data are heterogeneous
    in terms of their size and shape and cover a wide range of spectral signatures
    depending on the sensor, scanning geometry, lighting, weather conditions, etc.
    Furthermore, compared with natural images (in which the focus is on the central
    foreground object of interest, the background is blurred, and images are collected
    at close range), remote-sensing images in general and UAS-based images, in particular,
    involve small objects (scanned from above from a given flight altitude) and complex
    backgrounds (where the surface of the ground around the object of interest does
    not have a specific focus or blurriness, and there is no prior identified or preferable
    foreground). Since the feature maps obtained by CNNs have gradually been reduced
    over time due to the use of convolution and down-sampling operations, the present
    study aims to investigate the accurate, detailed detection of small objects in
    UAS-based remote-sensing images. The main objective of the study is to compare
    the performance of selected one- and two-stage detector models on a single UAS-based
    image and a processed (via Pix4D mapper photogrammetric program) UAS-based orthophoto
    product for agriculture/environmental applications. We then assess and report
    on the use of a multimodal dataset for small object detection. 2. Motivation The
    2030 SDG deadline is just a decade away, and the Commitments of SDG2 include taking
    action to fight hunger and malnutrition and supporting sustainable agriculture,
    including forestry, fisheries, and pastoralism. The agenda pledges to strengthen
    efforts to enhance food security and nutrition. Therefore, it is impossible to
    skip the issue of the modern agricultural landscapes that transformed natural
    habitats into large mosaics of monoculture, containing scattered uncultivated
    regions of semi-natural habitats with varying dimensions and shapes. This variety
    of agricultural environments has resulted in a loss of habitat heterogeneity that
    affects biodiversity and ecosystem function [26]. Rodents such as Microtus voles
    play a keystone functional role within ecological communities, as they are the
    main food source for a variety of predators, and are also a major agricultural
    pest in terms of damage to field crops, stored grain, and farm equipment each
    year [27,28]. For example, in Israel, populations of Levant voles (Microtus guentheri)
    can create thousands of burrow openings per hectare [29] as a result of the voles’
    very high reproductive output. Levant voles reach reproductive age within the
    first month of being born, pregnancy lasts only 21 days, and they raise five or
    six young per litter [30,31]. Vole populations can therefore fluctuate rapidly,
    causing extensive agricultural loss [32]. To combat the problem of voles, farmers
    have used rodenticides. For example, in the United States, approximately 30 million
    pounds of rodenticides and other conventional pesticides are used in agricultural,
    suburban, and urban settings each year [33]. Although rodent baits placed in agricultural
    settings can kill rodents very effectively [27], they pose a potential threat
    to non-target wildlife through secondary poisoning [34] and there are also fears
    of resistance [35,36]. The cost of controlling voles is high, not only due to
    the damage caused but because rodenticides are expensive (in terms of the cost
    of purchasing and distribution in the field). Although integrated pest control
    methods for controlling voles have been suggested that combine irrigation to flood
    fields and the introduction of natural predators [37,38], these methods have not
    solved the problem completely, and rodenticide is still used. One of the major
    problems with controlling voles is that farmers do not have methods for determining
    the abundance and locations of voles in their fields. In general, farmers only
    start to notice voles when the population is large since damage from voles creates
    “bald” sections in the field that are visible. Farmers traditionally apply large
    amounts of rodenticide as a form of prevention, before they even see the voles,
    and add even larger quantities when they see the damage. There is, therefore,
    a need to develop a method of determining the locations of the voles in a field
    when the population numbers are small; this would allow farmers to control only
    certain specific areas, therefore increasing the efficiency of control and reducing
    the amounts of rodenticide required. Precision agriculture (PA) is a method of
    managing crop fields that takes into consideration spatial variation and local
    field requirements. PA involves data collection to characterize the spatial variability
    of fields, mapping, decision making, and the implementation of management practices
    [39]. The development of UAS-borne remote-sensing imagery has increased the number
    of precision agriculture applications, due to the ability of UASs to carry out
    cost-effective, low-altitude flights in small fields and to produce images with
    high spatial (i.e., centimeter) and temporal (i.e., daily) resolutions [40]. The
    main motivation for the present study is to provide a framework for the precise
    detection of vole holes that applies sensor, platform, and advanced data processing
    approaches based on machine learning algorithms to monitor and analyze the vole
    population in an agricultural setting. The study is carried out at the landscape
    scale, and focuses on detector accuracy as a function of habitat composition (abundance
    of burrow systems), structural landscape heterogeneity (e.g., crop or soil background),
    and the influence of UAS imagery by comparing the performance of deep object detection
    models on an orthophoto product versus individual/single UAS images. The following
    deep learning-based algorithms are evaluated in this paper: Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3,
    YOLOv5, EfficientNet, and RetinaNet. For each method, a detailed description of
    the model architecture, the parameter settings used for training, and any additional
    stages such as pre-processing, multimodal data, and post-processing, are provided.
    3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Object Detection Models This section presents a
    comprehensive description of the object detection methods used: Faster R-CNN,
    YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and EfficientNet and RetinaNet, in the general flowchart of the
    study (Figure 1). Figure 1. Overall flowchart. Faster R-CNN [41] is a two-stage
    object detection model that generates a sparse set of entrant objects using a
    region pooling network (RPN) based on feature maps and classifies each object
    as foreground or background. After extracting the feature maps with a CNN, a set
    of bounding boxes at the object locations is generated in the first stage via
    an RPN. The size of each anchor is configured using hyperparameters. The region
    of interest pooling layer (RoI pooling) generates sub-feature maps that are converted
    into dimensional vectors and fed forward to fully connected layers. These layers
    are then used as a regression network to predict the bounding box offsets, and
    a classification network is applied to predict the class label for each bounding
    box. The attention network is used to avoid misalignments between the RoI and
    the extracted features of the RoIAlign layer (introduced in Mask R-CNN [41]).
    In this study, Faster R-CNN with a RoIAlign layer is applied within ResNeXt101
    [42], with a feature pyramid network (FPN) [43] feature extraction backbone. FPN
    provides lateral connections that can enhance the semantic characteristics of
    shallow layers via a top-down pathway that promotes generic feature extraction.
    The YOLO family of models [21] are end-to-end deep learning-based detection models
    that determine the bounding boxes of the objects present in the image and classify
    them in a single pass. This approach does not involve region proposal steps, unlike
    two-stage detectors. The YOLO network first splits the input image into a grid
    of non-overlapping cells and predicts three elements for each cell: (i) the probability
    of an object being present; (ii) the coordinates of the box surrounding it (only
    if there is an object in this cell); and (iii) the class to which the object belongs
    and the associated probability. YOLO is an anchor-free algorithm and performs
    regression of the target position and category for each pixel of the feature map.
    The development of YOLOv3 [22] improved the detection accuracy, and in particular
    allowed the model to find objects of different sizes, as it offered three detection
    levels rather than only one in the previous versions, thus supporting the detection
    of smaller objects. YOLOv3 predicts three-box anchors for each cell, detects at
    three different levels with the searching grids, and exploits a deeper backbone
    network (Darknet-53) for feature map extraction. However, since YOLOv3 offers
    a deeper feature extraction network with three-level prediction, it is also slower,
    as one-stage detectors are generally characterized by rather lower accuracy in
    terms of detecting small objects from remote-sensing images [44]. As the detection
    algorithm is required to detect only one type of object, the complexity of the
    problem is reduced when only a single object is under investigation. YOLOv5 is
    a high-precision, real-time detection network with a cross-stage partial network
    (CSPNet) Darknet [45] feature extraction backbone, which reduces the number of
    model parameters, thus not only ensuring the speed and accuracy of inference but
    also reducing the size of the model. YOLOv5 includes four models: the smallest
    is YOLOv5s, with 7.5 million parameters (plain 7 MB, COCO pre-trained 14 MB) and
    140 layers, and the largest is YOLOv5x, with 89 million parameters and 284 layers
    (plain 85 MB, COCO pre-trained 170 MB). In the approach proposed in this study,
    a pre-trained YOLOv5x model is used. This model includes a two-stage detector
    consisting of a CSPNet [45] backbone trained on MS-COCO [20], and a model head
    using a path aggregation network (PANet) [46] for instance segmentation. Each
    bottleneck unit consists of two convolutional layers with 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 filters.
    The backbone incorporates a spatial pyramid pooling network (SSP) [47], which
    allows for dynamically sized input images and is robust against object deformations.
    EfficientNet is an anchor-based [20], efficient target detection algorithm. It
    consists of three parts: (i) a pre-trained backbone network based on ImageNet;
    (ii) BiFPN, which creates top-down and bottom-up feature fusion by adopting a
    weighted feature fusion scheme to obtain semantic information of different sizes
    in the model; and (iii) a classification and detection box prediction network.
    Feature extraction in EfficientNet-B3 is based on the idea that a small number
    of feature map parameters should provide rich information, thus ensuring fast,
    accurate detection. The RetinaNet model consists of three parts: (i) a residual
    network (ResNet) [42], which is used to extract image features; (ii) an FPN for
    feature processing; and (iii) a classification and return sub-network, which is
    used to output the final detection. The number of layers is directly proportional
    to the abstraction degree of feature extraction and adjustable parameters, where
    the higher the number, the better the fitting effect. Since ResNet’s residual
    unit structure adds a connection to the convolution feedforward network, a deeper
    neural network can be trained. After the image has been passed through the deep
    ResNet, the features are first extracted and then fused by the FPN, and finally
    sent to the classification and return sub-network. 3.2. Field Study In this section,
    we present the details of the dataset used in this field study and then describe
    the setup and the standard evaluation metrics. 3.2.1. Dataset Research area: This
    study took place in an alfalfa (Medicago sativa) field (~25 acres) located in
    the Hula Valley in Israel (33.14868 N, 35.60398 E) in (Figure 2). Alfalfa is a
    perennial plant variety that is mainly used for animal feed (e.g., for dairy cows,
    horses, and sheep), and is grown for 2–6 years. During this time, the alfalfa
    is trimmed/harvested monthly between April and October, but because the fields
    are not plowed, the burrows of Levant voles are not destroyed, allowing the numbers
    of rodents and visible burrows to increase. Alfalfa was selected as a crop due
    to many voles and burrows. In this study, the burrows were counted regardless
    its status (active or inactive). Figure 2. Field study area, (a) the general location;
    (b) aerial orthophotograph (photographic scale 1:20,000) of the Alfalfa fields
    (national database delivered by Ofek Aerial Photography LTD published on www.govmap.gov.il,
    accessed on 17 July 2021); (c) UAS-based orthophoto map of a selected area (30
    × 40 m); (d) a selected plot area marked by four rectangle ground targets in the
    corners; (e) the same plot as in c after marking burrows with white Styrofoam
    balls. UAS platform and data collection—A DJI Phantom 4 Pro platform equipped
    with an inbuilt three-axis gimbal-stabilized 20-megapixel camera was used for
    RGB image acquisition. Pix4Dcapture software (Pix4D, Lausanne, Switzerland) was
    used to control the flight and to capture the RGB images using pre-programmed
    flight plans applying a frontal overlap of 90% and an adjusted side overlap (by
    an amount of flight). The image sequences were collected in Pix4Dcapture software
    using the ‘double grid’ option of the autopilot software and perpendicular flight
    lines. Each area of interest (24 × 40 m) was covered by 82–86 single UAS images,
    wherein a total of 26 areas were scanned. The position and orientation parameters
    for the camera were provided by the onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) and
    global positioning system (GPS). To ensure a ground sampling distance (GDS) of
    ~0.82 cm/px, the UAS was flown at an altitude of 30 m. All the above parameters
    were stored in the metadata of the images for later geo-referencing applications.
    Preparation for data collection—A total of 26 plots of size 10 x 10 m were randomly
    selected, each of which contained fixed objects that allowed us to return to the
    same sampling area, to anchor the photogrammetric models, which were marked with
    ropes, and to provide plot ID. Data collection took place on sunny days with no
    clouds. The UAS data were collected during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020,
    from the beginning of July to August each year. Description of vole burrows (Figure
    3)—Entrances to the burrows (described here as holes and/or burrow holes) are
    normally 2.5–7.5 cm in diameter (Figure 4). Voles are social animals and create
    complex burrow systems with numerous entrances. Although the burrow entrances
    are typically oval, some collapse over time, especially once they are abandoned
    or empty after previous control measures, creating irregular shapes. Therefore,
    the proposed detection method should be tolerant to these shapes and slight changes.
    Figure 3. Photo of oval-shaped burrow holes, marked in red rectangles, taken with
    a smartphone camera from a height of 1 m. Figure 4. Photo of a collapsed hole
    with an irregular shape, taken with a UI DJI Phantom 4 Pro camera, from a height
    of 30 m. Validation—Data collection was divided into two stages: (i) photographing
    the plots for the first time; and (ii) photographing the plots for the second
    time, where all the vole burrows were counted and marked (in total 1740 burrows)
    with white Styrofoam balls, which were placed on the top of the burrows. This
    process was done to enable validation at a later stage, and only visible burrows
    were counted and marked (Figure 5), no covered burrows were taken into account.
    Moreover, to assure the exact location of the holes the DGPS was collected and
    marked only if appeared in a model (digital surface model DSM and orthophoto)
    created using Pix4D. Figure 5. External validation test data were collected via
    UAS before (a) and after (b) marking burrows with white Styrofoam balls. The absolute
    vertical and horizontal accuracy of the UAS-based products (DSM and orthophoto)
    was comparable to that of the GPS device (several meters). This could be significantly
    improved using the DGPS system in the field (to cm level). With this in mind,
    a total of 10 ground control points (GCPs) were measured, which were well distributed
    throughout the field and near-visible horizontally and vertically important objects
    (pillars, weather station, etc.) [48]. Processing of UAS imagery—The images were
    processed using the structure from motion (SfM) method [49], implemented in Pix4D
    Mapper Pro (v. 4.3.31), which included all the main steps of this method. An automatic
    image quality module (implemented in MATLAB, using the horizontal and vertical
    components of the Sobel edge filter, and applied before the data were input to
    the SfM workflow) [50] was used to identify and remove all blurry images from
    the data folder [51] before the images were processed. The common workflow for
    dense point cloud generation included posing estimation, image alignment, generation
    of tie points, generation of dense point clouds using dense stereo matching techniques
    such as the semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm [52], and 3D modeling [53]. The
    recommended parameters were used to generate dense point clouds (e.g., the ‘high’
    option for dense point cloud generation) produced high-resolution orthophotos
    and DSMs with a spatial resolution of 1.5 cm. The point density option was set
    to ‘optimal’, and the minimum number of matches was set to three, using a matching
    window of size 9 × 9 pixels. Finally, the geometric accuracies of the generated
    point clouds and DSMs were evaluated separately. The visual features were illustrated
    using quantile-quantile plots [54], elevation profiles, and error classification
    maps [55]. The accuracy of the DSM was 2 cm in the horizontal direction, and <3
    cm in the vertical direction, calculated based on five validation GPS points that
    were measured in the field (using an Emlid ReachRS2 device) but were not used
    in the Pix4D model. In this study, we used the “calibrated camera parameters file”
    and “calibrated external camera parameters” offered by the Pix4D [48]. Thematic
    layers—The DSM was processed further to create two additional inputs for the training
    of the CNN. The first product was a terrain ruggedness index (TRI) [50,56,57],
    which represents the mean of the absolute differences in height between a focal
    cell and its 3 × 3 neighboring cubes (ca. 4.5 cm3) and quantifies the total change.
    Smooth surfaces have a value of zero, while rough surfaces have positive values.
    This simple index was used as a normalization factor in further analysis, as it
    could categorize each surface using a simple scoring system (positive values).
    Next, we calculated the texture, which is a descriptive property of all the surfaces
    and contains information regarding the structural arrangement of features and
    the relationship with their surroundings. Our main approach to the quantification
    of scene texture involved computation using a moving window with two-dimensional
    (2D) surface roughness as an input. Please note that in the processing stage,
    the point cloud was extracted using a 3D gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM).
    The 2D GLCM is a matrix, where each input datum has a gray level [58] examining
    the spatial relationship of objects. The 3D GLCM is used to determine the distance
    and direction before the pixel pairs are counted, whereas for the 2D GLCM, only
    horizontal distances and directions are determined before counting, and vertical
    distances are computed during the counting process. The specific generation process
    used in 3D GLCM [59] involves the following steps: (i) fix the image window size
    for a pixel and the level of intensity; (ii) define the horizontal distance and
    direction; (iii) split the vertical direction into sections, and prepare the same
    number of matrices; (iv) in the fixed window, find all pixel pairs that satisfy
    the condition in (ii); (v) compute the vertical direction for each pixel pair
    in (iii), meaning that each pixel pair will be counted in the corresponding matrix
    based on its vertical direction; (vi) generate the GLCM by counting in the same
    planar direction but in different vertical directions; (vii) compute Haralick
    features [60] to quantitatively describe the GLCM. Evaluation metrics (Table 1)—The
    following four metrics were used to evaluate the classification model: precision,
    recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP). These are defined based on
    four quantities: true positive (TP), which indicates that the predicted and actual
    values are both positive; false positive (FP), which means that the predicted
    value is positive, but the actual forecast is negative; false negative (FN), which
    means that the actual value is positive but the predicted value is negative; true
    negative (TN), which means that the predicted and actual values are both negative.
    Table 1. Evaluation metrics. The intersection over union (IoU) measures the overlap
    ratio between the detected object (marked by a bounding box) and the ground truth
    (an annotated bounding box that is not included in the training dataset). The
    value of IoU varies between zero (no overlap) and one (total overlap) and is used
    to determine whether the detected object is a real object (according to a given
    threshold). The threshold in this study was very low (0.1), due to our interest
    in small objects. The mean average precision (mAP) is defined as the integral
    of the precision over the recall interval [0, 1], i.e., the area under the precision-recall
    curve [61]. 3.2.2. Training The infrastructure used for training was a single
    NVIDIA® V10017 tensor core graphical processing unit (GPU) with 16 GB memory,
    as part of an NVIDIA® DGX-118 supercomputer for deep learning. Faster R-CNN was
    pre-trained on MS-COCO [20] with a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with
    a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay set to 0.0001. The learning rate was 0.01
    in the first 500 iterations and then multiplied by 0.1 at epochs 10, 30, and 100.
    The training of YOLO has been carried out in two stages: an initial training phase
    and a self-training phase. The initial stage used the original training data to
    train the model, while the self-training stage, also called pseudo-labeling, extended
    the available training data by inferring detections for images for which no original
    annotation data were available [62]. This was realized using the model resulting
    from the initial training stage, and the generated detections were then used as
    pseudo-annotated data. Cross-validation was performed to approximate training
    optima using a default set of hyperparameters performed in the single-class training
    mode. In the initial training stage, a base model was trained on the training
    dataset for 100 epochs with a batch size of 30. This base model was initialized
    with weights from the pre-trained MS-COCO model. In the self-training phase, the
    base model was used to create an extended training dataset. Pseudo-annotation
    data were inferred for the validation and test datasets using the best-performing
    epoch (which was automatically saved by the model). At this stage, the base model
    training was resumed from its latest epoch and was trained further on the extended
    training dataset with a batch size of 10. The EfficientNet and RetinaNet models
    were trained on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPU with a batch size of 16, a stochastic
    gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00005, a momentum of 0.9,
    and 50 epochs. Each image obtained by the UAS was manually annotated by drawing
    rectangles to surround each object. A total of 6100 images of burrows were manually
    annotated for the training and test datasets, from which 4200 training samples
    and 1900 test samples were produced (~70% training, ~30% test). Furthermore, in
    total 1740 images were divided into two (~50–50%) groups (Figure 6) labeled background
    1 (bare soil) and background 2 (ground cover) and used as an external validation
    (test sites). Figure 6. Examples of holes with bare soil background (a) and ground
    cover (b). 4. Results Table 2 and Table 3 show the results of the internal test
    for 30% of the input data (1900 test samples out of 6100 images in total) from
    various algorithms, focusing specifically on the detection rate for an orthophoto
    versus a single UAS image. Table 2 lists the training results for each method
    for a single UAS image. In terms of precision, recall, mAP, and F1-score, the
    performance of the self-trained YOLOv3 model was superior to the other six methods.
    Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, YOLOv5 (self-trained and initially trained) and EfficientNet
    achieved lower results (mAP = 32%, 58%, 60%, 61% and 66%) than the general YOLOv3
    model (mAP = 72%), and the self-trained YOLOv3 model (mAP = 82%). The results
    in Table 2 also confirm the good performance of YOLOv3 in terms of recall/precision
    balance. The best F1-score of 0.93 was achieved by the self-trained YOLOv3 model;
    this was significantly higher than the values for the other detectors, such as
    EfficientNet (0.80) and YOLOv5 self-training (0.76), RetinaNet (0.75), and Faster
    R-CNN (0.52). Table 2. Overall training evaluation metrics (best result in bold)
    for a single UAS image for 30% of the input data (1900 test samples out of 6100
    images in total). Table 3. Overall training evaluation metrics (best result in
    bold) for an orthophoto product for 30% of the input data (1900 test samples out
    of 6100 images in total). Table 3 presents the training results for each examined
    method for the orthophoto products. In terms of precision, recall, mAP, and F1
    score, once again the performance of the self-trained YOLOv3 were superior to
    those of the other six methods, with a mAP of 0.81 and an F1-score of 84%, while
    the worst results were obtained by Faster R-CNN with a mAP of 0.33 and an F1-score
    of 52%. Based on the results in Table 2 and Table 3, the following observations
    can be made: (i) the YOLOv3 models achieved better performance than the other
    models, thus demonstrating the advantage of the small target detector; (ii) the
    self-training model is beneficial to both YOLOv3 (the F1-score improved from 84%
    to 91% for a single UAS image product and 83% to 84% for an orthophoto product)
    and YOLOv5 (the F1-score improved from 76% to 78% for a single UAS image product
    and from 70% to 72% for an orthophoto product); and (iii) from a global perspective,
    the training results for all detectors were better for the single UAS image, as
    all detectors achieved lower performance for the orthophoto product. Table 4 shows
    the effect of using DSM-related layers (with multimodal data as input). Following
    the approach suggested by Brook and Stober-Zisu (2020) for textural analysis,
    three thematic/textural maps calculated using 3D GLCM were tested based on homogeneity,
    entropy, and correlation. The multimodal dataset with three layers at once allowed
    us to train all the suggested models with the following input combinations: Dataset
    1: grayscale orthophoto product, TRI (roughness), and a homogeneity layer (3D
    GLCM textural maps); Dataset 2: grayscale orthophoto product, TRI (roughness)
    layer and a correlation layer (3D GLCM textural maps); Dataset 3: grayscale orthophoto
    product, TRI (roughness) layer and an entropy layer (3D GLCM textural maps). Table
    4. Overall training evaluation metrics (best result in bold) on multimodal datasets
    for an orthophoto product for 30% of the input data (1900 test samples out of
    6100 images in total). Compared with the original orthophoto training results
    (in Table 3), the multimodal input datasets achieved better results with Dataset
    3. The results in Table 4 show that the self-training YOLOv3 fed with Dataset
    3 achieved a mAP of 0.86 and an F1-score of ~94%, values that were significantly
    higher than those reported for a single UAS imagery product (Table 2). Effects
    of Different Backgrounds in the Validation Sets The detection of small objects
    with various agricultural backgrounds is a key challenge in many remote-sensing
    applications. To improve prediction accuracy, the training data should be captured
    in various environments so that the network can distinguish between the object
    of interest and background targets. An alternative approach is a model that can
    generalize the characteristics of the scene without prior knowledge regardless
    of their background/environment. The main aim here was to evaluate the ability
    of the initially trained and self-trained YOLOv3 model to handle a range of agricultural
    backgrounds. Two external validation areas (1740 samples in total) with new backgrounds
    (bare soil and groundcover backgrounds) were selected. Table 5 presents the results
    for all the products (i.e., a single UAS image, orthophoto, and multimodal dataset)
    on two different validation sets. Table 5. Overall external test evaluation metrics
    (best result in bold) on all available datasets for two validation sets (1740
    samples in total). As shown in Table 5, the self-trained YOLOv3 achieved better
    results for all input datasets (as shown in bold) on the first validation set
    (bare soil) than for the second (groundcover). This can be explained by the level
    of similarity between the backgrounds in the validation set and the training set.
    The groundcover (training set) was more similar to the bare soil (validation set
    1) than to the groundcover (validation set 2). When comparing the results with
    those reported in Table 4, where the self-trained YOLOv3 achieved a mAP of 0.86
    for the multimodal dataset, the performance for unseen backgrounds in the validation
    set was lower (i.e., in 3% for the bare soil and 8% for the groundcover background).
    Compared to the other input datasets, this model achieved the best performance
    (i.e., 6% on the first background and 12% on the second background for the orthophoto
    product and 8% on the first background, and 9% on the second background for a
    single UAS image). In (Figure 7) three examples of detection level for the external
    test sites are presented in subsets. In Figure 7a the reported results achieved
    the best level of detection with F1-score of 100%, in b the detection level is
    lower ~87% and in c the detection level is very low 33%. These results representing
    the best, moderate, and worst results of the model. Figure 7. Selected examples
    of detection level for the external test sites, (a) the best; (b) the moderate;
    and (c) the worst, results of the model. The multimodal dataset (i.e., grayscale
    orthophoto product, TRI roughness index layer, and the entropy layer calculated
    via 3D GLCM textural information) produced the most accurate results. However,
    comparing between orthophoto product and single UAS image data, the results in
    Table 2 and Table 3 show that a single UAS image product is advantageous, as it
    was able to detect vole burrows better than an orthophoto product. This may be
    due to the spatial resolution and to the spatial/geometrical artifacts and general
    smoothness, particularly at the edges, produced by the triangulation/interpolation
    processes in the photogrammetric program. However, the multimodal dataset that
    included the orthophoto product and was supported using two physical surface properties
    (i.e., the roughness and texture randomness, calculated as surface entropy) derived
    from the DSM model yielded the best results. These findings illustrate the effectiveness
    and influence of multimodal datasets on machine learning and the rate of detection
    of small objects from low-cost UAS-based sensors. 5. Discussion The detection
    of small objects with various agricultural backgrounds is a key challenge in many
    remote-sensing applications. Several methods and deep learning algorithms can
    be addressed to detect objects, but not all of them can accurately detect small
    objects, especially objects with various agricultural backgrounds [63] in UAS-based
    remote-sensing imagery. On an operational level, the best time to collect the
    field data and capture detailed information is immediately after the harvest,
    before the groundcover or small weeds start growing around the burrows and change
    the background. This is a preferable time window to assure significantly easier
    and more accurate target detection. Indeed, an important influencing factor in
    the practical applications of remote-sensing means for small object detection
    is reclined on testing different types of input datasets. In this study were tested
    three different input datasets were: (i) single UAS images, (ii) orthophotos,
    (iii) multimodal dataset (combining textural physical layers with orthophoto data),
    on one- and two-stage algorithms such as YOLOv3 and Faster-RCNN respectively.
    The YOLO v3 algorithm achieved better results than other examined methods. Evaluated
    by metrics of precision, recall, mAP, and F1-score, the performance of the self-trained
    YOLOv3 model was superior to the other six methods (Table 2, Table 3 and Table
    4). This model demonstrated an excellent ability of a one-stage algorithm to detect
    small (vary in shape) targets in a complex agricultural background. The self-training
    model was beneficial to both YOLOv3 (the F1-score improved from 84% to 91% for
    a single UAS image product and 83% to 84% for an orthophoto product) and YOLOv5
    (the F1-score improved from 76% to 78% for a single UAS image product and from
    70% to 72% for an orthophoto product). The training results for all detectors
    were better for the single UAS image, as all detectors achieved lower performance
    for the orthophoto product (Table 2 and Table 3). On the other hand, research
    that tested the capability of YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 for apple picking robot [64],
    concluded that the average time for one apple detection is about 19 ms for YOLOv3.
    Both speed and error fractions were less than in all known similar applications.
    YOLOv5 in this type of application, detected apples precisely without any additional
    techniques [64]. Numerous studies searched for a reason causing small object miss-detection
    and false detection [65]. Several studies compare YOLOv5 and YOLOv3, but only
    after improving the initial anchor box size of the original YOLOv5network to avoid
    misrecognition of small objects [66]. However, in our study, the targets are small
    and probably not in contrast to YOLOv5, therefore this model could not outperform
    the 3rd version of YOLO. In addition, the average detection speeds per orthophoto
    (field area of 24 × 40 m with 1.5 spatial resolution) is ~50 times longer than
    the detection process time for a single UAS image [67]. This fact is important
    for practical applications and should be taken into account in the case of emergency
    or under a normal agriculture schedule that every action should be on time. The
    main benefit of a single UAS image detector based on YOLOv3 is its computational
    time. The external test dataset reported the following detection speed: (i) a
    single UAS image was processed around 0.05 s, which was very fast compared to
    orthophoto or multimodal inputs (execution time); (ii) a single orthophoto was
    processed around 3 min; and (iii) multimodal was processed around 3.5 min, this
    calculation is not considering the data preparation time, i.e., Pix4D Mapper,
    3D GLCM, etc. The multimodal input datasets achieved the best results with the
    grayscale orthophoto product, TRI (roughness) layer, and an entropy layer (3D
    GLCM textural maps) dataset (Table 4) for the self-training YOLOv3 model (mAP
    of 0.86 and an F1-score of ~94%). Its results were significantly higher than those
    reported for both multimodal grayscale datasets and higher than a single UAS imagery
    dataset. Image texture and physical layers provided valuable information on the
    spatial arrangement, and together with shade (in our case grayscale) or intensities
    were selected as the most informative and suitable input dataset, similarly to
    studies [68] reporting on the advantages of multimodal for small object detection.
    To improve prediction accuracy and more importantly to support a real-world application,
    the model should be able to operate under various environments so that the network
    can distinguish between the object of interest and background [69]. Our original
    hypothesis that “the target objects on the bare soil backgrounds will be easier
    to detect” has been tested. Indeed, according to Table 5, the self-trained YOLOv3
    achieved better results for all input datasets on the first validation set (bare
    soil) than for the second (groundcover). This can be explained by the level of
    similarity between the backgrounds in the validation set and the training set.
    The groundcover (training set) was more similar to the bare soil (external test—validation
    set 1) than to the groundcover (external test—validation set 2). When comparing
    the results with those reported in Table 4, where the self-trained YOLOv3 achieved
    a mAP of 0.86 for the multimodal dataset, the performance for unseen backgrounds
    in the validation set was lower (i.e., in 3% for the bare soil and 8% for the
    groundcover background). Compared to the other input datasets, this model achieved
    the best performance (i.e., 6% on the bare soil background and 12% on the groundcover
    background for the orthophoto product and 8% on the first background, and 9% on
    the second background for a single UAS image). 6. Conclusions One and two-stage
    detector models usable to detect small targets in agricultural backgrounds, from
    different input datasets, have been examined to identify an environmentally efficient
    method of rodent control to support the achievement of SDG2 and to promote sustainable
    agriculture. The focus of this study was on evaluating the performance of the
    suggested models on a single UAS-based image, a UAS-based orthophoto product processed
    with the Pix4D mapper photogrammetric program, and a multimodal product for agriculture/environmental
    applications. The contribution of the multimodal dataset to small object detection
    was assessed and reported. A study and analysis of a field-scale (real-world)
    UAS dataset using Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv5, EfficientNet, and RetinaNet showed
    that the highest mAP value and F1-score were achieved by the self-trained YOLOv3
    on multimodal data. The validation results demonstrated the superiority and practicality
    of the multimodal dataset. The main conclusions of this work are as follows: Superior
    results were obtained from high spatial resolution edge/contrast-preserving data
    (single UAS-based imagery) than from an orthophoto produced by a photogrammetry
    program. These data showed a relatively high detection rate of vole burrows (small
    targets), but this method is not efficient at the field scale. Although its performance
    was poorer, the orthophoto also showed potential as a detection method. The use
    of physical/texture information showed great promise in terms of the detection
    of vole burrows from a multimodal dataset, and achieved higher prediction accuracy
    when all the spatial and physical features were included. Multimodal data yielded
    superior performance in the detection of vole burrows compared to single UAS image
    data, for all modeling methods. A self-trained multimodal YOLOv3 model outperformed
    the other methods and exhibited strong adaptability to different datasets with
    high detection accuracy, along with robustness in terms of spatial dependency
    and variation. Author Contributions Data collection, H.E., M.C.; Analysis, H.E.,

  description: 'Unmanned aerial systems can widely be expected to realize the demand
    for "machine for man" in the field of precision agriculture. Particularly, the
    workforce is aging in most industrial countries, together with ever-increasing
    consumption, unreasonable exploitation of resources, and gradually deteriorated
    ecological environment. Correspondingly, these issues have posed a great challenge
    to sustainable agriculture in the future, as rapid information technology (IT)
    is emerging. Nevertheless, current farmland is distributed mainly on a small to
    medium scale after decades of land use regulation. By contrast, modern agricultural
    production requires a large scale, precision, and low cost in the direction of
    automation. Furthermore, most advanced technologies generally present relatively
    high cost, complex composition, and limited application, such as satellite, visual,
    and radar navigation. Therefore, it is highly necessary to explore a detection
    system with low-cost, high-precision, and easy-to-use navigation parameters. Fortunately,
    ultra-wideband communication (UWB) has received extensive attention in the field
    of wireless communication transmission in recent years. UWB-based positioning
    is one of the most promising high-precision technologies, providing convenience
    and new ideas for autonomous navigation in agriculture and industry. An important
    new initiative is also currently to vigorously promote land rectification and
    construction of high-standard farmland at this stage of agricultural production
    in China. This scheme has laid a solid foundation to realizing autonomous navigation
    for large-field agricultural machinery in the agronomic aspects. However, the
    current national large-field agriculture is still dominated by the individual
    management system and the family joint production contract responsibility system.
    Specifically, 90% of large-field agriculture is characterized by regional production
    on a small scale. Fragmented distribution is still the main body with a concentrated
    planting pattern of small fields at the 100-metre level, especially in the southern
    paddy fields. At present, there are two types of UWB positioning: short-range
    and long-range. The long-range module can reach more than 300m, up to 1 200 m,
    and the optimal positioning accuracy can be known within 5cm. It indicates that
    the long-range UWB wireless range sensor can meet the demand for autonomous navigation
    and the driving of farm machinery in large fields in terms of range and detection
    accuracy. Furthermore, there is also local, moderately small-scale and scattered
    production, particularly on the large-field cultivation patterns in the southern
    paddy fields of China. The main factors are confined to the development of satellite,
    visual and radar navigation, including the high investment, complicated structure,
    limited applicable environment, and susceptibility to environmental interference.
    In this study, an improved signal angle of arrival (AOA) model was proposed to
    detect the navigation parameters under the reciprocal operation patterns of agricultural
    machinery in an unmanned environment in a large field. The UWB-based station tag
    was adopted as the detection sensor. Two arrangements were also designed to achieve
    fast and accurate detection of navigation parameters during the unmanned operation
    of agricultural machinery, including the double base station-body longitudinal
    double tag (TBZ) and double base station-body transverse double tag (TBH). The
    static test results show that the detection accuracy of navigation parameters
    improved significantly for the TBZ and TBH arrangements, as the tag or base station
    spacing increased. Specifically, the detection error of lateral deviation was
    ≤8 cm, and the heading deviation tended to be close to 0, but not greater than
    1°. An orthogonal test was combined with the analysis of variance (ANOVA), thereby
    clarifying the significance of key parameters in the TBZ and TBH arrangements
    on the detection of lateral and heading deviation, and finally to determine the
    main and secondary factors for the optimal combination of parameters. The dynamic
    test results show that the detection accuracy of lateral and heading deviation
    decreased significantly, as the speed of the vehicle increased, where the error
    of lateral deviation was below 10 cm and the error of heading deviation was less
    than 3°, and the coefficient of variation was less than 10%. The finding can provide
    a sound reference for the development of unmanned systems with low cost, high
    precision, easy operation in modern mechanized agriculture.'

    Wide Band）基站-标签作为检测传感器，设计了TBZ（田边双基站-车身纵向双标签）和TBH（田边双基站-车身横向双标签）2种传感器布置方式，实现农业机械无人驾驶过程中导航参数的快速精准检测。静态试验结果表明：对于2种传感器布置方式，在固定的基站间距和标签间距下，随着标签间距或基站间距的增大导航参数检测精度均有所提高，横向偏差检测误差≤8
    cm，航向偏差趋近于0，但不大于1°，并通过正交组合试验方差分析明确了2种传感器布置方式的关键参数对横向偏差和航向偏差检测精度影响的显著性，确定了主次因素和较优参数组合。动态试验结果表明：随着车速增大，横向偏差和航向偏差的检测精度有所降低，横向偏差误差均不超过10
    cm，航向偏差的检测误差均小于3°，变异系数均小于10%，说明动态环境下自主导航参数检测系统仍具有较高的检测精度，可满足农机大田自主导航作业需求。研究结果可为研制低成本、高精度和便捷的无人驾驶系统提供参考。

  description: Timely and reliable information about crop management, production,
    and yield is consid-ered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and
    international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety
    and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates,
    around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the
    demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies
    like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The
    application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable
    agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology
    with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites
    and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the
    5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications,
    through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched
    by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing
    the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher
    spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor
    technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming
    for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant
    value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting
    and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing.
    The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation
    of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby
    augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability.
    These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation
    of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible.
    Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are
    discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics,

    innovation has made it possible that 2021 has been officially marked by the European
    Commission as the beginning of the era of “Industry 5.0” [1]. The industrial world,
    including the agricultural sector, is starting this year by getting a bit closer
    to digitalized and automated systems. Although, agriculture began in the Copper
    Age, after the Neolithic period, when man started cultivation by making use of
    wooden instruments and domesticating animals, this was then revolutionized through
    the use of metallic equipment for crop cultivation and this time was categorized
    as the first and second agricultural revolutions. The third and fourth industrial
    revolutions brought robotics, machines, telecommunication systems, genetic decoding,
    etc., to agriculture. The fifth and current revolution is based on artificial
    intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, applied to agricultural remote sensing
    (RS). A simple illustration of all the principal industrial revolutions, with
    respect to agriculture, is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. An illustration of
    industrial revolutions, with respect to agriculture, over time. Representative
    events/technologies are mentioned in each respective technological era, although
    they are not limited to only these. The increasing world population, climate change,
    and sustainable development goals require the agriculture sector to be efficient
    and sustainable: thereby ensuring food safety and security. According to the Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO), current agricultural production must increase
    by 70 % by 2050 considering the increasing demand for high quality and environmentally
    friendly food [2]. Similarly, on 25 September, 2015, the United Nations (UN) general
    assembly approved the agenda “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
    Development”, which is an action plan for the prosperity of people and the planet
    [3]. Under this agenda, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were embodied,
    replacing the previously established Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with
    a timeframe of completion from 2015 to 2030. Out of these 17 SDGs, the second
    SDG is “zero hunger”, i.e., eradicating the hunger, as it was estimated that,
    in 2015, around 690 million people were suffering from hunger [3,4]. This situation
    has worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic by affecting food transport systems and
    threatening people’s access to food due to the associated loss of income or increased
    food prices. In this context, FAO considers that agriculture can contribute to
    achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG-2, by providing healthy food that is directly
    related to better health and a productive life. The aims of SDG-2, to eliminate
    hunger and ensure access for all people, particularly the poor and in vulnerable
    situations, including infants, to healthy, nutritious, and sufficient food all
    year round (goal 2.1: SDG-2), are very ambitious. Nevertheless, agriculture has
    the potential to fulfil these objectives by enhancing the income of small-scale
    farmers (goal 2.2: SDG-2), strengthening the capacity to combat climate change,
    extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, fires, floods and other disasters), and
    progressively improving soil and land quality (goal 2.4: SDG-2). However, in order
    to do all of the above, a change is required in the way in which all stakeholders
    in the agri-food ecosystem approach the production process. The first and perhaps
    the most important step towards this goal is to change the way decisions are made
    at all levels of agricultural production, from the most primary level of the farmer
    who is called upon to make decisions every day on his cultivation to the agronomists
    and decision makers in large agri-food enterprises. Storage and analyses of large
    volumes of data (big data) for predictions (e.g., production or spread of diseases)
    but also for the possibility for agri-food companies to produce, from the data
    collected by digitization of production, information that is relevant to the value
    of their products and services. Therefore, a promising technology like RS can
    be an efficient tool to support agricultural sustainability. As an example, having
    RS as a novel tool to face adversities in agriculture, especially in developing
    countries, will produce positive effects in the global economy (maintaining the
    cost of agricultural products), will reduce the scale of economic emigration (often
    due to one or several years of low crop yield), and will help distribute richness
    more evenly across the planet [5,6]. In this 5th industrial revolution, RS has
    the potential of being one of the most important technologies for today’s agriculture.
    This is why RS, in the context of “agriculture 5.0”, is discussed in this article.
    RS sprouted in the 19th century (specifically in 1858) through the use of air
    balloons for aerial observations [7]. At present, it occupies a central position
    in precision agriculture (PA) and soil studies. It is also important to mention
    some of the interchangeable terms most commonly used include “precision farming”,
    “precision approach”, “remote sensing”, “digital farming”, “information intensive
    agriculture”, “smart agriculture”, “variable rate technology (VRT)”, “global navigation
    satellite system (GNSS) agriculture”, “farming by inch”, “site specific crop management”,
    “digital agriculture”, “agriculture 5.0”, etc. RS is a vast term that covers various
    technological systems, such as satellites, RPAs, GNSS, geographic information
    systems (GIS), big data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of
    Everything (IoE), cloud computing, wireless sensors technologies (WST), decision
    support systems (DSS), and autonomous robots. A remarkable breakthrough in RS
    technology occurred approximately fifty years ago with the advent, and later with
    launch, of Landsat-1 in 1972 [8]. Given the importance of such technologies, a
    rapid increase in investigations in the agricultural domain has been witnessed
    in terms of the number of publications. For example, in the last five years (2015–2019)
    the highest number of publications regarding the use of RPAs in agriculture belonged
    to Europe at 34%, followed by United States and China at 20% and 11%, respectively
    [6]. Primary work on RS has mainly been focused on the reflection mechanism, absorption,
    and diffusion of light rays from plant leaves, which differ based on the leaf
    thickness, structure, and pigment content of plant species [9]. Nevertheless,
    during the last decade, the scenario has changed and RS technology has been entirely
    revolutionized. Current studies are more related to designing novel algorithms,
    improving sensor technology, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence.
    In addition, agricultural RS is now experiencing a shift from structural parameter
    monitoring to functional trait monitoring, e.g., nitrogen contents, foliar and
    canopy functional traits, pigments, etc. For example, a profound characterization
    of spatiotemporal variability of chlorophyll a and b contents has been recently
    undertaken [10]. The “SmartAgro” project is a Romanian national project with the
    aim of developing a self-diagnosing and self-configuring telemetry system, enabling
    the use of IoT for areas with limited global system for mobile communication (GSM)
    signals [11], and is an example of improving the potential of RS by filling in
    research gaps. Similarly, various projects by the European Union (EU), such as
    “VIRTUOUS”, “NEWBIE”, “SWAMP”, etc., are also oriented to strengthen modern precision
    agriculture by utilizing state-of-the-art computational technologies [12,13,14].
    In the same way, the creation of new AI-enabled software and applications is underway,
    which can verbally communicate with users and receive commands, e.g., AgroHub
    [15]. Quite a number of review articles, with respect to RS, are also available
    now—discussing or comparing particular aspects of these novel technologies. For
    example, a few of the reported studies, just in past three years (2018–2020),
    have discussed topics like plant biodiversity, monitoring of a particular crop,
    highlighting various applications, discussing substantial improvements to different
    platforms or technologies, use of particular technology, weed management, data
    management, underlining limitations, and hinting towards opportunities in this
    field [7,11,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40].
    Such a huge number of publications emphasize the tenacious necessity of using
    RS technologies in agriculture. Similarly, this increasing number of studies also
    depicts the significant progress of RS technology in the agricultural sector.
    The persistent need for food safety and security [9] is a driving factor for the
    incorporation of RS technologies into farms. Furthermore, the restriction of free
    movement and transport due to the current COVID-19 pandemic are impeding agricultural
    growth, which necessitates the implementation of RS technology for a better, economical,
    secure, efficient, and profitable industry. Therefore, the scope of this article
    is, not only to incite future research in this sphere, but also to highlight the
    importance of RS in ensuring food safety and security given the rapidly increasing
    world population. Similarly, the potential of RS to ensure sustainable agriculture
    is also described with its respective products. Correspondingly, research gaps
    are emphasized, based on the current status of these technologies, along with
    possible opportunities and the enabling technologies of this era. This work has
    four sections. The first section highlights the prominent features of RS technology
    (i.e., RS technology products, data retrieving approaches, most commonly used
    vegetation indices, and spectral bands) and identifies current research efforts.
    The second section indicates the potential and applications of artificial intelligence
    to complement RS technology with respect to the 5th industrial revolution. In
    this regard, research gaps and challenges are also discussed. The third section
    deals with sensors used in RS; novel technologies and opportunities that this
    new technological era offers are also discussed. Similarly, the most common platforms
    of RS technology (i.e., satellites and RPAs) with practical examples in agriculture
    are presented in this section. Finally, the fourth section highpoints the research
    gaps and future potentials of RS technology, with examples, where possible, for
    guaranteeing agricultural sustainability and making the best use of the 5th industrial
    revolution. 2. Agricultural Remote Sensing Agricultural remote sensing is a very
    useful technology that allows us to observe crops on a large scale in a synoptic,
    remote, and non-destructive manner. Usually, it involves a sensor mounted on a
    platform, which could be a satellite, RPA, unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), or
    a field robot. The sensor collects the reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation
    from plants, which is then further processed to produce useful information and
    products. This information consists of traits of the agriculture system and their
    variations in space and time. Functional traits have been defined as the biochemical,
    morphological, phenological, physiological, and structural physiognomies that
    regulate organism (plant) performance or fitness [18]. These traits vary from
    one plant to another and from one location to other, and can be categorized as
    typological-, biological-, physical-, structural-, geometrical-, or chemical-based
    in terms of their respective natures. RS provides an effective relation between
    the radiance of plants and the respective traits to extract useful information,
    e.g., leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, soil moisture content, etc.
    Nevertheless, a number of factors, like the crop phenological stage, crop type,
    soil type, location, wind speed, precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, nutrient
    supply, etc., need to be known to generate accurate information from RS products.
    Among others, plant density, organ computing, LAI, green cover fraction, leaf
    biochemical content, leaf orientation, height, soil and vegetation temperature,
    and soil moisture are prominent informational products that RS delivers. This
    information is further processed and used to interpret crop health, disease infraction,
    irrigation period, nutrient deficiency, and yield estimations. Weiss et al. [18]
    categorized agricultural data retrieving approaches from RS into the following
    three principal categories: Purely empirical methods: establishing a direct relationship
    between a measured RS signal and biophysical variables (linear and nonlinear regressions:
    machine learning). Mechanistic methods: model inversion based on Maxwell’s equations
    (for radar interferometry and polarimetry), optical and projective geometry (for
    LiDAR and photogrammetry), and radiative transfer theory (for solar and microwave
    domains). Contextual methods: processing the spatial and temporal characteristics
    of captured images using segmentation techniques. Another way to describe information
    treatment using RS technology is the preparation of vegetation indices (VIs).
    Most commonly, VIs calculated using RS, among others, include: normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) for crop monitoring and empirical studies; soil-adjusted
    vegetation index (SAVI) for improving the sensitivity of NDVI to soil backgrounds;
    green normalized difference vegetation index (gNDVI) for estimating the photosynthetic
    activity; wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) for enhancing the dynamic
    range of NDVI; chlorophyll index–green (CI–G) for determining the leaf chlorophyll
    content; modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) for reducing the influence
    of bare soil on SAVI; optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) for calculating
    aboveground biomass, leaf nitrogen content, and chlorophyll content; chlorophyll
    vegetation index (CVI) for representing relative abundance of vegetation and soil;
    triangular vegetation index (TVI) for predicting leaf nitrogen status; normalized
    green red difference index (NGRDI) for estimating nutrient status; visible atmospherically
    resistant index (VARI) for mitigating the illuminating differences and atmospheric
    effects in the visible spectrum; crop water stress index (CWSI) for measuring
    canopy temperature changes and dynamics; and photochemical reflectance index (PRI)
    for detecting disease symptoms [7]. Normally sensors used in RS that are for crop
    monitoring detect the following electromagnetic wave bands, depending on specific
    objectives [7]: Thermal infrared band; Red, green, and blue (RGB) bands; Near
    infrared (NIR) band; Red edge band (RE). The amplitude of the information retrieved
    from RS is considerable to support sustainable agriculture capable of feeding
    a rapidly growing world population. Among the prominent advantages or applications
    of RS are the identification of phenotypically better varieties, optimization
    of crop management, evapotranspiration, agriculture phenology, crop production
    forecasting, ecosystem services (related to soil or water resources) provision,
    plant and animal biodiversity screening, crop and land monitoring, and precision
    farming [8,18,19,40,41,42]. 3. Artificial Intelligence and RS In this new era
    of computing, the pace of technological advancement is reaching peaks as it never
    has before. Artificial intelligence (AI) has vast potential in the agricultural
    field, although it has not been fully explored in this sphere and is still in
    its infancy. One of the subsets of AI is machine learning, which is used for operating
    definite tasks using a computer system [43] and is generally divided into supervised
    and unsupervised learning techniques. Similarly, neural networks, another basic
    pillar of AI, provide the basis for deep learning algorithms by recognizing patterns
    [44]. Although deep neural network (DNN) became famous in 2016, due to engineering
    complexities they are not very popular today. Instead, convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures are becoming more popular
    and their application can be found in object detection, classification, segmentation,
    etc. [28]. It has been previously reported that machine and deep learning techniques
    are playing pivotal roles in the following three main domains of RS [10]: Classification
    problems [45,46]; Model emulators development [47,48]; Complex empirical relationships
    [49,50]. Nonetheless, there is plenty of room to make the best use of these techniques
    that has not previously been undertaken. For example, Weiss et al. [18] reported
    that despite the potential to account for contextual information in space and
    time based on historical series, machine learning has been mainly exploited to
    estimate variables at the pixel and instantaneous level. Likewise, it is also
    important to consider the limitations of artificial intelligence tools applied
    to agricultural RS through the construction of training databases. The machine
    learning algorithms, describing the relation of causality between inputs and outputs,
    often cannot solidify the full complexity of a diverse relationship due to oversimplifications
    in reality [18,40]. Such limitations need to be resolved. The 5th industrial revolution
    is expected to address the challenges faced in RS to enhance the proficiency and
    productivity. One of the most important areas in agricultural RS is plant stress
    detection. In this regard, image classification is the foremost area of deep learning
    application and gives a diagnostic decision (healthy or diseased) based on the
    input (one or two related images). For example, A CNN was used to detect and classify
    individual lesions and spots on a plant leaf, allowing to identify multiple diseases
    on the same leaf [51]. Researchers reported an increased accuracy of 12% compared
    to previously reported methods, which was over 75% overall. Similar applications
    to stress (biotic and abiotic) classification using AI principles have been reported
    using deep learning principles in apple, cassava, wheat, maize, tomato, soybean,
    grapevine, coffee, and rice [51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67].
    In the same way, various studies on segmentation and object detection, subsets
    of deep learning, include studies on cucumber diseases [68], fruit crop diseases
    [69], rice leaf diseases [70], cucumber leaf disease [71], tomato diseases and
    pests [57], grapevine esca disease [61], maize disease [72], strawberry disease
    [73], and sweet pepper disease [74]. Likewise, AI methods have been implied in
    diverse agricultural contexts, including high-throughput phenotyping [5], yield
    prediction [75], fruit detection [76], weed detection [77], and biomass studies
    [78]. Crops undergo a continuous change in their physiological characteristics
    over their lifecycles, and these physiological changes are greatly affected by
    stress (biotic or abiotic). AI is paving the way to make detection and identification
    processes of plant diseases faster, among other RS applications, but it is only
    based on obtained images, which hinders earlier detection of disease. Similarly,
    most of the commercial hyperspectral imaging sensors used in RS platforms can
    only work optimally under laboratory conditions. The other challenge is a lack
    of datasets for deep learning-assisted applications. Another commonly associated
    product of RS technology in relation to AI is the decision support systems (DSS).
    Therefore, it would be important to highlight the potential and roles of DSS in
    agricultural RS. Decision Support Systems (DSS) Agricultural decision support
    systems (DSS) can simply be identified as the informative resources that facilitate
    farmers in their decision making, based on knowledge of various crop-growth parameters
    [79]. DSS involves data collection, organization, and analysis to provide either
    short-term or long-term decisions. For example, for pest or weed control, DSS
    can establish a list of prospective fertilizers to use, or even suggest integration
    of both chemical and non-chemical-based practices, based on the crop type, growth
    stage, etc. One such practical example is the recommendation of herbicide use
    along with the suggestion of non-chemical weed control by a DSS, which investigated
    100 weed species and more than 30 crops, in Denmark [80]. Since RS provides near-real-time
    information, it can play a key role in the development of an efficient DSS, which
    will further support agricultural sustainability. RS provides the temporal and
    spatial attributes of a crop that can be used to improve decision making, as they
    can augment various field data and significant parameters [81]. For instance,
    DSS may establish a site-specific herbicide application map, predicting specific
    weed species or invasive plants [80]. Such technological interventions in this
    5th industrial revolution have the potential to combat climate change (by reducing
    the use of fertilizers) and reduce input costs. Despite the promising uses of
    DSS, its integration into agriculture is not prominent due to a number of factors.
    Examples of these limiting factors include high economic cost, lack of awareness
    or lower comprehension by farmers, the gap between the decision-making style required
    by DSS and the different types of farmer requirements, restrictions in capturing
    and storing environmental or biological data, etc. [79,80]. 4. Sensors The backbone
    of RS is the sensors that provide all the basic information, not only of crops,
    but also of the environment. The quality and yield of the plants is highly dependent
    on factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and the level of carbon dioxide
    (CO2) [82]. These factors, along with a variety of other parameters, can easily
    be measured using sensors [32]. Sensors usually serve for narrow band hyperspectral
    or broad band multispectral data acquisition, and can be space-borne, air-borne,
    and ground-based in terms of their respective use in satellites, RPAs, and fields
    or laboratories, respectively [40]. Currently, the most commonly used sensors
    in agricultural RS include synthetic aperture radar (SAR), near-infrared (NIR),
    light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging, multispectral,
    and visible RGB (VIS) sensors; thereby studying a variety of parameters according
    to needs. Table 1 lists the RS sensors, grouped under main categories, with their
    respective applications in agriculture. For an elaborated use of different sensors
    in agriculture, the study by Yang et al. [83] is recommended. Table 1. Principal
    categories of remote sensing (RS) sensors with their respective functions in agricultural
    studies. Ground-based sensors have long been in use, i.e., since the third industrial
    revolution, and those of the current era are wireless sensor technologies (WSTs).
    WSTs use radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    [88]. The 5th industrial revolution has also resulted in rapid research and development
    in terms of smaller sensing devices, digital circuits, and radio frequency technology.
    The principal difference between RFID and WSN is that WSN permits multihop communication
    and network topologies, whereas no cooperative capabilities are offered by RFID
    devices. Now, WSNs are, not only the base of precision agriculture, but also that
    of precision livestock farming and precision poultry farming. RFID, which was
    basically developed for identification purposes, is currently being used for developing
    new wireless sensor devices. These systems comprise of a number of tiny sensor
    nodes (consisting of three basic components: sensing, processing, and communication)
    and few sinks. Each wireless sensor node can be employed in the desired crop field
    and are linked through a gateway unit, communicating with other computer systems
    via wireless local area networks (WLAN), local area networks (LAN), the Internet,
    wireless wide area network (WWAN), or controller area network (CAN), making use
    of standard protocols (i.e., general packet radio service (GPRS) or global system
    for mobile communication (GSM)) [10]. Given the maturity and potential of these
    technologies, they seem to be promising technologies for agricultural remote sensing.
    Another reason for WSN implementation in agriculture is a prerequisite of DSS
    is that it needs processed information rather than sensor-taken raw data. Therefore,
    WSNs using a meshed network of wireless sensors collect, process, and communicate
    the data for DSS, thus ensuring a controlled system [45]. WST applications in
    the agricultural sector have gone through considerable research and it is found
    to be very common in greenhouse and livestock monitoring applications. These applications
    are becoming more common by the day. Additionally, it is also important to consider
    challenges, e.g., weather conditions, reliable link quality above crop canopies,
    and coverage, that are faced when implementing radio frequencies in crop fields.
    It is also important in remote sensing that there be a mechanism of erroneous
    measurement detection, thereby rectifying wrongly collected data. Actual examples
    of the applications of WST, although few, include creating a mobile WSN connecting
    tractors or combining harvesters with other vehicles, enabling them to exchange
    data [10]. Recently, a customized WSN was used to detect fungal disease in a strawberry
    production using a distributed mesh network of wireless mini weather stations,
    equipped with relative humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness sensors. Similarly,
    other studies included the implementation of WSN in vineyards for precision viticulture
    and addressed heat summation and potential frost damage [10]. Similarly, various
    other studies on their application in irrigation, greenhouse, and horticulture
    domains have been reported [45]. However, it is important to consider that there
    is an immense need for a standard body to regulate agricultural sensor device
    development as well as their subsequent implementation in modeling and DSS. These
    technologies have been in constant transition over the past few years, e.g., updating
    various ISO (International Organization for Standards) standards for RFID (ISO/IEC
    18000, ISO 11784, etc.), Bluetooth, Wibree, WiFi, and ZigBee for WSNs [88,89].
    Various studies have reported on the use of these technologies, such as the use
    of ZigBee for precision agriculture (elaborated by Sahitya et al. [90]). A substantial
    improvement in WSN for subsequent incorporation into satellites and RPAs will
    certainly augment the efficiency of these platforms. For a summary of some of
    the commonly implied sensors in agriculture that provide data about plant, soil,
    and climate conditions, the study by Abbasi et al. [89] is recommended. A lot
    of renowned companies and institutes, including NASA, are involved in the production
    of novel and efficient sensors. For example, the Microsoft Kinect sensor developed
    in the last decade shows remarkable potential for rapid characterization of vegetation
    structure, as reported previously [91]. For a comprehensive study on the latest
    advances in sensor technology applied to the agricultural sector, the study by
    Kayad et al. is recommended [26]. Joint ventures by governments and academic institutes,
    apart from those of the private sector, in the implementation of sensor technology
    can bear rapid and efficient results, such as the Center of Satellite Communication
    and Remote Sensing at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), and the Turkish Statistical
    Institute joining hands to realize the sensor-driven agricultural monitoring and
    information system (TARBIL) project [92]. Various sensors are being currently
    invented and developed, through private firms and joint ventures, based on wireless
    technology for subsequent applications in viticulture, irrigation, greenhouse,
    horticulture, pest control, fertilization, etc. [89], but this also highlights
    the necessity of some regulating and standard bodies. Similarly, John Deere, a
    leading farming equipment company, is currently undertaking various IoT projects,
    including sensor-fitted autonomous tractors, capable of yield estimation features,
    among various other features [93]. Apart from the industrial perspective, a great
    deal of research in the academic domain is also on the rise in this sphere. These
    technologies are promising for efficient and sustainable farming, which is basically
    expected in the 5th industrial revolution. Satellites and RPAs are two prominent
    platforms of RS technology and therefore, it is important to consider their use
    in the 5th industrial revolution, mainly focusing on the agricultural sector.
    Various studies have highlighted the limitations of the one or the other, but
    both are beneficial in general. In this regard, their current and future roles
    in on-board sensors and cameras are reported here. 4.1. Satellite One of the oldest
    and main platforms of RS technology is the satellite. In 1957, the first ever
    satellite: Sputnik 1, weighing 183 pounds and the size of a basketball, was launched
    into space by the Soviet Union [94]. It has been over 40 years since satellite
    systems became operational, but a milestone in RS was achieved with the creation
    of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, providing information about
    land cover, phenology, and vegetation activity, using advanced very high resolution
    radiometer (AVHRR) [35]. In terms of improved performance, considering geometric,
    spectral, and radiometric properties, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) significantly helped with remote sensing. MODIS instruments laid the foundation
    of a new era in remote sensing after their launch in 1999, providing 1-km spatial
    resolution GPP products [35]. Numerous satellites had been launched in the past
    two decades with various spatial and temporal resolutions [95], which proved to
    be the basis of the 5th technological revolution. Today, various privately-held
    and government-managed satellites harboring versatile sensors are an efficient
    foundation to RS, thereby providing huge sets of interpretable data and information.
    For example, Spain started its “National Remote Sensing Plan (PNT)” in 2004, aimed
    at data provisioning for various Spanish public administrations [96]. Although,
    it is important to bear in mind that this domain was envisaged with a little boost
    in 2008, when Landsat (US operated satellites) images were set freely accessible
    (under open license), and the launch of Sentinel 1A and Sentinel 2A satellites,
    in 2014 and 2015, respectively, under the Copernicus Program, further increased
    the momentum of RS. The Sentinel constellation is the part of Copernicus program
    that was launched by the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA).
    As more than 30 satellites provide data for this program, it is of great use to
    scientists to analyze the freely available data regarding agriculture. In addition,
    a separate database, titled “Copernicus Academic”, of the Copernicus program also
    facilitates the training and better utilization of satellite data [97]. Similarly,
    the Landsat program, launched by the United States as a joint venture between
    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States
    Geological Survey (USGS), also offers free access to high-resolution images. The
    present needs are to wisely utilize these free accessible data to achieve ambitious
    agricultural goals. Furthermore, space-borne hyperspectral missions, such as ZY1-AHSI,
    PRISMA, DESIS, and GF5-AHSI, which launched recently, or are planned to be launched
    in upcoming years, such as SBG, CHIME, and EnMAP, are expected to augment agricultural
    monitoring in terms of vegetation functions and traits. It is imperative to address
    recurring limitations, such as soil background and canopy structure interference,
    signal variations in optical vegetation properties, and poor discrimination of
    functional traits due to lesser narrow spectral regions [2]. Recently, a cloud-free
    crop map service utilizing radar and optical data from Sentinel-1 and -2, respectively,
    was announced under a joint venture by two private companies i.e., VanderSat and
    BASF Digital Farming GmbH, thereby providing daily maps of field-scale crop biomass
    [98]. This advancement is a remarkable breakthrough in RS from satellites, as
    it has been a great challenge since the beginning of this technology. Recent advances
    in this technology are making it a fine and efficient technology through the use
    of machine learning. A study conducted by Mazzia et al. [99] reported a novel
    strategy for refining the freely available photos from satellites to minimize
    the errors often encountered by their low or moderate resolutions. This is an
    excellent example of the use of blended technology, where the authors trained
    a convolutional neural network using high-resolution images from RPA and then
    derived the NDVI to interpret the low- or moderate-resolution satellite images
    of vineyard vigor maps. Among other uses of this RS platform, one is the construction
    of historical maps of crops, as these play a significant role in crop prediction
    estimation and related simulations. Recently, a study established the relationship
    between MODIS-derived NDVI and the grain yields of wheat, barley, and all cereals
    for 20 European countries (including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
    Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, etc.). After analyzing the data from 2010
    to 2018, a higher percentage of cereals was reported; 35% for arable land. The
    efficacy of yield prediction in relation to NDVI and cereals was reported as trustworthy
    over a good time period of 4 months [100]. More studies of this nature on a global
    scale are needed to strengthen the agriculture of today. Implementation of existing
    technological tools is also very important. For instance, Google Earth Engine
    (GEE) offers diverse services in this domain for the agricultural industry. GEE
    facilitates product downloading of various satellites imagery (Landsat, Sentinels,
    MODIS, etc.) along with cloud-based management, by granting access either through
    an academic email or simply a standard Gmail account to their servers. Processing
    very large geospatial datasets often makes the process slow and difficult. In
    this regard, GEE, a cloud-based platform, facilitates access to high-performance
    computing resources without any cost. Systematic data products and interactive
    applications can be developed based on GEE once an algorithm is developed—thereby
    reducing the complexities of programming and application development [45]. A stepwise
    illustration for product downloads from GEE is presented in Figure 2, although
    the final exported product can be different from this illustration, based on the
    needs and preferred format. Figure 2. A stepwise illustration (1 to 7) of processing
    and downloading satellite imagery products from Google Earth Engine (GEE). A practical
    example of benefiting from free services GEE is presented as the construction
    of vegetation indices (VIs) maps for olive grove trees located at Guadahortuna
    (Granada, Spain) (Figure 3). Sentinel-2 images, between July 2020 and February
    2021, were accessed through GEE, at a resolution of 10 × 10, and were processed
    to generate NDVI (as indicated in the below formula) vector tiles, followed by
    their export into GeoJSON format. The GeoJSON format is user friendly and generates
    data in the form of a table where each pixel represents a file with its NDVI value,
    which is quite handy to work with. Figure 3. Sentinel-2 images accessed through
    Google Earth Engine (GEE). (A) Area of interest, (B) RGB field composition, (C)
    NDVI raster tile, (D) NDVI vector tile, (E) RGB field composition, (F) NDVI raster
    tile (Images facilitated by Graniot). Likewise, another practical example of this
    nature is the data acquisition, via GEE, for a parcel of vineyard crop situated
    at Reggio Emilia (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) (Figure 4). In both of these examples,
    NDVI was calculated using the following formula: NDVI= NIR−VIS NIR+VIS =[Sentinel2
    Bands] 𝐵08−𝐵04 𝐵08+𝐵04 where NIR is the near-infrared band and the VIS is the
    visible red. Bands 8 and 4 of Sentinel-2 were used given their desired spatial
    resolution of 10 m as well as their spectral range (e.g., bands 8 and 4 measure
    NIR and red spectral bands, respectively) to calculate the NDVI. These serve as
    an example of free data acquisition and processing; the future promises enormous
    possibilities. The only need is to make use of such freely available resources
    for academic, as well as real-world, applications. Figure 4. Sentinel-2 images
    accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE). (A) Area of interest, (B) RGB field
    composition, (C) NDVI raster tile, (D) RGB field composition, (E) NDVI raster
    tile, (F) NDVI vector tile (Images facilitated by Graniot). Another important
    aspect of using satellite technology is the digital boundaries of crop fields
    that are a pre-requisite. Areas with intensive agriculture have solved this, but,
    for small crop areas (>1 ha), it persists. The 5th revolution is playing its part
    here. Recently, a novel method, “DESTIN”, of crop field delineation was reported
    with an accuracy of 95–99%, fusing temporal and spatial information acquired from
    WorldView and Planet satellite imagery [101]. Such types of studies are opening
    up the way for digitalizing agriculture and making it sustainable. This new era
    is not just about processing acquired data it is also about optimizing it for
    improved-quality products. For example, a recent study on formulating optimal
    segmentation parameters to obtain precise spatial information of agricultural
    parcels that normally suffer over- or under-segmentation is an evident demonstration
    of this idea [102]. This is not just limited to the optimization of satellite
    imagery, it is a way to achieve automation and implementation of these technologies
    on all scales. 4.2. Remotely Piloted Aircrafts (RPAs) A rise in the use of this
    technology has been seen over the past decade given its worth as an integral part
    of RS technology. Intensive research has been conducted using RPAs, considering
    their application in crop monitoring, disease surveillance, soil analysis, irrigation,
    fertilization, mechanical pollination, weed management, crop harvest, crop insurance,
    tree plantation, etc. [7] (Figure 5), which obviously hints towards their remarkable
    potential in the agricultural sector. Figure 5. A schematic diagram of RPA application
    in agriculture. The first use of RPAs in agriculture was reported as back as 1986
    for monitoring Montana’s forest fires [7]. This 5th revolution is anticipated
    to make more frequent use of RPAs in farming. According to an estimate, RPAs and
    the agricultural robotics industry could be worth as much as 28 billion dollars
    by 2028 and up to 35 billion dollars by 2038 [103]. The use of RPA imagery consists
    of mission or flight planning, data collection, data processing, and information
    report generation. Several free resources are available for each of these purposes.
    For example, QGroundControl is an open-source software that can act as a ground
    control station (GCS) for RPAs. Similarly, several user-friendly open-source software
    titles are available in the market for image processing, orthomosaic assembly,
    digital surface model (DSM), and digital elevation model (DEM) constructions.
    Open Drone Map (ODM) is a prominent example of this, and offers creations and
    visualizations of orthomosaic, point cloud, 3D models, and other products [7].
    RPAs offer better resolutions and flexibility of use over satellite imagery. A
    few such desired features help to monitor the most important crop parameters:
    nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll contents [36]. For example, Figure 6 shows an overview
    of the practical applications of RPAs to acquire Vis, such as NDVI, normalized
    difference red edge (NDRE) and thermal maps. A Yuneec Typhoon H hexacopter RPA,
    flown at a 100-m height, equipped with a multispectral camera (parrot sequoia)
    and a thermal sensor (Yuneec CGOET) was used to monitor olive crops in Cordoba,
    Spain. After processing the images, treatment zones were indicated depending upon
    the vegetation vigour, stress, and N content (Figure 7). Figure 6. Vegetation
    index (VIs) maps generated through Parrot Sequoia (a multispectral camera) and
    Yuneec CGOET (a thermal sensor) mounted on Yuneec Typhoon H hexacopter RPA. (A)
    Crop area studied. (B) Map of “chlorophyll a” content based on NDRE. (C) Map for
    vegetation status generated based on NDVI. (D) Thermal map established using Yuneec

    for treatment based on the vegetation indices (VIs) maps, generated using a parrot
    sequoia and Yuneec CGOET mounted on a Yuneec Typhoon H hexacopter RPA for olive
    crops (image facilitated by MCBiodrone). Quite a number of studies have reported
    on various aspect or uses of RPAs but it is interesting to learn what this new
    era means for one of these RS technologies. New research is being based on artificial
    intelligence to derive more detailed information about growth, yield, disease,
    and automation. For example, use of wireless sensor technology and control automation
    is on the rise in agriculture [104,105,106]. Some of the representative studies
    with respect to principal applications of RPAs in agriculture are summarized in
    Table 2. Table 2. A summary of a few representative studies for principal agricultural
    applications of RPAs. (The purpose of citing these references is impartial and
    is not confined to these studies only). One of the prominent features of this
    technology is its higher resolution than the satellite imagery—offering up to
    0.2 m of spatial resolution, which is approximately 40,000 times better resolution
    that means more and high-quality information can be extracted from these images.
    Furthermore, laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are using this
    technology to pave the way towards building 3D maps of plant canopy, soil, and
    field analysis, which are crucial factors for yield estimation, irrigation, and
    nutrients estimation, such as for N [7]. Nevertheless, impeding metrological conditions,
    local and national regulations, limited spatial coverage due to battery or payload
    limits, along with a lack of standard procedures for inflight calibration of RPA
    sensors [18,107] are few of the constraints of this platform. Likewise, it is
    also important to consider regional and national regulations for operating RPAs,
    although agricultural applications of RPAs do not invoke substantial risks for
    people. Government bodies are trying to cope with such regulations, but there
    is plenty of room for growth. In Europe, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency
    (EASA) presented legislative framework: “Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft
    Systems” (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and (EU) 2019/945), in 2019, for RPA operations
    and it went into effect from 31 December 2020 [138]. The three principal categories
    established under this legislation are presented in Table 3. Safety of people,
    security, privacy, and data protection were the principal parameters considered
    for establishing these regulations. Nevertheless, most countries are struggling
    to establish standard regulations, and this requires urgent attention. A general
    list of RPA laws and regulations can be consulted in [139]. Table 3. Three categories
    established by European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for operating RPAs.
    This new era is of the Internet of Drones (IoD), where a fleet of drones is deployed,
    controlled through a ground station server (GSS) via a wireless channel, to harvest
    the desired data. Currently, research is being undertaken to explore these possibilities
    for remote areas, where there is no Internet connection. For example, a recent
    study reported on the possibility of using a cellular network for this purpose
    [140]. An interesting study by Prasanna and Jebapriya [141] on the use of RPAs
    in smart agriculture, based on IoT, is highly recommended, where the possibilities
    of this novel technology with their practical examples are discussed. Similarly,
    novel applications of RPAs can also enrich RS technologies; for example, very
    recently, an RPA was used as a mobile gateway for a wireless sensor network (WSN),
    establishing a 24-m flying height and a 25-m antenna coverage provided maximum
    node density [142]. In the same way, the benefits of drone centimeter-scale multispectral
    imagery were investigated in sugar beet crop to improve the assessment of foliar
    and canopy parameters; five important structural and biochemical plant traits
    were reported, highlighting the importance of drone imagery for centimeter-scale
    characterization [4]. RPAs are already used for capturing videos and photos under
    specific flight plans, as such, setting an RPA as a node for a WSN is an efficient
    way to fully benefit from this RS tool. Despite the appeal of IoD, security may
    be a recurring issue in upcoming years; large companies are already at the brink
    of this issue. For this reason, thorough research in this domain is recommended
    to ensure a reliable application of RS. A recent study undertaken on this aspect
    of technology offers the implementation of blockchain and smart contracts to safeguard
    data, which are then archived through IoT-enabled RPAs and sensors, with their
    respective deployment considerations [143]. Alternative and economical solutions
    are urgently required to address these issues. 4.3. Satellite and RPAs: A Complementing
    System The use of RPAs versus satellites is often debated in the context of their
    agricultural applications. Nevertheless, the choice of any of these RS platforms
    is highly subjective to the needs of farmer and the crop to be studied. However,
    a minor comparison of these is presented considering their usefulness in RS. Limited
    battery life and flight time hinder extensive spatial coverage using RPAs, despite
    being regarded as optimal for providing robust, reliable and efficient crop phenotyping
    [144]. RPAs offer lower operational costs; however, for large amounts of data
    (to cover larger areas), data processing costs increase exponentially. Similarly,
    flexibility with flying times and the significant resolution of RPA imagery are
    desirable characteristics over satellite imagery [7]. On the other hand, freely
    accessible satellite data are gaining popularity. Even so, these freely available
    data come with coarser spatial and temporal resolutions (with the exception of
    a few commercial satellites), and is being used to generate VIs. In this regard,
    AI offers leverage to fine-tune coarser satellite data based on high-resolution
    drone data [5]. Moreover, a large dataset for training AI models, despite poor
    quality or noisiness, generates substantial results compared to smaller datasets,
    indicating the importance of huge datasets obtained through satellite imagery
    [5]. This is why big data holds a remarkable position in this regard. For example,
    a previously reported study demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning associated
    with the availability of large and high-quality training samples [145]. Furthermore,
    crop simulation models can be generated beforehand from these data for respective
    agronomic measures and crop yield estimations. Therefore, a complementing system
    based on these two RS platforms can supplement the efficiency of RS products.
    5. Future Perspective RS technology is anticipated to maximize the potential of
    the agricultural sector to feed future generations. Integration of modern science
    is greatly needed. A few possible future studies, with regard to the 5th industrial
    revolution, are hinted at below (Figure 8). Figure 8. Future considerations of
    remote sensing (RS) technology applied to agriculture. − Satellites, RPAs, and
    sensors seek a vast amount of data in a raw form, which requires tiresome pre-processing,
    processing, and data evaluation procedures. This is where big data comes in play
    and ML can be applied to handle this difficult task as an effective tool for managing
    and processing huge data sets, as has also been previously reported [42]. Although
    traditional ML methods (i.e., artificial neural networks, random forests, and
    support vector machines) provide the characteristics of a subject under study,
    these prove to be subjective and cumbersome processes when dealing with the problems
    of a complex domain, e.g., yield estimation of a crop or highly dimensional datasets
    [42]. Therefore, selection of key features is very important to further train
    models for a higher accuracy. Furthermore, such machine and deep learning models
    for various crop characteristics (i.e., stress, disease, ripeness, etc.) are urgently
    required for almost all of crops. For example, postharvest grading processes can
    be easily regulated by the implementation of quality-based ML fruit classification
    models. Similarly, an image offers a great deal of information, such as chlorophyll,
    plant canopy, size, color, fruit number, etc., which can be analyzed using various
    ML networks with the potential of minimizing input costs and making the crop yield
    more profitable. − Incorporation of GIS-enabled biosensors into plants cannot
    only help to reveal plant molecular processes, e.g., nutrients assimilation, production
    of antioxidants, etc., but also the location of pathogenic attack, drought stress,
    and other valuable growth parameters. − Novel low-cost sensors are highly in demand
    and can certainly complement the efficiency of RS technology. For example, novel
    sensors detecting ethylene gas levels, which is an indicator of fruit ripening
    [146], can help farmers to make essential management decisions before harvest.
    Similarly, durable ground-based sensors can be incorporated with cellular and
    WST technology for real time information gathering, as well as programing for
    respective measures. Further novel applications of sensor, as well as new sensors
    measuring a variety of parameters, can certainly take RS technology to another
    level. − An integrated and complementing system for satellites, automatically
    guided land vehicles (AGVs), and RPA imagery could be quite beneficial to overcome
    physical hurdles in data acquisition and improving the efficiency and accuracy
    of these technologies. Novel algorithms can also fill in this gap and, therefore,
    research should be focused on this domain. − Given the tremendous potential of
    LiDAR, it could be used to extract architectural information of crops, as well
    as of forests. Such morphological information can pave the way to unveil growth
    processes, phenotypic explorations, structural patterns, establishing biomass–yield
    relationships, etc. Using AI, this information could be amplified for various
    other plant species and even to simulate plants developmental behavior in space.
    − Freely available satellite imagery with coarse temporal and spatial resolutions
    have not been exploited for scale-appropriate precision agriculture applications
    [147]. These free resources can be manipulated in a number of ways to extract
    desired information; for example, historical and current field data can be a game
    changer for estimating soil fertility status, which immensely influences crop
    yield. Similarly, distanced and under-nourished plants in a field patch indicate
    inadequate growth conditions, e.g., salinity stress, drought stress, shallow patch,
    etc. This is quite valuable information for assuring precision. − The maturity
    of 5th generation (5G) technology is increasing the possibilities of automation
    of field processes and the acquisition of real-time information. During this 5th
    industrial revolution, 5G is a substantial performer that has the potential, not
    only to facilitate high speed connectivity, but also faster data acquisition followed
    by analysis. For example, Google Earth, a free geolocation search engine, facilitates
    access to satellite imagery and integrates a processing code that could generate
    NDVI in turn [148], subsequently producing desired analytics in a mobile application
    or webpage. A practical example is the private company Graniot, operating in Spain
    [149]. Another interesting implementation of 5G could be the real time streaming
    of ultra-high definition images (4K–8K), taken by RPAs along with its potential
    to overcome the severe regulations on beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flight
    challenges. These tools are not limited to these kinds of applications, but rather
    to the unlimited opportunities. Further startups of this kind can help to achieve
    sustainable agriculture. − Masking all the data analyzing processes and protecting
    the end user, especially farmers, from the perplexity of technical processes in
    the form of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) could greatly boost the incorporation
    of these technologies among small-scale farmers. Only a limited number of studies
    have been reported where a user can visualize and interpret data in the form of
    mobile or tablet applications [150,151,152]. The invention of such types of GUIs
    can further ease sustainability and the profitability of the sector. − Benefiting
    from radio signals, television communication systems and cellular data are also
    appealing aspects of RS applications in rural areas. Another attractive option
    is the use of hotspot satellites for the determined range and area. RS technology
    is quite mature in developed countries, but, for developing countries, these tools
    can outweigh resource scarcity. − An anticipated model considering this 5th revolution
    can be envisioned as one where data acquisition resources (e.g., sensors, RPAs,
    WSN, etc.) operate in synergy with field actors (e.g., tractors, AGVs, irrigation
    systems, spray systems, robots, etc.). Acquired crop data are then processed by
    cloud computing platforms, and ultimately generate insightful results. Thus, enabling
    the end user to interpret, make a reasoned decision or program a regulated activity
    through the corresponding GUI. Figure 9 shows this anticipated model. Figure 9.
    An anticipated model of remote sensing (RS) technologies applied to agriculture
    in the 5th industrial revolution. The figure can be read from left to right, where
    (A) represents the user control center, (B) represent servers, cloud and the related
    storage accessories, (C) represents the real players, e.g., satellites, remotely
    piloted aircrafts (RPAs), autonomous robots, metrological stations, etc., for
    data acquisition, (D) represent data processing using machine learning and related
    platforms that ultimately produce infographics and other useful information in
    (E). − The incorporation of RS technologies into agriculture can facilitate sector
    sustainability, but the associated costs could be a hindering factor. Today, most
    sensors applied in agriculture are quite expensive, along with the hiring of third
    party services for data interpretation. This is quite a big hurdle that need to
    be resolved. − Similarly, providing farmers with the basic skills needed for RS
    technology and training a fleet of young scientists can ease frustrations among
    people directly related to agriculture, like farmers, agronomists, extension workers,
    etc. The rate of adoption of a technology can be augmented using such measures.
    Private and public bodies can equally contribute to this sphere. − RS technology
    is no longer in its nascent phase and, therefore, a framework of proper vocabulary
    and standardization is urgently needed. Various terminologies are in use today
    that only create more confusion. An example of this problem is the naming of RPA
    technology—unmanned air vehicle (UAV) is the proper term for drones for few scientists,
    whereas others consider this term obsolete [7]. 6. Conclusions The study aimed
    to convey an overview of the principal players of RS technology, including satellites,
    RPAs, and sensors, in this new era of the 5th industrial revolution (of agriculture
    5.0); thus, highlighting its importance in achieving SDG-2. Satellites occupy
    a prominent place in RS technology that can be appended with IoD to maximize its
    potential in assuring sustainable agriculture. Satellite imagery data are freely
    accessible, and RPA technology becoming more and more economical with each passing
    day. Integrated application of these RS components and training ML models is what
    is expected from this 5th revolution. Few studies have been done on cohesive applications
    of AI in this field, such as automation in the fruit grading process, crop variety
    identification, visual representation of data analysis in the mobile applications,
    etc. Moving forward, the aim is to improve resource use efficiency. Similarly,
    there is a need to address the limitations of AI in terms of model training, standardization,
    and oversimplifications of reality. With the novel technologies come the novel
    challenges; initiating novel research projects addressing challenges of data privacy,
    slow data processing, lack of historical maps, cost of sensors, standardization,
    processing complexity, training, etc., can effectively contribute to, not only
    the dissemination of novel technologies, e.g., IoT, IoE, IoD, ML, etc., but also
    adoption, thereby promising a sustainable agriculture 5.0. Author Contributions

    The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) [1], Edge computing, etc., is paving
    a path for these technologies to easily purge into the anthropogenic activities.
    There has been a fourth farming revolution, Farming 4.0 [2] in the developed nations,
    which amalgamate Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) with usual farming
    practices. Hence, it is only a matter of time that ICT will find its way into
    the agriculture sector for sustainable development. IoT is one such technology
    that has established its omnipresence in cross-cutting majors. IoT facilitates
    smart and intelligent connectivity of physical devices, such as sensors, actuators,
    and network connectivity modules, enabling smooth communication for collection,
    sharing, and exchange of data between the devices as well as machines and humans
    creating a collaborative environment in real-time scenario as stated by Misra
    et al. [1]. IoT and wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been implemented for water-saving
    methods for water management of irrigated field, soil moisture and groundwater
    level monitoring, precision agricultural monitoring, etc. Bhatnagar and Chandra
    [3] focused on soil health monitoring that shows the instantaneous reading of
    various parameters such as temperature, soil moisture, pH, and humidity in the
    screen of a farmer''s smartphone. Soil turbidity is a very important parameter
    that seems to be missing from this article. Dasig, Jr., [4] has discussed the
    implementation of IoT and WSN for precision agriculture in detail emulating the
    advancement toward Agricultural 4.0. Yu et al. [5] have developed, \"Plant Spike,\"
    a low-cost, energy-efficient, WSN system for soil health monitoring in the urban
    areas making it worthy of smart farming applications. While these sounds are easier
    to apply and get used to from a researcher''s perspective, it might be exactly
    that difficult for a farmer to get along. Hence, it is always desirable to keep
    things as simple as possible. Existing literature fails to provide an integrated
    solution as the focus has been on either sensor-specific or issue specifically.
    Integrated devices addressing both cases as well as economic aspects of the farmers
    in the rural areas are scant. Our current configuration is an \"all-in-a-box\"
    solution that eliminates the possibility of deployment of multiple hardware devices
    decreasing the overall cost of the device setup. To address the issues, we propose
    FarmFox, an IoT-based soil health monitoring system for the better yield of the
    crops, especially in rural areas where the internet is available. In summary,
    the contributions of this article are as follows. We introduce FarmFox an advanced
    IoT device to monitor soil health. It utilizes Representational State Transfer
    Application Programming Interface (REST API) protocol to fetch the data from the
    sensor and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to send the data to the cloud for
    analysis. A Wi-Fi-enabled sensor node that can monitor several parameters of the
    soil such as pH, turbidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature. RELATED WORKS
    IoT-Based Solution for Precision Agriculture As discussed in the previous section,
    IoT finds its application for soil health monitoring for the development of precision
    and sustainable agricultural methods. Nurzaman et al. [6] used IoT for crop health
    monitoring and also to maximize agricultural output. AgriTalk, a cost-effective
    IoT platform was designed and tested for turmeric cultivation. They have found
    significantly low response time in the case of AgriTalk in the dynamic change
    in field environment conditions and that too in a distance range of more than
    30 km [7]. Goswami et al. [8] developed an IoT-based soil health monitoring system
    that monitors macronutrients N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus), K (Potassium), pH,
    soil moisture, and soil humidity. Salam [9] has presented the contemporary communication
    archetypes, primary sensor equipment, and communication tools including recent
    advancements in the field of agricultural IoT. The work also provokes industry–farmer
    engagements for sustainable production practices. Lee et al. [7] offered IoT-based
    farming system to stabilize the demand and supply chain of agronomic yields, whereas
    incorporating the essential sensor devices along with the forecast mechanism for
    the yield production and growth. Here, the researchers have implemented LR-WPAN
    compatible multisensors, wired and wireless protocols, HSDPA/Dual CDMA, etc.,
    to achieve their project objectives. WSN-Based Solution for Precision Agriculture
    WSN-based solutions for precision agriculture is another wide area, which could
    enhance the final output by monitoring soil and crop health. Precision agriculture
    is now stepping one footstep ahead because of several applications that are enhancing
    the efficacy, production, lucrativeness in farm products, and are keeping good
    control of the environment and wildlife at the same time. The field data in real-time
    can offer a good foundation for farmers and agro-researchers to make decisions
    and build strategies accordingly. This, in turn, helps on improving the decision-making
    process, which was earlier based only on some typical theoretical conditions.
    Apart from the monitoring purpose, wireless sensors can also be combined into
    automated systems. Few research directions of WSN in automated precision agriculture
    are the low-energy irrigation control and smart fertilization [10]. Extension
    of these works also has proposed smart energy-efficient routing schemes that will
    enhance the lifetime of the network. These new routing protocols have fuzzy rules
    implemented to take intelligent decisions. FarmFox ARCHITECTURE The architecture
    of FarmFox is presented comprehensively in this section. Figure 1 illustrates
    the conceptual architecture of FarmFox. We have followed the orthodox conceptual
    architecture of WSN toward the architecture of IoT. Figure 1. Architecture of
    FarmFox. Show All The overall architecture can be divided into following three
    layers. Sensing Layer The sensing layer is the heart of this device. In this layer,
    sensor nodes are placed in the field to sense and collect data. The collected
    data are sent to the IoT gateway using Wi-Fi. The gateway nodes, in turn, send
    the data to the remote server in form of packets. Wi-Fi provides the elemental
    communication of the IoT architecture to enable the assimilation and interrelationship
    of physical and cyber modes, thus creating a cyber–physical system. The USP of
    this system is that the sensing data are stored in the electronic programmable
    read-only memory (EPROM), which ensures no-data loss during a power failure. Remote
    Processing Layer This layer is the brain of the device, which links the application
    layer with the sensor layer. The requests received from the top and bottom layers
    of FarmFox are processed in this layer. The remote processing layer controls operation
    in the field from a remote location. Application Layer The application layer enables
    the farmers and the analytics to visualize the collected data in their cell phones
    and computers. By using an Internet connection and GPS tracking system, the location
    of a specific node can be traced by the farmers. The application layer, hence,
    is key to retrieving outputs, which can be later analyzed. DESIGN OF FarmFox In
    this section, we present the design of the FarmFox box. The key constructs that
    motivated us to design these nodes are cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency,
    reliability, and robustness. Integrated Design of Sensor Nodes The sensor nodes
    used in developing FarmFox are arranged in a waterproof outlay. These nodes consume
    an ample amount of energy, which is covered with solar power. We have used Arduino
    Nano R3 along with ESP-01S for Wi-Fi connectivity, whereas RTC-DS3231 was employed
    to achieve the active sleep mode of the sensor nodes. The choice of using Arduino
    over other commercial alternatives was driven by the low-cost design motivation
    and the reliability qualification results shows that the projected data retention
    failure rate is much as 1PPM (parts per million) over 20 years under drastic atmospheric
    condition. The pin diagram of the sensor nodes is presented in Figure 2. Figure
    2. PIN diagram of the sensor node. Show All The pin diagram depicts the connections
    of the different components of the node with the processor. The solar panel and
    the battery charge module (TP4056) are connected using a bridge LM2596 DC to DC
    to charge the battery from the voltage produced by the solar panel that keeps
    the sensor node active. The deployed block diagram detail is shown in Figure 3.
    Figure 3. Deployed sensor node block diagram of FarmFox. Show All Integrated Design
    of the Sensors We have used precalibrated four digital sensors for measuring four
    vital parameters—moisture, temperature, turbidity, and pH. These parameters help
    in monitoring the soil health, which can be utilized to the advantage of the farmers
    for a better yield. Figure 4 illustrates the four sensors used for developing
    FarmFox, namely V2 soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor DS18B20, turbidity
    sensor, and soil pH sensor. As mentioned before, these sensors are connected to
    Arduino Nano R3, which can be placed to a maximum depth of 20 cm in the soil to
    measure the moisture, temperature, and pH. The turbidity sensors are placed in
    the field in an exquisite manner that can measure the cloudiness of the water
    used for irrigation purposes. Turbidity along with the pH measurement may state
    the current soil health to the analyzer. This shows that FarmFox is a robust system.
    Figure 4. Field setup with FarmFox at the test location. Show All Integrated Design
    of the IoT Gateway In any IoT environment, IoT gateway plays an important role.
    It acts as a communication bridge, connecting the sensors to the Internet, Bluetooth
    devices with built-in cloud interface, etc. It also helps in latency reduction
    and capacity enhancement at the edge by prehandling the raw data. In FarmFox,
    an IoT gateway is used to transfer the data from the field to the sink node for
    the analysis of data. Two highly used protocols namely Wi-Fi and TCP are used
    to meet the said purpose. We have designed a website for controlling and monitoring
    the sensors. It also helps in the retrieval of sensor data. Every gateway is assigned
    with a randomly generated unique user ID after we sign up on the website. We have
    used a solar panel along with a Li-ion battery to power up the sensor nodes. Implementation
    of Remote Servers In our design, we have developed two different servers: 1) repository
    server and 2) web server. The repository servers are used as the central server
    system that stores all the data, both relevant and irrelevant, whereas the web
    server is used to store webserver software and website''s component files. The
    servers are hosted in a cloud medium. The use of these two servers enables the
    FarmFox system to monitor the soil health remotely, which makes it a \"one of
    a kind\" system for precision agriculture. IMPLEMENTATION OF FarmFox We implanted
    and deployed FarmFox in the crop fields near CIET, BudBud campus (23.4078236,
    87.5529721), Burdwan District, West Bengal, India. Experimental setup is shown
    in Figure 4. The experiment has been carried out within January 2020 to March
    2020. Soil health monitoring is divided into two sections—a) data aggregation
    and b) data transmission. Data Sensing and Data Aggregation Data sensing and data
    aggregation is the most intrinsic part of the whole process. In this process,
    the sensor nodes measure the changes in stimuli light, heat, sound, motion, magnetic
    field, etc., and then converts them into electrical signals. These changes are
    passed through an interface to convert it into binary format and then after processing
    we get the reading. The sensors deployed in the case study area, collect data
    about moisture, temperature, turbidity, and pH of the soil, which is then stored
    in the in-built EPROM of 512 B of the FarmFox system. The sensed data are immediately
    fed to a connected cloud source. Hence, the aggregate can be accessed remotely
    with a PC having an internet connection. The uniqueness of the FarmFox model is
    that, in absence of a healthy internet connection, sensed data will not be lost,
    rather it will be stored in the EPROM. Upon, restoration of the internet connection,
    the data will be uploaded in the cloud storage. Hence, time-series data analysis
    and implementation of other statistical and machine learning techniques become
    much easier. Data Transmission The data transmission part is achieved through
    the following steps. Localized Communication We use IEEE 802.11 b/g/n protocol
    generally known as Wi-Fi to establish localized communication between sensor nodes
    and IoT gateway. The ESP-01S receives the Wi-Fi signal from the nearby data collecting
    center CIET budbud campus. Time Division Multiplexing Access is used to make collision-free
    data transmission among sensor nodes within the gateway. We keep the microcontroller
    active as it operates in ultralow-power along with the ESP01S, which is kept at
    sleep mode during the collection of data and inactive mode during the transmission
    of the data to the sink node. The sleep mode and active mode are achieved using
    RTC, which makes power-hungry sensor nodes energy efficient. Remote Communication
    Remote communication for FarmFox is established using two servers: a) repository
    server and b) web server. Repository Server The gateway node from each monitoring
    area establishes a connection with the remote repository data server using the
    Wi-Fi protocol. For the processing of data, the server extracts the meaningful
    information from the incoming packets and the sensed raw data are calibrated.
    Thingspeak is the repository cloud server that collects the data from the sensor
    and represents it in a graphical format. Figure 5(a)–(c) exhibits a steady growing
    profile, whereas Figure 5(d) shows a decreasing profile, which is in line with
    the real phenomena. Figure 5. Graphical representation of sensed data. (a) Graph
    for pH. (b) Graph for soil moisture. (c) Graph for temperature. (d) Graph for
    turbidity. Show All Webserver It is a webpage, where farmers or analysts can login
    and check the information with UID. In this article, we are using “remoteme,”
    a server site, which hosts the website and pulls the weather data. COMPARATIVE
    ANALYSIS Testing parameters and values are shown in Table 1. Table 1. FarmFox
    Testing Parameters. Table 2 shows the domination of FarmFox over the other available
    solutions concerning the working parameters. All the sensed data values are mainly
    preserved and applied for the generation of intelligent solutions, such as design
    of smart soil watering system and energy-efficient irrigation [11]. Table 2. Comparison
    of FarmFox With Other Systems. CONCLUSIONS We have developed an IoT-based automated
    soil health monitoring system, equipped to deal with agricultural parameters.
    Farmers will be able to integrate different field parameters to take smart decisions
    according to the situation. FarmFox can be directly connected to the cloud and
    capable of remote data storage/retrieval facilities. This article can further
    be extended to incorporate AI /machine learning algorithms to help the agro-scientists
    and farmers taking smarter decisions and strategy formations toward Agriculture

    1. Introduction One of the great challenges of humanity to the development of
    Sustainable Agriculture is to feed a growing world population in a sustainable
    way, preserving and maintaining a dynamic balance between the economy, society
    and the environment (Fernandez et al., 2018; Nuttavuthisit 2017). In order to
    produce changes in agricultural practices towards a sustainable agriculture, Higher
    Education Institutes (HEIs) should integrate agricultural sustainable development
    in the undergraduate and MSc programmes by teaching and training students, agricultural
    technicians and researchers with the latest knowledge and practices in sustainable
    agriculture. In this way, awareness of environmental problems and implementation
    of measures will lead to sustainable food production to feed an exponentially
    growing population. In addition, COVID-19 pandemic has affected/destabilized traditional
    learning methods, forcing a sudden learning shift to online methods. The present
    study aims to identify the best practices to be taken into account when developing
    a MSc programme of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Agriculture
    based on questionnaires developed in order to define the fundamental competences/expertise,
    the Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAP) and the methods of training/learning
    that should be taken in consideration in the MSc programme. This study is expected
    to contribute for the development of a long-term MSc programme to ensure a safe
    and sustainable agricultural production, taking in consideration environmental,
    social and economic aspects. 2. Literature review Since the 1980s, the concept
    of sustainable development has been introduced to address the shortcomings of
    the industrial agrifood model and preserving the environment, biodiversity and
    ecosystems (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2013). The industrial agrifood model is characterized
    by being highly dependent on inputs produced industrially, fossil fuels and water
    and by an agriculture with intensive use of capital, high production and high
    yield, specialized and rationalized (Knickel et al., 2017; Fernandez et al., 2018).
    Thus, a Sustainable Agriculture strategy that promotes the environment should
    be developed based on agroecological principles in order to solve the problems
    of poverty, food insecurity and environmental degradation (Altieri, Rosset, and
    Thrupp 1998). The concept of agroecology effectively addresses these problems
    of hunger, poverty and inequality, by reducing the loss of biodiversity and providing
    more resilience to climate change (FAO, 2015; IAASTD 2009; De Schutter 2010).
    This concept consists of “applying ecological principles to the design and management
    of agroecosystems through the integration of traditional and scientific knowledge”
    (Altieri 1995). In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the need for robust
    and resilient EU food systems based on a sustainable bioeconomy prepared to respond
    to global shocks and disruptions in supply chains, to assure agricultural resources
    and food availability and to mitigate socio-economic impacts of crises, especially
    regarding food scarcity (UN-FAO 2020). In order to be prepared to face this type
    of pandemic situation, all countries need to promote and create healthier, sustainable,
    equitable and resilient food systems (ESCAP et al., 2020) and include complex
    systems linking agriculture, food, health and climate (Blay-Palmer et al., 2020;
    Gunther 2020; Knickel et al., 2017). Implementing sustainable food production
    and consumption will boost the economy, improve people’s health and quality of
    life, care for nature and everyone (European Union, 2020). According with Koukios
    et al. (2018), bioeconomy, an innovative approach to the economy of the future,
    will act as a driver to enhance the economies and societies of countries that
    experienced deep and complex systemic crises. Sustainable bioeconomy therefore
    needs new agricultural practices, new patterns of consumer behaviour, new industrial
    technologies, new business models, new skill profiles and new regulations and
    governance approaches to be implemented in order to ensure long-term protection
    of natural resources (Koukios et al., 2018). Moreover, Mockshell and Kamanda (2018)
    showed the importance of using the three dimensions of sustainability (ecological,
    social and economic) to assess the performance of a Sustainable Agriculture production
    system and to propose transformation paths. Other important challenges, but controversial
    among development partners, scientists and policymakers are achieving food security
    and improving nutrition (Mockshell and Kamanda 2018). The interest in increasing
    food production and, at the same time, reducing damage to the environment is captured
    in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2015) and in the European
    Green Deal (European Union, 2020). According to the Agenda 2030, agricultural
    and food systems should be more efficient and sustainable, and society should
    adopt a more sustainable consumption and production (Knickel et al., 2017). The
    Agenda 2030 promotes the creation of resilient food systems and the strengthening
    of markets so that people can access safe and nutritious food (UN 2016). In addition,
    the second Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations has the challenge
    of ensuring Sustainable Agriculture for the long-term food security of a growing
    world population, to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition (UN
    2016). Further, the European Green Deal aims, through the Farm to Fork Strategy,
    to show how Europeans valorise food sustainability enhancing food systems fair,
    healthy and environmentally-friendly (European Union, 2020). Thus, Sustainable
    Agriculture is urgently needed to promote conservation and sustainable resources
    use in an equitable manner through integrated management of land, water and living
    resources (Carlisle et al., 2019). Sustainable Agriculture aims to increase the
    productivity without affecting the quality of soil and water, preserve the ecosystems,
    safeguard animal welfare, generate income for farms and improve quality of life
    in rural areas, support territorial development and contribute to economy (Cioloş
    2012). In this way, the improvement of diverse landscapes, biodiversity and maintenance
    of ecosystem functions can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, halting biodiversity
    loss and caring for valued landscapes (Knickel et al., 2017). Therefore, to face
    the current and new challenges and opportunities, farmers, technicians and agricultural
    workers, need to be provided with know-how and technology to implement the changes,
    as well as, a smart governance system, fully set up, linking research, support
    services, farmers and their organizations and markets (Carlisle et al., 2019).
    The education in agriculture emerges as a crucial tool for preparing agricultural
    technicians and researchers, farmers and workers to make productive contributions.
    Furthermore, it demonstrates the need to reformulate and revise educational programs
    in the area of sustainability. Since 2014, at the closing conference of the United
    Nations Decade for ESD in 2005–14 (Aichi-Nagoya, Japan), there is a growing concern
    on the implementation of programs of ESD or sustainability education (UNESCO 2014;
    Figueiró and Raufflet 2015; Verhulst and Lambrechts 2015; Lambrechts et al., 2013).
    At this conference, the Declaration on Higher Education for Sustainable Development
    was presented, which promotes a ‘transformative role of higher education towards
    sustainable development’ through ‘transformative learning and research’, produced
    by representative government and university groups and United Nations organizations
    (HESD 2014). This declaration reflects the significant degree of international
    consensus on the importance of HEIs to play a leading role and to transformer
    in promoting sustainable development worldwide (Pashby and de Oliveira Andreotti
    2016). Thus, the HEIs, such as Universities, arise with an important mission of
    education in the context of social transformation and to integrate sustainable
    development into the educational system as a scientific subject (Clark 1986; Bursztyn
    2008; Axelrod 1994). HEIs should undergo changes in the educational approach by
    putting in practice the new principles, knowledge, skills, perspectives and values
    associated with sustainability for the present and future communities (Faham et
    al., 2017) to educate new generations of leaders and citizens (Meadows 1997).
    One way to implement the know-how in sustainable agriculture is through MSc programmes
    since public is more aware of environmental problems and the offer of educational
    courses in the universities is increasing in this area (Azeiteiro et al., 2015).
    Also, MSc courses revealed to be important advance courses taught at HEIs which
    should provide effective and useful educational experiences to engage students
    in the global, economic, environmental, and societal impact of Sustainable Agriculture
    (Lewis et al., 2011), since pedagogy issues are vital to reorienting education
    towards sustainability (Holmberg et al., 2008). Consequently, students get better
    informed and prepared to deal with global issues, such as, food security, climate
    change, water management, non-renewable energy management, biodiversity, health
    and social inequality, and better prepared to face a sustainable future. For instance,
    Faham et al. (2017) showed an improvement in the educational behaviour pattern
    when integrating sustainability contents into curricula of the agriculture and
    natural resources disciplines from 1991 to 2011. 3. Materials and methods This
    work is the result of research developed under the frame of the SFARM - Sustainable
    Farming project (www.sfarm-project.eu), an ERASMUS + project. The European partners
    are universities from Greece, Italy and Portugal, and from Asia universities from
    China, Indonesia, Laos and Vietnam. The main goal of the SFARM is to develop new
    curricula for a MSc program in Sustainable Agriculture, that integrate the latest
    developments in agricultural applied research and with this contribute to improve
    the skills of academic staff, students and agricultural extension staff in the
    SFARM Asian HEIs and in general in the society. In particular, this study aims
    to identify the best practices in Sustainable Agriculture to be implemented in
    the MSc programmes of ESD. In order to accomplish the aim of this study, a questionnaire
    (Supplementary Material 1 – SM1) was prepared by the University of Évora (Portugal)
    with the contribution of Agricultural University of Athens (Greece) and University
    of Basilicata (Italy). This questionnaire concerning the agricultural sector was
    distributed to academics’ experts in Agrarian Sciences in Greece, Italy and Portugal,
    to record their opinion on the best practices to be adopt in a MSc programme in
    Sustainable Agriculture. The target audience is expected to be academic staff,
    students and agricultural extension staff (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res

    the questionnaires on the agricultural sector, to be answered by agrarian sciences
    experts, with the objective to identify the best practices to be included in MSc
    programmes in Sustainable Agriculture. The defined objective in the SFARM grant
    agreement was to have 90 questionnaires answered (30 in each country). However,
    only 72 were received which corresponds to an achievement of 80% of the initial
    goal predicted in this task. In Greece 22 questionnaires were completed, in Italy
    30 and in Portugal 20. The majority of the respondents in the three countries
    were male (70.8%) and the average age vary between 35.5 and 56.7 years old. The
    main objective of the questionnaire was to identify the best practices based on
    other similar questionnaires and ideas expressed in EISA (2012), such as: 1) Which
    are the fundamental expertise in a MSc programme on Sustainable Agriculture? 2)
    Which are the most important Sustainable Agriculture practices? 3) Which forms
    of training/learning are adequate? Theoretical, practical classes? Face-to-face,
    e-learning, b-learning? The questionnaire was divided in three parts: 1) Present
    and future of Sustainable Agriculture: a. Is there a widespread concern in your
    area regarding the practice of Sustainable Agriculture? Elaborate (Yes/No); b.
    Selection of the Sustainable Agriculture practices that already exist or/and are
    the future trend in your country; c. Grade the level of farmer’s expertise in
    your region; 2) Training needs on Sustainable Agriculture: a. Rate the importance
    of each expertise for the future of Sustainable Agriculture; b. What you think
    are the overall future training needs in Sustainable Agriculture; c. List the
    subject(s) in Sustainable Agriculture you think that is (are) important to be
    taught in a Master Level in Europe; d. Rate the forms of learning/training from
    not very applicable/not important to very applicable/important; e. How efficient
    you believe each training method is; 3) Personal data: a. Age; b. Gender; c. Expertise.
    The questionnaire answers were analysed by country and are presented in percentages
    to allow the comparison of the results between the countries. Table 1 shows the
    methodology defined for the analysis of the current practices, future trends,
    current level of farmers’ expertise, training needs, skills with future training
    needs, forms of learning/training, and training methods. Table 1. Methodology

    experts in agrarian sciences (academics) regarding the widespread concerns of
    Sustainable Agriculture in their regions. It can be seen that there is a widespread
    concern on practices of Sustainable Agriculture in the three countries. These
    concerns are mainly related with: i) climate change; ii) soil quality and resources;
    iii) water resources and management; iv) sustainable production; v) conservation
    agriculture; and vi) income (Table 2). Download : Download high-res image (150KB)

    Waste management Water management Nevertheless, some farmers were considered,
    by the experts, of not having enough know-how of these practices and/or being
    specially worried with the profitability of the production. In Greece, the majority
    of respondents said that farmers do not have enough knowledge in Sustainable Agriculture
    issues and most of the stakeholders’ focus on short-term profit, without taking
    into account the environmental impact and the sustainability of the farming systems.
    In Italy, one questionnaire considered that there is not a widespread concern
    regarding the practice of Sustainable Agriculture, because their productions -
    organic agriculture and integrated agriculture - are already regulated by the
    law. In Portugal, most respondents stated that, despite concerns about Sustainable
    Agriculture, some farmers are also focused on economic profitability. The SAP
    already present in the three European countries are sustainable crop rotation
    plan, crop protection management and soil management (Table 3). However, crop
    nutrient management and organic based fertilizers, integrated pest management
    and reuse of agricultural residues are in the border line and could almost be
    considered as practices present in European farms. Reduction of methane emissions
    from livestock and reduction of CO2 emissions from machinery and fuel use were
    considered to be practices with low expression in Southern Europe. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) is a SAP existent in Portugal, with low presence in Greece and in Italy.
    The low expression practices, identified among the respondents, have been considered
    to be the main drivers of climate change, i.e. reduction of CO2 emissions from
    machinery and fuel use and reduction of methane emissions from livestock. Table

    and management were mentioned. The lowest level of expertise was identified to
    be in climate change and air quality, and waste management and pollution control.
    These results revealed that academics view shows that in general farmers are experts
    in every aspect of crop and animal production but not in farming waste and pollutants
    management, or in climate change impacts and mitigation actions. Table 4. Level

    sustainable agricultural The main future trends of SAP identified were: management
    plan for efficient energy use, farm waste management, and energy production from
    biomass and liquid manure (Table 5). Although, the use of renewable energy, reduction
    of methane emissions from livestock, and PA may be also considered important future
    trend practices in European farms. Whilst water conservation and management was
    considered the SAP with lowest future trend. This can be due to the fact that
    water is already a concern for farmers, especially in the opinion of Italian and
    Portuguese academics’ expert. Table 5. Future trends in sustainable agricultural

    and GIS; 6) resources use efficiency (water, energy, nutrients, etc.); 7) soil
    management and conservation; 8) technological, economic, social and environment
    issues; 9) water management and conservation; and 10) crop and nutrient management
    (SM2). In addition, the future training methods require learning of new agronomical
    and environmental issues (Fig. 4). However, Greeks and Portuguese respondents
    strongly agree that management, and information and communication technology (ICT)
    skills are future training needs, while Italians respondents seem somehow less
    convinced that these skills require specific future training. Download : Download

    in Sustainable Agriculture by the academics of the three European countries were
    educational excursions/visits, field demonstrations, short-term seminars, practical
    courses/exercises and agriculturalist’s visits in farms (Table 7). These academics
    considered not efficient the training methods broadcasts on radio, information
    in the form of forms-brochures, television broadcasts and articles in newspaper.

    5.1. Fundamental expertise In this study it became clear that agricultural sector
    is aware of the importance of education in Sustainable Agriculture practices (Fig.
    2). To train properly the students, technicians and farmers in Sustainable Agriculture,
    it is important to provide critical knowledge and skills to enhance the productivity
    and sustainability (Patil and Kokate 2011). ESD in agriculture plays an important
    role in preparing academic staff, students and technicians for the changes and
    adaptations required for a sustainable agricultural production and to increase
    environmental protection and simultaneously meeting the farmer’s needs (McKeown
    et al., 2002). Recent developments in science and technology, that could be an
    added value to crop and land management, are still unutilized in many situations
    because farmers have not been introduced to them or have not been trained to use
    it. These is in accordance with the agrarian sciences experts when considering
    that some farmers do not have enough know how on SAP. Moreover, the main subjects
    related to Sustainable Agriculture identified (climate change, soil quality and
    resources, water resources and management, sustainable production, conservation
    agriculture, income; Table 2) were those that are causing a degree of concern
    and/or optimism in farmers, according to the political views, region and agricultural
    group. Based on Grimberg et al. (2018), the political view is the main driver
    for the perception of changes in the climate and the awareness of potential risks
    for agriculture, enhancing the use of adaptation and mitigation practices. Farmers
    are aware of climatic risks in agricultural systems due to the observation of
    local climate trends, the cultivated area and income (Arbuckle, Morton, and Hobbs
    2015; Doll, Petersen, and Bode 2017; Gauchat 2012). Thus, climate changes emerge
    as one of the serious threats to agricultural sustainability and the ability of
    food systems to provide adequate nutrition for a growing population. In addition,
    the identified subjects, by the agrarian science experts, are some of the important
    aspects to be considered for a sustainable production, which is in agreement with
    Grimberg et al. (2018). These authors showed the importance of designing sustainable
    agricultural programmes based on the farmers’ socio-ecological characteristics
    to reduce barriers for the adoption of climate-resilient agriculture. HEIs are
    aware of these and in the last years, environmental, economic and social subjects
    have been incorporating in agricultural courses. Sustainable agriculture/farming
    subjects considered as important in a MSc in Sustainable Agriculture (SM2), have
    been incorporated to undertake better research, improving teaching and support
    enhanced extension services in order to provide a more effective response to the
    many environmental and agriculture concerns related to the development of each
    country. For instance, six of the subjects are included in new specialized curricula
    and innovative MSc programme and training courses under the frame of two projects,
    i.e. SFARM - Sustainable Farming (http://www.sfarm-project.eu/) and SAGRI - Sustainable
    Agriculture (http://www.sagriproject.eu/). These courses provide knowledge, skills
    and competencies in the field of agro-environmental technologies for Sustainable
    Agriculture through a new curricula and teaching programmes that integrate, in
    a practical way, the latest developments in agricultural applied research (Picuno
    and Statuto 2018; 2017; Silva, Baptista, and Cruz 2017). 5.2. Important practices
    The important practices in Sustainable Agriculture identified as existent in Greece,
    Italy and Portugal, are mostly related to crop and animal production and management
    (Table 3), while the future trends in SAP are more focused on the efficient management
    of waste produced and the efficient resources (e.g. energy, water, etc.) use in
    crops and animal production (Table 5). The identification of these practices is
    in accordance with the level of knowledge of farmers, i.e. high knowledge in crop
    and animal production than in agricultural waste and energy efficiency (Table
    4). Thus, skilled agricultural workers are needed to understand how environmental
    sustainability is applicable to their everyday practice, e.g. managing pesticide
    and other chemical use, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using renewable energy,
    and managing water resources (European Commission 2015). Under this perspective,
    our results are in accordance with EU (2015) by showing that agricultural practices
    should change by adopting renewable energy sources and efficient energy use (Table
    5). Furthermore, the agricultural universities and colleges are leaving teaching
    unsustainable conventional agricultural practices and technologies linked to crop
    and livestock production, such as crop monoculture and heavy use of chemical inputs.
    The curricula of HEI include interdisciplinary courses of agricultural practices,
    technologies and systems linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation. PA
    is a good example of a course included in the curricula of MSc programmes in the
    scientific area of Sustainable Agriculture in some European HEIs, such as, in
    Portugal at the University of Évora in association with New University of Lisbon,
    and at University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro; in Greece at the University
    of Thessaly; and in Italy at the University of Padova and University of Perugia.
    The agrarian sciences experts agree with this assessment by considering PA and
    technology an important subject and expertise, to be included in the curricula
    (SM2), being an inter and multidisciplinary course that comprise practical experiences.
    Moreover, PA emerges as an important tool which incorporate recent advances in
    modern agriculture providing evidence for lower production costs, increase farming
    efficiency and reduce impacts (Koutsos and Menexes 2019; Hassall 2010). In this
    way, the use of this course in a MSc programme in Sustainable Agriculture will
    enable to acquire knowledge on new agro-environmental technologies, such as GIS,
    Remote Sensing, contributing, for example, to improve soil and irrigation management.
    Also, PA allow farmers to get economic and agronomic favourable results over conventional
    technologies by increasing yields and/or profitability in a sustainable and environmentally
    friendly way (Srinivasan 2006; Silva et al., 2007; Takács-György 2008). In this
    way, academic staff, students and agricultural extension staff will understand
    and apply new technologies related to primary production for both food and non-food
    uses, soil science, crop and livestock genetics, agri-chemicals and general purpose
    technologies such as remote sensors, satellites and robotics. Circular economy
    (CE) is another good example of a subject to be taken in consideration for a Sustainable
    Agriculture MSc. The traditional economy model is based on the intensive extraction
    of natural resources, which can have negative impacts on the environment. Based
    on the future SAP, expertise and important subject to be taught in a Master programme
    (Table 5, Fig. 3 and SM2), this problem may be overcome by applying the CE strategy.
    CE strategy aims to minimize resources extraction, maximizing reuse, increasing
    resources use efficiency, recovery and recycling (Stahel 2016) and help to decrease
    the threats to quality of life, to increase the development of adaptation and
    mitigation strategies, and hence minimize climate change (Arbuckle et al., 2015).
    For example, Wijkman and Skånberg (2015) reported that the change of five European
    countries to the CE has resulted, in some of them, a reduction up to 70% of GHG
    emissions and an increase of 4% of the workforce. On the other hand, CE, where
    products are recycled, reused, disassembled and remanufactured, may be one solution
    for farm waste management, and energy production from biomass and liquid manure
    (Wijkman and Skånberg 2015). In this way, farmers will know how to handle with
    the materials and substances resulting from the Sustainable Agriculture activities,
    which were previously considered to be waste and now become a resource by closing
    the loop and, consequently, reduce both resource consumption and discharges into
    the environment (Jurgilevich et al., 2016). Thus, it becomes clear the need of
    incorporating adaptive and mitigate practices, as those used in the CE, in the
    curricula of a MSc programme in Sustainable Agriculture. Since the CE strategy
    involves different scientific areas, a MSc programme in Sustainable Agriculture
    should include several courses that focus on mitigation strategies and resource
    use efficiency, as those identified as the important subjects in Sustainable Agriculture
    by the agrarian sciences experts (SM2). In this way, academic staff, students
    and agricultural extension staff, who attend the MSc programme, will improve their
    skills and acquire knowledge of the entire value chain, particularly on recycling,
    reuse, disassembly and remanufacturing, replacing the traditional linear model
    that dominated the economy until now. 5.3. Adequate training/learning methodologies
    Concerning the training/learning needs, traditional face-to-face training methods
    are considered more important forms of training/learning than online methods (Table
    6). This is in accordance with Parr et al. (2007) which showed that students learn
    better through experiences that link the classroom to field work, engaging a broad
    range of actors within applied settings. Their study also supports the argument
    that sustainable agricultural education requires progressive, integrated, experiential,
    interdisciplinary, systems-based curricula where learning grounds theory to practice
    in relevant and purposeful social and environmental contexts. On the other hand,
    Kowalska et al. (2016) showed that students acquire new competences, skills and
    sensitivity needs to develop actions towards an environmental education when close
    cooperation between schools and farms exist. This is in line with our results
    that showed practical classes, such as field excursions, visits and demonstrations
    in farms, as the most adequate training methods (Table 7). The importance of face-to-face
    education is clear in our results which are in disagreement with the new approaches
    and teaching methods used to facilitate ESD. However, with recent COVID-19 pandemic,
    HEIs are facing new teaching and learning challenges and many of them had to cancel
    all face-to-face classes and move to online courses. Although online training
    methods traditionally considered not suitable for a MSc programme in Sustainable
    Agriculture, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance provided by online
    education as an educational alternative to the traditional face-to-face learning.
    Therefore, academic staff, students and agricultural extension staff can proceed
    at home with their studies and teaching. Internet-based distance education offers
    more opportunities for international and intercultural learning (Barth and Rieckmann
    2008; Cörvers and De Kraker 2009) and modes of experiential and service learning
    that support stronger links between formal and informal learning settings (Brundiers
    and Wiek 2011; Sutheimer and Pyles 2011). In spite of this, online training methods
    in agriculture programmes should be seen as complementary tools and not as the
    main training methodology. COVID-19 pandemic also reinforced the usefulness and
    the quality of the ICT and technological tools as a basic need to effectively
    roll out online learning (Hodges et al., 2020; Ali 2020). Our results support
    the work of these authors when Greek and Portuguese academics identify the management
    and ICT skills as the future training needs (Fig. 4). Communication technology
    gives to academic staff, students and agricultural extension staff greater control
    over their access and exposure to information. Furthermore, the most widely used
    mobile data service worldwide and many services or equipment, such as text messaging,
    can provide real-time information and be very useful for farm management. For
    example, software can store digital evidence to be presented to national and EU
    agricultural regulators on the fulfilment of subsidy conditions, contributing
    for efficient management (European Commission 2014). 6. Conclusions The best practices
    identified for the HEIs curricula of MSc programmes in Sustainable Agriculture
    are the inclusion of interdisciplinary courses of agricultural practices (e.g.
    animal husbandry; pest management; soil, water, crop and animal management and
    conservation), technologies and systems (e.g. Remote Sensing and GIS) linked to
    climate change adaption and mitigation. These are the case of Precision Agriculture
    and courses focuses on mitigation strategies and resource use efficiency, as those
    off Circular Economy (i.e. resources use efficiency of water, energy and nutrients,
    farm waste management and energy production from biomass and liquid manure). In
    addition, future MSc programmes in Sustainable Agriculture will require high level
    of skills on new agronomic, environmental, management and ICT issues. For the
    training/learning methodologies the identified best practices are the use of traditional
    face-to-face, field and practical methods (e.g., excursions and visits to farms,
    seminars). However, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance provided
    by online education as a suitable alternative, that should be seen as a complementary
    tool. In conclusion, this study highlights the transformation needs in the MSc
    programme in Sustainable Agriculture in strong connection to the proposed training
    actions with the Agenda 2030 and the European Green Deal. Also, it shows that
    the new curricula to be developed should consider more flexible and resilient
    programs to face unpredictable future events, such as worldwide pandemics. CRediT

  description: The sustainable agriculture cultivation in greenhouses is constantly
    evolving thanks to new technologies and methodologies able to improve the crop
    yield and to solve the common con-cerns which occur in protected environments.
    In this paper, an MPC‐based control system has been realized in order to control
    the indoor air temperature in a high efficiency greenhouse. The main objective
    is to determine the optimal control signals related to the water mass flow rate
    supplied by a heat pump. The MPC model allows a predefined temperature profile
    to be tracked with an energy saving approach. The MPC has been implemented as
    a multiobjective optimization model that takes into account the dynamic behavior
    of the greenhouse in terms of energy and mass balances. The energy supply is provided
    by a ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) and by the solar radiation while the energy
    losses related to heat transfers across the glazed envelope. The proposed MPC
    method was applied in a smart innovative greenhouse located in Italy, and its
    performances were compared with a traditional reactive control method in terms
    of deviation of the indoor temperature in respect to the desired one and in terms
    of electric power consumption. The results demonstrated that, for a time horizon
    of 20 h, in a greenhouse with dimensions 15.3 and 9.9 m and an average height
    of 4.5 m, the proposed MPC approach saved about 30% in electric power compared
    with a relay control, guaranteeing a consistent and reliable temperature profile
    in respect to the predefined tracked one.

    is constantly evolving thanks to new technologies and methodologies able to improve

    In this paper, an MPC-based control system has been realized in order to control
    the indoor air temperature in a high efficiency greenhouse. The main objective
    is to determine the optimal control signals related to the water mass flow rate
    supplied by a heat pump. The MPC model allows a predefined temperature profile
    to be tracked with an energy saving approach. The MPC has been implemented as
    a multiobjective optimization model that takes into account the dynamic behavior
    of the greenhouse in terms of energy and mass balances. The energy supply is provided
    by a ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) and by the solar radiation while the energy
    losses related to heat transfers across the glazed envelope. The proposed MPC
    method was applied in a smart innovative greenhouse located in Italy, and its
    performances were compared with a traditional reactive control method in terms
    of deviation of the indoor temperature in respect to the desired one and in terms

    greenhouse energy modeling; precision agriculture 1. Introduction Due to the significant
    climate changes occurred in the last decades, the introduction of new methodologies
    and technologies has become essential to support agriculture and to optimize greenhouse
    productions. In the last decades, vegetables and fruit cultivation has become
    more and more competitive—above all, in the Mediterranean area. According to Eurostat
    statistics [1], in the EU, the agricultural production in 2016 used the 39% of
    the land area of the EU countries, while, in 2017, the agriculture sector concurred
    for 1.2% of the EU’s GDP [2]. New approaches adopted in agriculture have been
    suggested in Agriculture 4.0, which reflects the main features of the Fourth Industrial
    Revolution (Industry 4.0) promoted by Germany and other European countries [3].
    The main goals of this ongoing revolution concern the introduction of the automation
    and digital technologies in the agriculture sector favoring a transition toward
    smart and sustainable farming systems. In this context, Agriculture 4.0 represents
    a great opportunity to take into account the variability and uncertainties involving
    the agri-food production chain, especially due to the costumers’ inconstancy or
    in fighting emergency situations such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [4].
    The main innovative technologies able to support this transition include the Internet
    of Things (IoT) [5], Artificial Intelligence (AI) [6], remote sensing and new
    applications in intelligent control and the automation of production processes
    [7]. The IoT and remote sensing applications have recently been implemented to
    monitor and control indoor greenhouse parameters [8,9], to optimize the irrigation
    system automation [10], to monitor crop sensitive data and provide the farmer
    with real-time information about performance in order to take correct decisions
    [11], to detect plant diseases using image evaluation [12] and to control the
    lighting system [13] or nutrient optimal levels in the soil [14]. A review about
    IoT applications in smart agriculture appeared in reference [15]. One of the main
    significant smart farming approaches is represented by Precision Agriculture (PA)—above
    all, in the protected environment [16]. PA, in fact, is based on ICT solutions
    to monitor, measure and control inside parameters in order to increase productivity
    by minimizing the environmental impact, allowing cost and water saving and reducing
    disease infection and pesticide adoptions [17]. Smart agriculture and PA applied
    to greenhouses are also a very interesting from an energy viewpoint. In fact,
    the growing request of quality and production of fruits and vegetables imposes
    to the producer to equip greenhouses with suitable heating and cooling units to
    regulate the temperature, humidity and lighting, driving a healthy and controlled
    production. In smart applications, in general, it is mandatory to select proper
    high-efficiency technical solutions to reduce the energy consumption and, as a
    consequence, the production costs [18]. A critical point is the economic sustainability
    of this type of production, especially in the global market; even excellent quality
    products are not competitive when their price is too high. Therefore, the greenhouse
    agriculture is more and more investing in technologies, passing from traditional
    to ICT-controlled systems, resulting in a “smart” greenhouse environment. In this
    context, the work proposed in this paper encompasses two main interesting features
    related to the recent literature dedicated to greenhouse cultivation. Firstly,
    it refers to the basic principle of Agriculture 4.0 focusing on the control strategy
    to optimize the microclimate inside a smart greenhouse realized by using innovative
    materials and technologies and monitored by advanced control systems. Secondly,
    a MPC application is used as the relevant control strategy to guarantee a reliable
    tracking of specific target temperature, which may assure the optimal environmental
    conditions for the correct growth of each selected plant with an energy-saving
    approach. In detail, this paper presents the development of an MPC-based control
    system to optimize the indoor air temperature of a smart greenhouse according
    to the requirements of the specific crop cultivation. The aim of this work is
    to determine the optimal control signals associated with the water mass flow rate
    supplied by a heat pump following the a priori known temperature profile. A multiobjective
    optimization model based on the MPC approach has been implemented, taking into
    account the dynamic behavior of the greenhouse in terms of the energy and mass
    balances. The energy supply is provided by a ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) and
    by the solar radiation, while the energy losses are related to heat transfers
    across the glazed envelope. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. Several
    works concern the greenhouse microclimate control, but limited literature is dedicated
    to the control of the heating cooling system realized by the geothermal system
    in greenhouses. Generally, GCHPs are applied in the context of commercial or residential
    buildings due to their energy efficiency, while few works refer to this application
    in greenhouses, especially with MPC-based control. The successfully use of GCHPs
    in greenhouses has been already verified, even in Italy [19], and the wide literature
    has demonstrated the advantages of the MPC approach in respect to other control
    models also in the greenhouse climate management [20], but no papers, according
    to the authors’ knowledge, have tackled the problem to control the GCHP by MPC
    tracking optimal indoor greenhouse temperatures, minimizing the electrical energy
    consumption. The main novelty of this paper is related to the application of the
    MPC to optimize the water mass flow rate in the GCHP system, comparing its performances
    with a reactive control. The second main interesting feature is related to the
    experimental test site. The greenhouse, the subject of this work, was financed
    and realized by an Italian national program that allowed selecting and adopting
    the main interesting materials and emerging technologies. The opportunity to test
    our control model in a such an advanced context represented an added value of
    our work. The proposed MPC method was applied in a smart innovative greenhouse
    located in Italy. The goal was to demonstrate that the application of the proposed
    model yielded better energy performances in comparison with traditional reactive
    controls. This paper is related to an innovative regional research later exploited
    in an international context. The “Smart Agro-Manufacturing Laboratory (SAM-LAB)”
    project was developed in 2014–2016 in the framework of a Regional Italian project,
    funded by the Liguria Region PAR FAS program. The main aim of the SAM LAB project
    was to define the strategies enhancing greenhouse management in order to improve
    the cultivation systems and reduce the overall required energy. Based on this
    experience, the Interreg ALCOTRA project between Italy and France funded the Antea
    project “Edible Flowers: Innovations for the Development of a Cross-Border Sector”
    (2016–2020). The project aim was to support innovation to promote the nutritional
    characteristics of edible flowers and broaden the range of varieties, setting
    up an innovative production, commercialization and consumption system for the
    product. The link between the two projects was the realization and operation monitoring
    of an innovative prototype greenhouse at Cersaa (Center for Agricultural Experimentation
    and Assistance) in Albenga, Italy (Figure 1). Cersaa and Unige share the research
    facility. Figure 1. Innovative greenhouse realized at Cersaa (Center for Agricultural
    Experimentation and Assistance) in Albenga, Liguria Region, Italy. The light in
    the greenhouse is the result of a low-consumption lighting system based on LED
    technology. The greenhouse is equipped with new materials for the glazed envelope,
    innovative equipment associated to renewable energies and suitable advanced ICT
    monitoring and control systems. The greenhouse was tested for several experiences
    from the technological and methodological viewpoints. Among such experiences,
    heating and cooling the greenhouse tracking a specific temperature profile may
    represent a perfect example where the Model Predictive Control (MPC) can give
    a better performance when compared to traditional relay controls. The MPC represents
    one of the most powerful approaches to iteratively optimizing complex dynamic
    systems in the current sampling time, taking into account the prediction of system
    state in the future. The use of the MPC in this work is motivated by the ability
    of this control strategy to significantly improve the control performance when
    a desired trajectory has to be tracked. The MPC basic concept, in fact, deals
    with predicting the evolution of the state, the input and the output of a system,
    subjected to constraints, on a given prediction horizon, minimizing the cost function,
    which determines the best control decision. However, only the values obtained
    in the first interval are used, while the procedure is repeated for the following
    sampling times by the receding horizon approach. In this work, after a survey
    of the current challenges in greenhouse production, a MPC approach is presented
    and compared with the traditional control solution. The MPC is implemented as
    a multiobjective optimization model to find the optimal control signals associated
    to the hot water flow in the heating plant. 2. Smart Greenhouses Applications
    Recently, new alternative cultivation techniques and greenhouse systems have been
    developed to support crop production in the perspective of unfavorable environmental
    conditions, especially in areas where conventional farming systems are difficult
    to be applied. The Nemo’s Garden project (2012–2020), for example, developed an
    underwater farm that consisted of six biospheres made by acrylic material completely
    immersed in the sea, at 5–12-m depth, at 100 m from the shoreline, close to Savona,
    in Liguria Region, Italy [21]. This application focused on the creation of a self-sustainable
    farming aimed at freshwater production, comfortable stable temperature and isolation
    of the greenhouse environment from external contamination and external air weather
    conditions. The water cycle inside the underwater greenhouse depends on different
    parameters, such as the vapor partial pressure and the temperature inside the
    air volume, the radiation and the surface temperatures, the sea temperature, the
    vapor removal by specific heat exchangers and the plant watering system. In reference
    [22], Zeidler et al. described the design of a technological greenhouse dedicated
    to the lunar space applications. In fact, the project aimed at developing a closed-loop
    bioregenerative life support system, essential for future human space missions,
    with the realization of a lunar greenhouse system able to produce specific quantities
    of selected plants. In arid areas or in countries with limited rainfall, the development
    of a seawater desalination plant based on a renewable energy system (RES) is becoming
    a significant added value for the protected agriculture. An interesting example
    are desalination units based on a renewable hybrid system using sunlight and seawater
    that are able to humidify the indoor air of the greenhouse and to produce fresh
    water [23]. In a confined environment such as a greenhouse, the requirement of
    controlled internal conditions for a long time operation determines an increasing
    energy consumption, which represents a problem both for the environmental and
    the economic viewpoints. One of the main concerns in a greenhouse management is
    the energy cost associated with heating and cooling duties [24]. In reference
    [25], the authors proposed a survey and a performance evaluation of innovative
    and renewable heating technologies for greenhouse applications. Different energy
    saving solutions were presented, with special reference to thermal storage techniques,
    ground-to-air heat exchanger systems, solutions for insulation/thermal screens,
    the optimal use of a north wall, ground air collectors and aquifer-coupled cavity
    flow heat exchanger systems. Besides, in reference [26], the researchers proposed
    a comprehensive report of cooling methods for greenhouses, including renewable
    technologies such as roof evaporative cooling, the ground-to-air heat exchanger
    system and the aquifer-coupled cavity flow heat exchanger system. In reference
    [27], the authors analyzed the statistical performance of a microclimatic model
    for a naturally ventilated greenhouse for a cucumber crop based on the heat and
    mass transport processes. Priarone et al. [28] evaluated the energy demand of
    the greenhouse by an hourly numerical simulation realized by Energy Plus (E-plus)
    software. In order to minimize the energy produced by fossil fuel, the introduction
    of devices based on renewable sources such as geothermal heat pumps represent
    the first step to decreasing harmful emissions [28,29]. Heating/cooling systems
    affect, significantly, the growth, the quality and the cultivation time in greenhouses
    [30]. In particular, the indoor environmental parameters in a greenhouse must
    be monitored and controlled to support crop growth [31]. Greenhouse heating is
    a central issue even in countries with mild climates, such as in the Mediterranean
    area, but cooling operations are also necessary to maximize the crop production
    and drive the timing for crops. Heating and cooling costs seriously affect the
    economic profits but, in the long term, may also limit a large diffusion of the
    greenhouse cultivations. In general, energy costs account for up to 40% of final
    production costs in a greenhouse [32]. Moreover, high-energy consumption heating
    systems may generate the emission of noxious gases that produce environmental
    problems. Geothermal (ground-source or water-source) heat pumps represent one
    of the most important green energy solutions to realize a heating or cooling system
    for domestic and industry applications [33]. Ground-coupled heat pumps (GCHPs)
    work extracting/injecting heat from/to the ground in order to heat or cool the
    indoor environment, typically thanks to vertical ground heat exchangers [34].
    This technology takes advantage of the fact that the ground, from some 10 m down
    on, maintains an almost constant and warm temperature during the year. Several
    studies have focused on the implementation of RES-based integrated systems for
    energy production and storage technologies [35,36], describing technologies and
    the optimal energy management of greenhouses [37]. According to the above-cited
    literature, the current trend to realize smart greenhouses at zero-net energy
    is becoming one of a viable technological solution to support sustainable food
    production and an alternative strategy to fossil fuel energy production. In this
    innovative context, in the following section, the description of a real application
    of smart greenhouse realized in Italy is introduced. 2.1. Technologies for an
    Innovative Smart Greenhouse in Italy This paper focuses on the performance of
    an innovative greenhouse realized in Albenga, Liguria Region, Italy. The greenhouse
    envelope was a rectangular aluminum frame with a pitched roof. The base dimensions
    were 15.3 and 9.9 m, while the eave height was 3.50 m, with a roof top of 5.60
    m. Glazed walls with low emissivity K-glass type N with a thickness of 4 mm were
    used for the greenhouse structure. They were characterized by a heat transfer
    coefficient of 3.3 W/m2K, normal emissivity equal to 0.05 and a solar gain (g-value)
    of 71%. The greenhouse was equipped with innovative solutions for energy consumption
    reduction and the maximization of the productivity of the selected crop. The air
    conditioning system of the greenhouse was able to control the indoor temperature
    both in the winter and summer seasons. In addition, other quantities were monitored
    (humidity, irradiance level and photosynthetically active radiation; PAR), and
    additional equipment (reflective shading) was used for tuning the inner radiation.
    A complete EnergyPlus model of this greenhouse was recently developed in reference
    [38], for further details on the structure characteristics, operating conditions
    and energy transfers. In the present greenhouse, reflective shading was applied
    to the roof surface to reduce during summer the heating contribution due to the
    solar gain. Another passive technique to reduce the internal temperature was natural
    ventilation by controlled opening of windows, located at the bottom of the lateral
    walls and at the roof top, which measured 30 m2. If the air volumetric flow rate
    obtained by natural ventilation (wind and stack effects) was not enough, an extractor
    fan was activated on the rooftop. Finally, in the case of peak conditions, the
    internal temperature and humidity thresholds were controlled by means of an air
    handling unit (AHU) to optimize the cooling and heating processes. The AHU was
    associated with a ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) extracting or injecting heat
    into the ground thanks to six borehole heat exchangers (double-U pipes, 100m deep
    each). The local undisturbed ground temperature at the site was about 16 °C (60.8
    °F). Worth noticing, this value was more helpful for both the heating and cooling
    operations than the corresponding air temperatures, ranging from 9 °C to 35 °C
    from the winter to summer. The selected GCHP (model Ecogeo B3 of the Ecoforest
    brand) has a nominal heating capacity at a partial load factor (PLF) = 95% of
    28 kW for the inlet water temperature Tin = 10 °C and outlet water temperature
    Tout = 55 °C, with a COP (Coefficient of Performance) = 3.7; during the summer
    season, the nominal cooling capacity was at PLF = 100% of 34.4 kW for Tin = 20
    °C and Tout = 7 °C, with a EER (energy efficiency ratio) = 5.29. At the load side,
    the heat pump (HP) provides water to a storage tank (ST). The storage tank feeds,
    in turn, the coils of the AHU and, also, the local heater of the benches placed
    inside the greenhouse for crop purposes. The AHU is an AERMEC brand, series TN
    2 with a nominal air volumetric flow rate equal to 4100 m3/h in cooling mode and
    4700 m3/h in heating mode. The estimated overall heat transfer coefficient of
    the AHU was HTC = 760 W/K. The air distribution network was composed of three
    textile ducts by AIRMIXING Evoair. The water tank was thermally stratified, due
    to the different densities of water related to its temperatures: the hot water
    coming from the GCHP enters the tank from the top, while the cooler water coming
    back from the air heat exchanger settles in the tank bottom section. The storage
    tank capacity of storing heat while maintaining the highest level of energy derives
    from the real temperature stratification conditions that depend on many factors,
    including the tank size, height and diameter; flow rate for loading and unloading
    water and water velocities at inlet sections [39]. Reference [40] investigated
    the thermal stratification in hot water tanks. The greenhouse was equipped with
    a monitoring and control system based on four subsystems with peculiar features.
    The hardware system, built as a sensor network, has the task to measure and track
    each parameter of the greenhouse and to send the data to a control unit (CU).
    The software system acquires data from the CU, collects and displays the data
    and verifies the parameters of the greenhouse environment. The control system
    communicates with different actuators of the greenhouse structure according to
    the observed parameters in order to set the optimal conditions required to cope
    with the design set points. Finally, a website was implemented, devoted to the
    real-time visualization of the greenhouse parameters and to generate downloadable
    reports of historical measured records. 2.1.1. Sensor Network The hardware system
    was based on an embedded CU, version A20-OLinuXino-MICRO-4GB, a local network
    of analogical and digital sensors that can monitor in real time each parameter
    of the greenhouse. In this configuration, the control system was equipped with
    GPRS technology. The devices installed in the greenhouse can monitor the following
    parameters: external weather conditions (temperature, wind speed and direction
    and humidity); indoor air temperature, pressure and humidity at different heights
    inside the greenhouse; light and photon flux inside the greenhouse; soil humidity
    and temperature; photovoltaic energy production; geothermal heat pump performance
    power and heat transfer rates. The digital thermometer provided 9-bit to 12-bit
    Celsius temperature measurements, and it included a user-settable alarm for the
    upper and lower trigger points. Its operating temperature ranged from −55 °C to
    +125 °C, with a ±0.5 °C accuracy in the range from −10 °C to +85 °C. The digital
    barometric pressure sensor, which included a conditioning IC, made available accurate
    pressure measurements in a range of 50 to 115 kPa. The lux meter measured the
    illuminance of natural or artificial light sources, with a measuring cell that
    returned an electrical output signal (0–10 V or 4–20 mA) proportional to the light
    intensity. Moreover, in order to track and set a convenient water irrigation schedule,
    a water flow meter was installed in the irrigation system. All the sensors were
    individually calibrated and tested. The sensor network transmission system was
    based on a single-wire bus for a serial communication with a central microprocessor
    that used only one data line (and ground). 2.1.2. Software System and Website
    Module The CU performs activities related to measurement collection, partial data
    processing and message packing on multiple queues. The CU acquires different kinds
    of data from the network sensors, and it transmits them to the control center
    server according to different methods. All data are typically acquired at predefined
    fixed time intervals (e.g., 5 min). The data transmission rate can be changed
    between two predefined modes by fixed sample times or by on-event requests. According
    to the first mode, the data were periodically sent with the information about
    the greenhouse parameters while, according to the second mode, the measurements
    were sent, for example, in case of detected anomalies or whenever the received
    values overcame the threshold defined by the control system. It is possible to
    define an unlimited number of notifications by means of one or several communication
    protocols (e.g., email, SMS messaging and website alert messages). 2.1.3. Control
    System The data acquired by the CU are periodically sent by a GPRS connection
    to the Control Center and forwarded to a dedicated internet server. If any parameter
    of the network system does not satisfy the optimal predefined conditions, an alert
    message is generated. At the same time, the CU sets the corresponding actuators
    of the greenhouse in order to modify their status. Specifically, the CU can operate
    on the following structural elements of the greenhouse: opening/closure of the
    shading system, opening/closure of the lateral side and roof windows, switch on/switch
    off the heating and cooling system, switch on/switch off the irrigation system
    and switch on/switch off the lighting system. The classic approach to control
    in automatic these systems is usually based on relay strategies (e.g., for temperature,
    switching on the HP when the temperature is below a specific value) or on periodic
    automations (e.g., for irrigation, switching it on at fixed flows at a specific
    hour of the day). 2.1.4. Heat Pump Energy Monitoring An additional monitoring
    system was dedicated to record the operating parameters of the GCHP. The system
    was based on a Linux micropc platform that controls an acquisition unit able to
    collect, at sampling rates higher than 1 Hz, a series of analogical and digital
    inputs. The measured quantities included evaporator and condenser side temperatures,
    carrier fluid temperatures from the different borehole heat exchangers, a mass
    flow rate in the ground loop and electrical power at the heat pump compressor
    and circulation pump. The aim of these measurements was to track the heat pump
    energy performance in real time and to build a database of the working parameters.
    3. Overview in MPC Method for Greenhouse Efficiency The main challenge in greenhouse
    management is microclimate control during different seasons to fit the optimal
    crop growing conditions. In particular, temperature control is essential to create
    the best values for the overall parameters inside the greenhouse environment to
    avoid plant stress and to improve the efficiency of crop production. Several research
    studies have tackled the problem and provided different control methods and models
    for the indoor temperatures of greenhouses. In general, the quality of control
    strategies depends on the data availability about the variability of the parameters
    that may affect the actuators choice and the control signals [41]. Usually, the
    control strategies in the context of a greenhouse are mainly based on the traditional
    reactive methods or on predictive models. The traditional reactive control strategies
    do not take into account the forecast of the state and environmental exogenous
    variables [42]. On the other hand, these approaches based either on on/off relay
    methods or on proportional, integral and derivative (P, PI or PID) controllers
    have a widespread use due to their simple architecture and easy implementation
    [43]. Due to the complex mass and heat transfer processes in the greenhouse environment,
    the implementation of an on/off controller produces, in this kind of application,
    significant fluctuation of the variables from their input set points [44]. In
    reference [45], a PID and fuzzy logic controllers were implemented to minimize
    water use and optimize the energy consumption, while, in reference [46], the authors
    proposed a PID tuning scheme for greenhouse climate control by an evolutionary
    algorithm. Therefore, in some applications, the PID controller can generate promising
    results, but, when the operating conditions differ largely from the optimal ones,
    a controller calibration process has to be included in decreasing the control
    performances [47]. Besides, PID control does not usually represent a suitable
    solution in case of advanced applications, whereas dynamic controls are essential
    [48]. On the other hand, Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods receive considerable
    interest in research studies, with applications for different economic and industrial
    sectors thanks to their robustness and ability to model disturbances and nonlinear
    constraints [49]. In fact, recently, the MPC was extensively used in different
    kinds of specific applications: vehicle platoon control [50,51,52], in the management
    of transport flows [53], microgrid energy management [54,55], in chemical processes
    [56] or in the control of the thermal comfort in indoor environments [57,58].
    MPC is an advanced control technique that adopts a process model to forecast the
    future variable behaviors. This approach allows to model complex systems and processes
    that require receiving control signals in the short term by an optimal automated
    model predictive controller. In the case of systems with fast dynamics, other
    constraint control approaches may be adopted. In reference [59], Hosseinzadeh
    et al. introduced the Explicit Reference Governor scheme for continuous-time systems,
    which guaranteed that the system states were constrained in a specified range.
    Other approaches refer to the control barrier functions (CBFs), which has been
    significantly applied, above all, in the context of safety and critical control
    conditions [60] or to the safety preserving control algorithm, where the system
    was forced to remain within the constraint invariant set [61]. Specific literature
    has been devoted to MPC methods applied to control different components of a greenhouse
    [62]. In references [63,64], the authors implemented an optimal strategy to regulate
    the operational parameters for heating and cooling systems by means of an MPC.
    In particular, in reference [63], the authors proposed a Generalized Predictive
    Control (GPC) applied to two types of heating systems in a greenhouse: an aerial
    pipe with hot water and air-fan heaters were tested for greenhouse temperature
    control. Comparing the GPC and on/off controllers, they concluded that the advantages
    of using GPC with respect to a traditional controller are only apparent if the
    operating greenhouse conditions violate the constraints about a minimum inside
    temperature. In reference [64], a multiobjective hierarchical control model was
    implemented to maximize the economic profits, crop quality and water use efficiency
    in greenhouse cultivation. In reference [65], the authors proposed a MPC strategy
    to control the air temperature within a greenhouse using a particle swarm optimization
    algorithm. In reference [66], the authors presented a MPC controller able to maximize
    the crop photosynthesis acting on the water and energy management, while, in reference
    [67], the MPC adoption in an irrigation system reduced 30% of the water consumption
    over a period of three weeks. Serale et al. in reference [68], implemented a MPC
    strategy to control the artificial lighting system to optimize the energy efficiency.
    In reference [69], a MPC approach was used to control the air temperature in a
    greenhouse managing two variables associated with heating pipe temperature and
    the air volumetric flow rate (windows opening). In other papers, the authors adopted
    the MPC algorithm in order to optimize the greenhouse climatic conditions by minimizing
    the energy and water uses [70] and by controlling the natural ventilation [71],
    CO2 concentration [72] or the fan behaviors [73]. Moreover, further approaches
    may be introduced to improve the performances of the control strategies in terms
    of scalability and reconfigurability [57]. In this context, the authors in reference
    [58] proposed a lexicographic multiobjective optimization based on prioritized
    objectives, while, in reference [74], an improved multiobjective genetic algorithm
    was adopted to optimize the indoor thermal comfort of buildings. In references
    [20,48,75], interesting reviews were discussed about the application of MPC in
    a greenhouse context. Thus, in most papers, the control models aim at optimizing
    the behavior of the greenhouse environment, minimizing the heating or cooling
    energy and/or reference deviation for one of the main significant parameters,
    such as the temperature or humidity, through actuators such as window opening/closing,
    heating valve position or signals for ventilation and heating/cooling systems.
    These concepts play an important role in the remainder of this paper. This work
    presents the design of an MPC-based model to control indoor air temperatures in
    a greenhouse by optimizing three different objective functions. In detail, it
    considers the aims of minimizing the activation of the GCHP during the time horizon,
    minimizing the energy consumption associated with the use of the heating system
    and, finally, minimizing the maximum deviation of the inside greenhouse temperature
    with respect to the desired one for each time interval. The main contribution
    of this paper is to show the application of a simple and effective MPC model that
    allows the greenhouse system to track a predefined temperature profile (specific
    for each crop cultivation) with an energy-saving approach. A multiobjective function
    is defined to obtain the control law in the proposed MPC algorithm and to determine
    the optimal control signals associated with the water mass flow rate supplied
    by the heating pump. Other constraints about physical limits and heat exchanges
    are taken into account in the overall process control systems. 4. The Proposed
    MPC Model This model aims at controlling the indoor temperature of a greenhouse
    by tracking a predefined value, minimizing the energy efficiency of the heating
    system. The proposed architecture consists of the following components. For heating
    and cooling purposes, the GCHP is connected to an Air Handling Unit (AHU), fed
    by hot (or cold) water. As it is well-known, the COP (Coefficient of Performance)
    refers to the ratio between the units of heating energy generated for every unit
    of electrical energy spent to operate the system [38]. It is assumed that the
    ventilation system operates in the greenhouse in full mixing mode, producing a
    homogeneous temperature inside the greenhouse. A sensor network is considered
    to monitor, in real time, the following parameters: the external air temperature
    and the solar radiation, the air temperature inside the greenhouse, the benches
    and the cultivation soil temperature and the temperatures and flow rate of the
    water on the condenser side of the GCHP (inlet and outlet). A module to predict
    the outdoor weather condition is considered as well. Figure 2 shows a sketch of
    the actual heating and cooling system, which includes a storage tank. Nevertheless,
    the following proposed preliminary version of the MPC model does not include the
    tank in the analysis and assumes that the GCHP feeds directly into the AHU. This
    assumption is based on the fact that the size of the storage is small compared
    to the typical flow rates, and its role is mainly to decouple the upstream and
    downstream flows other than storing energy. Therefore, the model may be formalized
    by considering the following set of parameters and variables computed for each
    time interval i of the time horizon I, where I = 1, …, I. Figure 2. Greenhouse

    to limit discontinuities in the power feeding the HP, limiting the HP straining.
    The second objective OBJ2 aims at minimizing the electric power 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖 during

    by minimizing the maximum value of deviation between the current indoor temperature

    (10) 𝑚 ̂ 𝑖 < 𝑚 ̂ 𝑀𝐴𝑋  𝑖=1,..,𝐼−1 (11) In the above set of equations, Equations
    (2) and (3) represent the energy balances for greenhouse air (of temperature 𝑇
    𝑔 𝑖 ) and internal masses (of average temperature 𝑇 𝑚 𝑖𝑛𝑡 𝑖 ), respectively. In
    particular, Equation (2) shows the relationship between the state variables associated
    to indoor greenhouse temperature 𝑇 𝑔 𝑖 and the others main components due to internal
    and external variables. The superscripts g, e, mint refer to the variables related
    to the temperatures, respectively, associated to the greenhouse, to the external
    conditions and to the inner masses. The main contributions are due to the heat
    losses through the glazed envelope, the heat transfer between air and the internal
    masses of the greenhouse, the solar gains and the heat provided by the plant by
    means of the AHU. This energy balance is intrinsically time-dependent, because
    the external air temperature 𝑇 𝑒 𝑖 and the solar irradiance 𝐺 𝑠𝑜𝑙 𝑖 change continuously
    during the day, depending on the season. Equation (4) allows to evaluate the evolution
    in time of the water temperature at the load side of the GCHP (the stream that
    exits from the heating coil of the AHU). On the contrary, due to the peculiar
    characteristics of the greenhouse site (the presence of a double aquifer at some
    10 and 80-m depths, respectively) measured values of the carried liquid temperature,
    the ground side was demonstrated to be very constant in time, and this is the
    reason for setting it as a constant in the present model. In Equation (4), the
    estimated heat transfer coefficient of heat exchanger water/air in the AHU is
    considered; in fact, the decrease of water temperature ( 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖 − 𝑇 𝑖𝑛 𝑖 ) is
    proportional to the heat transferred to the air in the AHU heating coil 𝑄 𝑖 ,
    evaluated as in Equation (7). Equation (5) is the definition of the performance
    parameter COP for the GCHP. Due to numerical constraints, the 𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 variable
    has been top-limited by the value in Equation (6). The range of the GCHP efficiency
    depends on the hot water temperature exiting from the heat pump 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖 and from
    the temperature 𝑇 𝑔𝑒𝑜 of the water coming from the ground, respectively. The variable
    𝑄 𝑖 is defined in Equation (7) by the heat transfer formula, which is the measure
    of the thermal energy transferred by the GCHP water according to the outlet and
    inlet water temperature variations. In detail, the heating power of GCHP is given
    by the product of the mass flow rate of the water circulating in the pipe and
    the related specific heat of water and the temperature difference. Equations (8)
    and (9) introduce a maximum threshold for the variables associated with 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖
    and 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖 due to physical and numerical constraints. In Equation (10), the value
    of 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖 , (i.e., the supply temperature of the GCHP) is forced to be ∆Temp
    over 𝑇 𝑖𝑛 𝑖 , the temperature of water returning from the greenhouse if the pump
    is activated, or to be equal to 𝑇 𝑖𝑛 𝑖 otherwise. Finally, Equation (11) represents
    an upper limit for the variable associated to the mass flow rate of the water
    circulating in the GCHP pipe. 5. Case Study 5.1. Model Application The proposed
    model was tested to simulate and control the air temperature inside the aforementioned
    SamLab greenhouse located in the town of Albenga, Liguria Region, Italy. In the
    proposed case study, the effective regulation of the heating system was implemented
    by simply minimizing the difference between the current internal air temperature
    condition and the optimal set point, considering a time interval of 20 h. The
    input for the MPC model was the outside air temperature and the solar irradiance,
    whereas the state variable, with values to be tracked for each time interval,
    was the indoor air temperature of the greenhouse. In the proposed approach, the
    temperature of the internal masses of the greenhouse were taken into account,
    because in the transient analysis, their heat capacity could not be neglected.
    In particular, the cultivation benches (account for some 7 tons as a whole) and
    greenhouse walls were taken into account as a fraction of the overall envelope
    mass to properly account for the twin heat transfer contributions, the one towards
    the external air (that follows the weather variability) and the one towards the
    indoor air of the greenhouse. Finally, the heat transfer with the bottom ground
    (greenhouse floor) was neglected. The parameters taken into account are presented
    in Table 1. Table 1. Parameters of the problem. 5.2. Results In order to evaluate
    the performance model, the prediction horizon considered was 20 h with a 3-min
    sampling period (∆I = 180 s) and 400 time intervals. For the MPC application,
    the predicted values of the external temperature and solar irradiance were computed
    by the interpolation of real hourly data coming from the monitoring system for
    a day of May at the greenhouse location (Albenga, Liguria Region, Italy). Figure
    3 and Figure 4 display the main results of the model application. For this solution,
    the weighted parameters in the objective function were α = 0.1, β = 0.5 and γ
    = 350. Those values came from the tuning phase where the parameters were set empirically
    to compare the objectives according to the scale of the problem. In the following
    section, a sensitivity analysis was realized by varying the parameter γ to compare
    the proposed method performances with respect to the OBJ2 and OBJ3. Figure 3.
    Input and state variables associated with the temperature in the MPC approach.
    Figure 4. State and additional variables associated with the temperature in the
    MPC approach. The optimal tracking of the temperature set points along the time
    horizon is displayed. During the daily cycle, the proposed MPC model continuously
    monitored and controlled the inside temperature, which remained approximately
    close to the optimal tracking one, allowing the GCHP to operate nearer to its
    maximum efficiency (Figure 5). Figure 5. 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖  vs.  𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 values in the MPC
    approach. In Figure 6, the compressor power 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖 and the useful heat transfer
    𝑄 𝑖 of the GCHP are displayed according to the control variables. The maximum
    value for 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖 is about 2800 W. The efficiency of the GCHP is shown in Figure
    6 in terms of the 𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 , associated to the temperature of the water exiting
    from the HP and feeding the AHU. As one can expect, if the fluid temperature at
    the load side decreases, the HP condenser temperature decreases, and this implies
    an increase of the 𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 . Moreover, it is necessary to consider the peculiar
    formula employed in the present model that accounts for the 𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 limited at
    a maximum value equal to 6. The results highlighted that the possibility to take
    into account a reliable expected value of the outdoor climate conditions might
    produce significant improvements of the system performance with a reduction of
    the energy consumption. In the first time intervals, the water temperature of
    the GCHP load side (both inlet and outlet) decreased because the heating system
    started switched-off and turned on immediately, producing a quick increase of
    the water temperature. Figure 6. 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖 ,  𝑄 𝑖 and control variable values 𝑚 ̂
    𝑖 in the MPC approach. 5.3. MPC Method and Reactive Method Performance Comparison
    In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed control model, a comparison
    between the MPC approach vs. a classical reactive method is presented. To implement
    a simple reactive control method, the Objective Function (Equation (1d)) of the
    proposed MPC model was replaced by the following equation: 𝑚 ̂ 𝑖 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   𝑐𝑟𝑡
    𝑖𝑓 ( 𝑇 𝑔 𝑖 < 𝑇 𝑔 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑖 )  0 𝑖𝑓 ( 𝑇 𝑔 𝑖 ≥ 𝑇 𝑔 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑖 ) ⎫ ⎭ ⎬   (12) This constraint
    forces the activation of the GCHP when the inside controlled temperature 𝑇 𝑔 𝑖
    is lower than the tracking value 𝑇 𝑔 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑖 for each specific time interval.
    In the same way, if the inside temperature exceeds the set point, the GCHP is
    switched off. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show exactly the same variables as Figure
    3 and Figure 4, for an easy comparison of the different behaviors. The high-frequency
    oscillations in the temperature values that appear in Figure 7 and Figure 8 are
    generated by the use of the classical reactive method, which implies switching
    on and off the GCHP consecutively, producing a significant variation in the water
    temperature. Figure 7. Input and state variables associated with the temperature
    in reactive approach ( 𝑐𝑟𝑡=1) . Figure 8. State and additional variables associated
    with the temperature in the reactive approach (𝑐𝑟𝑡=1) . In fact, the trend of
    the examined parameters for the case of a simple reactive control method speedily
    fluctuate, because the system is continuously switched on/off to track the desired
    setpoint value 𝑇 𝑔 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑖 . A great electrical energy saving in the MPC approach
    results from the comparison between the behavior of 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖 using the reactive
    approach in Figure 9 and using the MPC method in Figure 5. Figure 9. 𝑃𝑒 𝑙 𝑖 and
    𝑚 ̂ 𝑖 values in the reactive approach. From the analysis of Figure 10 and the
    comparison with Figure 6, it is interesting to note that the MPC control allows
    the system to work at higher values of the 𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 , because it is able to maintain
    the system at a lower temperature 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖 , around 312 K. Figure 10. 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖  vs.
    𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 values in the relay approach. On the contrary, the reactive control works
    at a higher temperature 𝑇 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑖 , which reaches about 323 K. As a consequence,
    the system controlled using the proposed MPC method exhibits a reduction of the
    electrical power consumption (comparison between Figure 5 and Figure 9) that leads
    to lower costs of operation. Figure 11 presents the direct comparison of the 𝐶𝑂
    𝑃 𝑖 values for the two approaches. Figure 11. 𝐶𝑂 𝑃 𝑖 values in the MPC vs. reactive
    methods (RM). In Figure 12, the behavior of the state variables 𝑇 𝑔 𝑖 associated
    with the indoor temperature are displayed for different values of the parameter
    𝛾 in the MPC and of parameter crt in the reactive method (RM). Imposing small
    values of the control parameter 𝑐𝑟𝑡 in the reactive method, Equation (12), the
    𝑇 𝑔 𝑖 fluctuation is reduced in time and in extension (see, as an example, 𝑇 𝑔
    𝑖 in RM for 𝑐𝑟𝑡 = 0.2). In those cases, the HP activation is reduced, decreasing
    the energy consumption but, also, leading to a failure in keeping track of the
    temperature during most of the time horizon. Besides, the comparison between the
    MPC approach and reactive method performance was carried out by varying the weighted
    parameters in the multiobjective optimization control model. In particular, the
    controller design based on the weighted sums of the three objectives in the optimization
    model was decomposed in its components. The two approaches were evaluated with
    respect to the second (OBJ2, Equation (1b)) and the third objectives (OBJ3, Equation
    (1c)), respectively, associated with the minimization of the electric power 𝑃𝑒
    𝑙 𝑖 and the minimization of the maximum value of deviation between the current
    indoor air temperature in the greenhouse and the target one. Figure 12. MPC vs.
    the reactive method performances in comparison with respect to the tracking of
    the indoor temperature 𝑇 𝑔 𝑖 . Thus, to evaluate the tradeoff between energy saving
    (OBJ2) and tracking costs (OBJ 3) in the MPC approach, the parameter 𝛾 in Equation
    (1d) was modulated, while, in the reactive method, the parameter 𝑐𝑟𝑡 in Equation
    (12) was varied according to the range of feasible values. The resulting Pareto
    optimal solutions in Figure 13 shows that the reactive control was dominated by
    the MPC method. Figure 13. MPC vs. the reactive method performance comparison.
    Different solutions for the MPC and reactive approaches are compared as a function
    of two opposite terms in the objective function. 6. Conclusions In this work,
    using a MPC methodology whose cost function minimizes three different objectives,
    a model was implemented to optimize the energy saving in a greenhouse. In particular,
    the aim was to control the flow rate of hot water generated by a heating system
    in order to trace the optimal indoor temperature specific for a crop cultivation.
    The MPC was applied to a nonlinear model for the optimal management of the microclimatic
    internal parameters of the greenhouse, taking into account the energy exchanges
    and the physical constraints of each component. By the MPC, the controller showed
    a rapid output tracking, and only a small fluctuation appeared in the first-time
    intervals with respect to the optimal trajectory of the desired temperature. In
    the proposed MPC, the weighted parameters in the objective function were set to
    continuously track the desired temperature in the protected cultivation environment
    (OBJ3). This choice significantly reduced the deviation between the current and
    target indoor temperatures, with better performance of the MPC for almost 85%
    with respect to the reactive method over a time horizon of 20 h. Besides, from
    the energy consumption viewpoint, the MPC represented the best solution in terms
    of energy saving. As appeared in Figure 13, for comparable values of the temperature
    deviation (OBJ3), the MPC used lower electric power 𝑃𝑒𝑙 than the reactive method
    (OBJ2). In the best case, for 𝛾=550 and 𝑐𝑟𝑡=1.3 , the MPC allowed saving about
    31% of the electric power with respect to the on/off control. The main interesting
    feature of the proposed multiobjective approach was the possibility to separately
    weigh the objectives in the cost function in order to obtain the solution that
    best fits with the decision-maker’s requirements. If the farmer decides that the
    main purpose of his/her control process addresses the energy saving with respect
    to temperature tracking, which assures the quality of the crop growth environment,
    the main parameters of the objective may be enlarged to enforce that the related
    costs might prevail in the minimization problem. MPC tuning was examined with
    several values of weighted parameters in the multiobjective cost function to achieve
    the optimal setting for the controller’s performance. Subsequently, a classical
    relay control was applied to the same model. The parameters of the on/off controller
    were varied, and the results were compared with those obtained using the MPC controller
    in terms of the two components of the cost function that were the minimization
    of the electric power consumption and the divergence of the indoor air temperature
    with respect to the predefined one. The results indicated that the Pareto front
    associated with the MPC controller dominated the relay control one in all simulations.

    Common agricultural pest and pathogen management practices are reliant on agrochemicals
    (pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers), drugs and synthetic materials that

    applications 1. Introduction Global climate change is predicted to result in increases
    in droughts, pests, climate-related diseases and variability in crop yield in
    the decades ahead (Adams et al., 2012; Alexander et al., 2018; FAO, 2017, R. Miller
    et al., 2002; U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global
    Change Research, 2008; Rosenzweig et al., 2001; Shuman, 2011; Tripathi et al.,
    2016; Wang et al., 2018). At present, the global forecast predicts a population
    increase to 9.8 million by 2050 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social
    Affairs, Population Division, 2017), and it has been predicted that to feed our
    growing population, a 70–100% increase in food supply is required (Godfray et
    al., 2010). The implications of global climate change and increase in world population
    will greatly impact existing issues and create new challenges and demands in the
    agrifoods (agricultural and food) sector. New innovative tools are required to
    improve agricultural productivity and provide sustainable alternatives to existing
    practices. The interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology will be a significant
    part of transforming the agrifoods sector through the design of next generation
    tools that support precision and sustainable agriculture growth (Pandey, 2020;
    Prasad et al., 2017). Over the last few decades, the field of nanotechnology has
    rapidly progressed, with advances in the field leading to innovations with biotechnology
    applications (Orive et al., 2004; Razzacki et al., 2004). Nanoparticles are a
    class of material with a size range of 1–1000 nm in length in at least one dimension
    (Jeevanandam et al., 2018). The background research and application of nanoparticles
    in biomedicine has the potential to be transferred to the agricultural sector.
    Many nanoparticles have a diameter range between 10 and 1000 nm and are comprised
    of inorganic (e.g. metal, polymers) or organic (e.g. lipids, polymers) materials
    (Griffin et al., 2017; IS, 2013). Engineered and natural nanoparticles, with their
    greater to surface area to volume ratio, have improved the bioavailability of
    cargo substances and provided an alternative to safely deliver drugs to specific
    targets in the body. These advantages have led to the increasing use of nanoparticles
    in the biomedical field for delivering drugs and for treating diseases in humans
    (Kawasaki and Player, 2005; Lombardo et al., 2019; Rudramurthy and Swamy, 2018;
    Sun et al., 2014). The application of nanoparticles in biomedicine has revealed
    the benefits for technology transfer, as there are a multitude of uses for nanoparticles
    in the agrifoods sector. In agriculture and food production, nanoparticles have
    the potential to enhance growth, combat diseases and pathogens, protect food sources,
    reduce waste and minimize environmental harm. Nanoparticles packaged with chemical
    and drugs (antibiotics, agrochemicals –fertilizers/pesticides/herbicides) or biomolecules
    (lipids, nucleotides, proteins and peptides) could be utilized in plants, livestock
    and aquaculture. Presently, nanoparticles have been investigated as a method to
    deliver agrochemicals and nutrients more efficiently to improve soil quality and
    stimulate plant growth (Corradini, 2010; Delfani et al., 2014; Fraceto et al.,
    2016; Ghafariyan et al., 2013; Wu and Liu, 2008). Alternatively, nanoparticles
    can be used to deliver hormones, vaccines or antibiotics that can inhibit pathogens
    or deliver health benefits to the plant (Thangavelu et al., 2018), fish (Rather
    et al., 2013; Shaalan et al., 2016), or animal (Bai et al., 2018; Cui and Mumper,
    2001; Fondevila et al., 2009; MacLeod and Prescott, 1988). Nanoparticles have
    additionally been used as nanosensors to detect chemicals or foodborne pathogens
    (Bülbül et al., 2015; MacLeod and Prescott, 1988; Stephen Inbaraj and Chen, 2016;
    Sung et al., 2013), as well as for the removal of chemicals and pathogens from
    food sources (El-Boubbou et al., 2007; Fernandez et al., 2010; Hlongwane et al.,
    2019; Ko et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2014). Nanoparticles could become a “game
    changer” technology for the agrifoods industry sector, and as there are both synthetic
    and biological types of nanoparticles, there are opportunities to develop adaptable,
    non-toxic and environmentally sustainable tools. The development and choice of
    nanoparticles for the agrifoods sector will depend on the application; therefore,
    a review of the current systems, purposes, safety and potential environmental
    impacts of the common types of nanoparticles (e.g. metal, polymeric, biological
    sourced and lipids) (Fig. 1) will further raise awareness among end-users and
    influence acceptance by consumers. Download : Download high-res image (655KB)

    review was conducted in a similar manner to Xue et al. (2020). This method was
    adopted as a way to summarize and analyze the history, status and developments
    of the use of nanoparticles in the agricultural sector. The steps involved in
    this literature review consisted of 1) an initial search based on keywords, 2)
    a filtering step based on the title, keywords and abstract, 3) analysis of the
    article, and 4) final search based on a snowball of the references in the relevant
    articles. When performing the literature review, basic guidelines were set to
    minimize deviation from the aim of the review and publication bias. An initial
    search was done using relevant keywords such as “nanoparticle, delivery vehicle,
    sensor, agriculture, carrier, encapsulation, toxicity, and nanoparticle application”
    through the PubMed.gov, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Following
    an initial search, articles were filtered based on the title and the relation
    of the abstract to the topic. The main body of the selected articles were then
    analyzed for information aligned with the use of nanoparticles as a form of delivery,
    encapsulation and sensor technology. The snowballing technique was then used on
    the references of these selected articles and to perform expanded keyword search
    aligned with the types of nanoparticles (e.g. metal – gold and silver, polymeric,
    biological nanovesicles – liposomes, bacteria, milk and plants) and their application.
    Following the final search, articles pertaining to the scope and objective of
    the review were identified and collected to narrow the research into a manageable
    framework. 3. Results: Analysis of nanoparticles 3.1. Metal nanoparticles The
    study of nanoparticle application in veterinary medicine, agriculture and food
    science is a dynamic area of scientific research (Bai et al., 2018; Chen, 2018;
    Das et al., 2017; Shaalan et al., 2016). The focus has been on several types of
    metal nanoparticles, particularly silver, gold, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide
    nanoparticles, as they offer a novel alternative for conventional antimicrobials
    to combat the problem of microbial resistance, though this is dependent on the
    size and concentration of the nanoparticle (Gunalan et al., 2012; Kumar and Anthony,
    2016; Mohd Yusof et al., 2019; Seil and Webster, 2012). Owing to these and other
    well-known properties, metal nanoparticles (Fig. 1A) have applications in precision
    agricultural practices in the areas of pest management, as fertilizers, biosensors,
    wastewater treatments, environmental remediation, and crop ripening agents (Duhan
    et al., 2017; Yan and Chen, 2019). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are among the
    most studied metal nanoparticles as prospective antibacterial agents. The antibacterial
    action of AgNPs is via multiple mechanisms, decreasing the likelihood or delaying
    the development of bacterial resistance (Knetsch and Koole, 2011). There are several
    theories regarding the antibacterial mechanisms of action for silver nanoparticles.
    One mechanism involves the release of silver ions (Ag+), leading to Ag+ binding
    to the bacterial cell membrane thereby causing its disruption and eventually bacterial
    cell death. Additionally, Ag+ ions influence metabolic processes by inactivating
    enzymes, binding intracellularly to cytochrome and bacterial nucleic acids, and
    inhibiting cell division of bacteria (Prabhu and Poulose, 2012; Shaalan et al.,
    2017, 2018). Due to the reported antibacterial activity, AgNPs have been used
    as an option for the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacterial isolates such
    as multidrug-resistant Salmonella, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
    (MRSA) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, and erythromycin-resistant
    Streptococcus pyogenes (Ayala-Núñez et al., 2009; Farouk et al., 2020; Lara et
    al., 2010; Prakash et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2017a). The broad-spectrum antimicrobial
    activity of silver nanoparticles against a range of multi-drug resistant pathogens
    is the result of the nanoparticles inhibiting cell wall, protein and nucleic acid
    synthesis in the pathogen (Lara et al., 2010). To enhance the effects of silver
    nanoparticles, a combinational therapy approach with antibiotics has been trialed
    in the veterinary field. A strong synergistic antimicrobial effect was observed
    for silver nanoparticles used in combination with penicillin G against the animal
    pathogens Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. and Pasteurella multocida (Smekalova
    et al., 2016). A combinational approach appeared to increase sensitivity to antibiotics
    in these pathogens that were resistant to other classes of antibiotics (e.g. gentamicin,
    colistin and amoxycillin), indicating that this strategy could be used an adjuvant
    in livestock (Smekalova et al., 2016). The antibacterial activities of metal nanoparticles
    are influenced by the size, shape, charge and material composition. However, not
    only do metal nanoparticles demonstrate antibacterial effects, but studies have
    shown they can inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as fungi, parasites,
    and viruses. As a result, silver nanoparticles have been introduced into pet shampoo,
    ointments and soaps (Bansod et al., 2015). Silver nanoparticles have shown potent
    antifungal inhibitory action against the pathogenic keratinophylic dermatophyte
    fungi (Ayatollahi Mousavi et al., 2015), strains of Candida spp. (Mallmann et
    al., 2015; Panáček et al., 2009) and various plant phytopathogenic fungi (Elamawi
    et al., 2018; Gopinath and Velusamy, 2013; Mishra et al., 2014). In terms of antiparasitic
    actions, these nanoparticles have been reported to be effective against ticks
    in cattle (Rajakumar and Abdul Rahuman, 2012) and mosquitos that are potential
    carriers of many infectious pathogens (Benelli, 2016; Govindarajan et al., 2017).
    Silver nanoparticles also exhibit antiviral properties; for example, a chitosan-silver
    nanocomposite has been shown to be effective against H1N1 influenza virus via
    binding to the viral envelope glycoproteins, thereby preventing virus entry into
    the host cells (Mori et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2011). Moreover, silver nanoparticles
    were found to be effective, in vitro, against a Morbillivirus that infects small
    ruminants, the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) (Khandelwal et al., 2014).
    PPRV is endemic in Asia and Africa where, as a result of climate and coverage
    conditions, a live attenuated vaccine programme has not been successful in halting
    the viral spread, with AgNPs offering an alternative form of control (Khandelwal
    et al., 2014). Silver nanoparticles have likewise been used to reduce the virus
    infectivity of the bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1) that causes diseases worldwide
    in cattle (El-Mohamady et al., 2018). Because of its broad-spectrum antiviral
    activities, it was investigated if biosynthesized silver nanoparticles from Eucalyptus
    procera could be introduced into the rabies vaccine as an immunostimulatory adjuvant
    (Asgary et al., 2016). The 15 mg/kg AgNPs-loaded vaccine was not toxic to mice
    and had a NIH potency of 1.303, comparable to that of the alum-containing vaccine
    (1.897) (Asgary et al., 2016). The use of gold nanoparticles with similar antiviral
    activities as vaccine adjuvants was further explored for the foot and mouth disease
    virus (FMDV) (Chen et al., 2010; Rafiei et al., 2016). A synthetic peptide similar
    to the FMDV protein was conjugated to gold nanoparticles to create an adjuvant,
    with nanoparticles ranging from 8 to 17 nm in diameter being most efficient at
    stimulating maximal antibody responses (Chen et al., 2010). The work of Raifei
    et al. (2016) further supported these findings, and they reported that gold nanoparticles
    impaired the replication of FMDV, causing a 4-fold change in virus titer, and
    hence gold nanoparticles were incorporated into a FMD vaccine as an immunostimulatory
    adjuvant. There is great interest in investigating the biomedical applications
    of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) because of their antibacterial properties and relative
    low toxicity to eukaryotic cells (Li et al., 2014). Gold nanoparticles have demonstrated
    bactericidal activity with the pathogenic strains Escherichia coli and Salmonella
    typhimurium (Lima et al., 2013). Functionalized cationic and hydrophobic gold
    nanoparticles have an inhibitory effect on the growth of over 11 Gram positive
    and negative multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacterial isolates (Li et al.,
    2014). It was only after 20 generations that bacterial resistance occurred, indicating
    that gold nanoparticles may offer a long-term strategy for treating bacterial
    infections. There are three mechanisms of antimicrobial action for gold nanoparticles;
    the first is through changing the potential of the bacterial cell membrane, thus
    interfering with the oxidative phosphorylation in the cell, leading to a decrease
    in ATP synthesis and metabolism. The second mechanism is through interfering with
    the binding of tRNA to ribosomal subunits. The third mechanism is chemotaxis enhancement
    (Cui et al., 2012). Fungicidal activity of gold nanoparticles has been reported
    for fungal pathogens such as Candida spp. The antifungal properties of gold nanoparticles
    appear to be size dependent, with the high surface area 25-nm particles (179.5
    m2/g) more strongly inhibiting fungal growth than the 30-nm (150.5 m2/g) particles.
    The increased surface area of the 23-nm nanoparticles would allow for greater
    interactions of the nanoparticle with the binding sites of plasma membrane proteins
    present on the fungus, enhancing antifungal activity (Ahmad et al., 2013; Wani
    and Ahmad, 2013). The use of gold nanoparticles as biosensors has been demonstrated
    for the rapid and sensitive detection of multiple veterinary pathogens. Pathogens
    that have been detected using gold nanoparticle-based probes include porcine reproductive
    and respiratory syndrome virus, blue tongue virus, and FMDV in ruminants (Ayala-Núñez
    et al., 2009; Hamdy et al., 2018; Nurulfiza et al., 2011; Saxena et al., 2012;
    Stringer et al., 2008). Biosensors using DNA-functionalized AuNPs offer a faster
    way to detect pathogens in areas with limited resources and in non-laboratory
    environments and sites, in comparison to standard and expensive molecular polymerase
    chain reaction (PCR) laboratory techniques. For example, a gold nanoparticle colorimetric
    assay combined with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique was
    developed as a next generation detection platform for the white spot syndrome
    virus in shrimp in field conditions (Seetang-Nun et al., 2013). As well as detecting
    pathogens, AuNPs have been used as biosensors to detect and monitor levels of
    toxins, heavy metals and pollutants in the environment and food sources (Chao
    and Chenxu, 2013; Yan et al., 2019). The target specificity and detection sensitivity
    of AuNP biosensors can be improved with the addition of recognition oligonucleotide
    or peptide molecules known as aptamers. Yan et al. (2019) created such an aptamer-AuNP
    biosensor, and with the addition of a fluorescent dye they were able to quantify
    the concentration of a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ofloxacin, in milk
    samples. Other than AgNPs and AuNPs, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) have drawn
    a great deal of attention because of their potential antimicrobial, antineoplastic,
    wound healing, ultraviolet scattering and angiogenic activities (Raguvaran et
    al., 2015). Zinc oxide nanoparticles are the third most commonly used of the types
    of metal materials available, with approximately between 550 and 33400 tons of
    ZnO-NPs produced globally per year (Faizan et al., 2020). ZnO-NPs have a potent
    antibacterial action on many foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella
    typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus, and thus could be used in food packaging
    material to increase shelf-life (Raguvaran et al., 2015; Tayel et al., 2011).
    The antibacterial activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles is attributed to the production
    of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that causes damage to the bacterial cell membrane,
    resulting in leakage of the cell’s cytoplasmic contents and eventual cell death
    (Sirelkhatim et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2006). Additionally, ZnO-NPs interact with
    sulfur- and phosphorus-containing intracellular components, causing protein damage
    thus disturbing cellular functions (Raguvaran et al., 2015). These nanoparticles
    are also reported to impair the growth of different bacteria and fungi such as
    Aspergillus flavus, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Citrobacter spp., E. coli,
    Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (Jayaseelan
    et al., 2012; Swain et al., 2014; Tayel et al., 2011). When examined against fish
    pathogens, ZnO-NPs inhibited the growth of many pathogens including Aeromonas
    hydrophila, A. salmonicida, Aphanomyces invadans, Edwardseilla tarda, Flavobacterium
    branchiophilum, Vibrio spp. and Yersinia ruckeri (Shaalan et al., 2017, 2018;
    Swain et al., 2014). Whereas the inclusion of ZnO-NPs in chicken rations was reported
    to enhance the absorptive capacity of intestine and improve the growth performance
    of broilers (Fathi et al., 2016; Hafez et al., 2020; Mahmoud et al., 2020). Zinc
    is an essential mineral, and agricultural soils that are alkaline with calcium
    carbonate often suffer from zinc deficiency (Duhan et al., 2017). Zinc oxide nanoparticles
    could be used as fertilizers to improve zinc root uptake and availability to plants
    grown in zinc-deficient soils. The application of ZnO-NPs chelated with the zinc
    supplement zinc sulfate enhanced growth, flowering and seed germination of the
    groundnut Arachis hypogaea L (Prasad et al., 2012). These positive effects have
    been observed in alfalfa, tomato (Guadalupe de la et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013),
    cucumber (Zhao et al., 2013), soya bean (Priester et al., 2012), green bean (Mukherjee
    et al., 2014) and wheat (Dimkpa et al., 2020). Again, the effects of these metal
    nanoparticles are dependent on the concentration and size of the ZnO-NP (refer
    to Faizan et al., 2020 for a summary of ZnO-NP on plant growth). Gold nanoparticles
    may similarly act as potential nano-fertilizers, producing a positive impact on
    a population of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) (Shashi Kant et al.,
    2015). Of the metal nanoparticles, zinc and titanium dioxide are known to be ultraviolet
    light (UV) blockers and as such are used in sunscreen formulations (Smijs and
    Pavel, 2011). Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs), are reported in the literature
    for their photoprotective and photocatalytic roles, giving rise to many industrial
    applications that include plant protection, environmental remediation (Bessa da
    Silva et al., 2016; Guerra et al., 2018; Singh and Lee, 2016), and antibacterial
    actions (Lyu et al., 2017). When adopted with magnetic Fe3O4-NPs, and with the
    aid of light activation, they exhibit bactericidal activity on E. tarda and Streptococcus
    iniae (Cheng et al., 2009). Independently, iron oxide (e.g. Fe3O4 (magnetite)
    and γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite)) nanoparticles have demonstrable antimicrobial activity
    in their nanoparticle form against antibiotic-resistant E. coli (Arakha et al.,
    2015), fungi (Salem et al., 2019), and biofilm formation (Sathyanarayanan et al.,
    2013). As a beneficial element for plant growth, titanium can enhance iron uptake,
    with the usage of TiO2-NPs found to promote plant growth in canola (Brassica napus)
    (Mahmoodzadeh et al., 2013) and tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) (Song et al.,
    2013). Despite their promising applications in the agricultural sector (Table
    1), a cause of concern is that these metal nanoparticles may be detrimental to
    the environment and human safety. Global annual production of metal nanoparticles
    has been estimated to grow up to nearly 585,000 metric tons in 2019 (BBCResearch,
    2014; Faizan et al., 2020). Several studies have indicated that the amounts of
    metal nanoparticles in the environment, as in the case of ZnO-NPs, range from
    3.1 to 31 μg/kg in the soil to 76–760 μg/L in water (Boxall et al., 2007; Faizan
    et al., 2020; Ghosh et al., 2016). Prior to the large-scale agricultural application
    of metal nanoparticles, careful consideration is required regarding where the
    metal nanoparticles will accumulate in the environment. Global life cycle assessments
    have indicated the possibility that 63–91% of the 260,000–309,000 metric tons
    engineered nanomaterial material produced ends up in landfills, with 8–28% accrued
    in soil, 0.4–7% in water bodies and 0.1–1.5% in the atmosphere (Keller et al.,
    2013). It would be important to learn about the accumulation quantities and effects
    on humans due to exposure from the environment, food packaging, cosmetics and
    food products. Table 1. Metal-based nanoparticles and applications in the agricultural

    Metal nanoparticles are utilized as drug carriers, biosensors, gene delivery vehicles,
    for bioimaging purposes, and to target and inhibit pathogens, in the biomedical
    field. These applications can be readily transferred to the agricultural sector
    to offer a new range of tools for precision and sustainable practices. Production
    of metal nanoparticles incorporate physical top-down methods where bulk metals
    are fractionated into smaller pieces. Alternatively, the chemical bottom-up method
    (e.g. precipitation method, vapor transport method, and hydrothermal process)
    includes the use of harmful organic solvents and toxic chemicals (Kalpana and
    Devi Rajeswari, 2018). The extensive range of applications for metal nanoparticles
    in the biomedical, food safety and agricultural sectors has led to the search
    for eco-friendly production techniques that enable large-scale production of materials
    without the use of toxic chemicals. When using natural sources to synthesize metal
    nanoparticles, the solvent medium and the reducing and stabilizing agents used
    need to be evaluated for toxicity and environmental effects (Kalpana and Devi
    Rajeswari, 2018). “Green” source materials such as microorganisms (e.g. bacteria,
    fungus, algae) and plant extracts have been successfully used to rapidly synthesize
    metal nanoparticles in an eco-friendly manner (Kalpana and Devi Rajeswari, 2018;
    Prakash et al., 2013). The techniques for biosynthesis using plant materials are
    relatively simple, and involve adding the desired metal precursor solution in
    a dropwise manner to a heated solution of leaf extracts that will act as reducing
    and capping agents (Kalpana and Devi Rajeswari, 2018; Prakash et al., 2013; Vanathi
    et al., 2014). As the biocompatibility, stability, toxicity and safety profiles
    for eco-friendly green synthesized metal nanoparticles improve, their application
    in the agricultural sector could be more widespread. However, a prerequisite for
    applying these tools to the field is that the degradability, toxicity, and importantly
    the fate and behaviour of these nanoparticles in the ecosystem and food supply
    chain are systematically investigated (Donia and Carbone, 2019; García-Gómez et
    al., 2017). 3.2. Polymeric nanoparticles Engineered polymeric nanoparticles are
    synthesized by physical, chemical, biological or hybrid methods under controlled
    or artificial environments (Jeevanandam et al., 2018). Engineered synthetic polymeric
    nanoparticles (Fig. 1B) were developed to increase integrity, improve structure
    and function of existing materials, and impart additional properties beneficial
    towards their targeted application (Table 2) (Shakiba et al., 2020). Nanoparticle
    synthesis is carried out by tuning and adjusting the sizes, shapes, morphologies,
    structures, surface properties and chemical compositions (Jeevanandam et al.,
    2018; Sun et al., 2014). The fabrication techniques for synthetic polymeric nanoparticles
    encompass mechanical grinding, multiple stages, heating treatment and advanced
    techniques such as emulsification, precipitation, polymerization, oxidoreduction
    and ionic gelation (Liu et al., 2008; Yearla and Padmasree, 2016). Table 2. Polymeric

    A prime objective in sustainable agricultural practices is to improve agrochemical

    polymeric nanoparticles to enable the slow and constant release of the active
    substances near or through the plant tissues and cuticles (Pérez-de-Luque and

    (Ahmad et al., 2020; Doane, 1992; Maruyama et al., 2016a; Shakiba et al., 2020;
    Silva et al., 2011; Sipponen et al., 2019). The nanostructures were designed to
    preserve material integrity, to be loaded with active ingredients for time-release
    applications, or to serve as encapsulation vehicles for poorly soluble active
    materials. This way, potential toxic effects on the surrounding environment and
    non-target organisms could be diminished. PLGA are synthetic polymers used in
    the biomedical field to improve the bioavailability of compounds like curcumin
    to treat cancer (Azandeh et al., 2017). The polymers of PLGA degrade into the
    nontoxic products of H2O and CO2, which are readily eliminated from the body (Swider
    et al., 2018). In the agrifoods sector, PLGA nanoparticles have been used to encapsulate
    the widely used herbicide atarzine with an efficiency ranging from 31.6% to 50.5%
    to create a slow-release herbicide system that minimizes environmental and human
    harm (Chen and Wang, 2019). The size of the nanoparticles influences the release
    rates, with comparisons showing that the smaller 250-nm nanoparticle reached the
    cumulative release rate of 75% at 96 h, far longer than the 500-nm nanoparticles
    (48 h) and the pure compound (8 h) (Chen and Wang, 2019). Polylactic (PLA) is
    a chemically synthesized biodegradable biopolymer often employed in food packaging
    applications. This biopolymer can be combined with poly β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)
    as a way to enhance its properties and functions for mechanical resistance and
    barrier performance (Arrieta et al., 2017). A PLA matrix has previously been used
    to encapsulate the herbicide metazachlor to control grass and weeds in crops such
    as soybean and potatoes. Three sizes of PLA particles (0.6, 0.8 and 8 μm) were
    examined, with encapsulation efficiencies noted to be poor for the smaller nanoparticles,
    while reaching up to 60% for the larger sized particles (Stloukal et al., 2012).
    The release profile of the PLA nanoparticles loaded with 30% w/w metazachlor were
    monitored for 30 days, with the size found to affect the release profile. Smaller
    nanoparticles appeared to release the herbicide in an initial burst, while a diffusion-controlled
    process occurred for the larger microparticles (Stloukal et al., 2012). PHB has
    also been used to engineer particles for the slow controlled release of herbicides,
    to minimize the toxic effects. The diffusion process release of ametryn, a s-triazine
    herbicide, encapsulated in ∼5–6 μm microparticles was slowed by 75% (Grillo et
    al., 2011). This polymer, which can be produced by bacteria and has low water
    solubility (Sakthiselvan and Madhumathi, 2018), was likewise investigated as a
    coating for urea granules to improve the retention of macro and micronutrients,
    and to develop a slow controlled release system for fertilizers (Costa et al.,
    2013). Synthetic engineered nanoparticles have additional functions besides delivering
    encapsulated agrochemicals and compounds. These polymeric materials can be used
    for the detection and removal of contaminants such as heavy metal chemicals, gases,
    organic pollutants and biological pathogens (Guerra et al., 2018). Amphiphilic
    polyurethane (APU) nanoparticles were reported for use in the remediation of soil
    contaminated with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of hydrophobic
    organic groundwater contaminants. The synthesized APU nanoparticles were of colloidal
    size (17–97 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering) and had modifiable properties
    (Tungittiplakorn et al., 2004). The hydrophobic interior region of the APU nanoparticle
    conferred a high affinity for the PAH phenanthrene (PHEN), causing an 80% recovery
    of contaminated aquifer sand, while its hydrophilic surface promoted particle
    mobility in soil (Tungittiplakorn et al., 2004). In terms of wastewater remediation,
    the application of poly (amidoamine) or dendrimers (PAMAM) has shown promise for
    water contaminated with metals such as Cu2+ (Guerra et al., 2018). The various
    primary amines, carboxylate and hydroxamate functional groups of these polymers
    can be used to chelate and ultrafiltrate metal ions to purify the water source
    (Ge et al., 2012), while the globular shape and low polydispersity of these polymers
    provides them with the ability to pass through ultrafiltration membrane pores.
    In addition, altering the pH acidity of the solution can facilitate the removal
    of the contaminants, and allow for the separation of the nanoparticles for recycling
    purposes (Biricova and Laznickova, 2009). Polymeric nanoparticles can similarly
    be designed to encapsulate volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with an amine functional
    group addition to the surface of PLA-PEG polymeric nanoparticles enabling the
    capture and up to 98% removal of VOCs with aldehyde and carboxylic acid functional
    groups in the gas phase (Guerra et al., 2018). Although synthetic polymeric nanoparticles
    may have beneficial uses in the controlled delivery and release of agrochemicals,
    contaminant detection and remediation, there are concerns regarding their application.
    Information regarding the biodegradability and bioaccumulation, as well as possible
    health and ecological effects of these polymeric nanoparticles (also known as
    nanoplastics) is presently being discovered (Gangadoo et al., 2020; Oliveri Conti
    et al., 2020). Furthermore, the high cost of synthetic polymeric materials can
    result in difficulties for commercial scaling purposes, particularly in the agriculture
    sector where large quantities are needed. As a result there has been a focus on
    engineering nanoparticles from natural materials. Chitosan is a promising natural
    polymer material commonly used for engineered nanoparticles in agricultural and
    veterinary practice, due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability properties.
    Silva et al. (2011) developed a chitosan-alginate system as a carrier for paraquat,
    one of the most widely used herbicides. The chitosan-alginate nanoparticles had
    an average diameter of 635 nm and encapsulation efficiency of 74.2% (Silva et
    al., 2011). Alternatively, a system composed of chitosan and tripolyphosphate
    nanoparticles (average size of 300 nm) was used to deliver the quick acting and
    non-selective paraquat herbicide (Grillo et al., 2014). The encapsulation efficiency
    reached 62% and the results indicate that the encapsulated herbicide was as effective
    as the free form but with a slower release profile of 70% of herbicide release
    after 350 min, compared with the 92% release profile of free herbicide (Grillo
    et al., 2014). Moreover, alginate/chitosan (CS/ALG) and chitosan/tripolyphosphate
    (CS/TPP) nanoparticles, with an average size of 400 nm, were developed for the
    encapsulation of the herbicides imazapic and imazapyr (Maruyama et al., 2016a).
    These nanoparticles demonstrated encapsulation efficiencies of between 50 and
    70% and remained stable during 30 days of storage at ambient temperature. Cytotoxicity
    assays showed that the CS/ALG and CS/TPP nanoparticles encapsulated herbicides
    were lower in toxicity and genotoxicity than the free compounds and after 7 days
    of treatment, caused changes in the soil bacteria population (Maruyama et al.,
    2016a). Soils treated with just the CS/ALG and CS/TPP nanoparticles had an increase
    of bacteria compared with the negative control, while the encapsulated herbicides
    caused a decrease in the bacterial population (Maruyama et al., 2016a). The effects
    of these engineered nanoparticles on the soil microbiota profile were based on
    the analysis of specific bacterial genes related to the nitrogen cycle, with free
    herbicide application resulting in a vastly different nitrogen cycle microbiota
    profile. The herbicide-encapsulated CS/ALG and CS/TPP nanoparticles produced a
    less abrasive effect on the soil microbiota as the bacterial profile was similar
    to that of the negative control, indicating that encapsulation can reduce the
    harmful effects of herbicides on the soil (Maruyama et al., 2016a). Another cost-effective
    and renewable natural material for creating engineered nanoparticles is starch.
    The various methods to produce starch nanoparticles include hydrolysis chemical,
    enzymatic, and physical (e.g. extrusion, irradiation, ultrasound and ultra-sonication)
    treatments (Ahmad et al., 2020). Long duration time, low yield and production
    of environmental toxic waste are several disadvantages to the large-scale manufacturing
    of starch nanoparticles, although research is attempting to develop more efficient
    and sustainable techniques (Ahmad et al., 2020; Parsi et al., 2014). Starch material
    can be readily sourced from a range of plant materials, including waste sources,
    making them an attractive and abundant resource in polymeric nanoparticle production.
    These nanoparticles have promising applications as delivery vehicles, e.g. where
    banana starch nanoparticles have been designed to deliver the antioxidant β-carotene
    to the gastrointestinal tract (Santoyo-Aleman et al., 2019). A similar technique
    was used to encapsulate the antioxidant lutein, to maintain its stability and
    bioactivity, as well as to promote its dispersity in water (Fu et al., 2019).
    Starch materials have also been used to encapsulate herbicides and pesticides
    (Doane, 1992; Glenn et al., 2010). In one study, honey bee digestible porous starch
    microspheres, 45 μm in diameter, were used to encapsulate essential plant oils
    (thymol, clove, origanum, and camphor) to control the Varroa mite pest efficiently
    in honey bee colonies (Glenn et al., 2010). While several of these examples generate
    starch particles that are microns in size, they signify the possible application
    of starch nanoparticles. In the biomedical field, sodium tripolyphosphate cross-linked
    starch nanoparticles (20–70 nm in diameter) were loaded with varying concentrations
    of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac sodium (DS). This study
    showed that certain formulations of the starch nanoparticle and drugs results
    in a sustained drug release non-irritant transdermal delivery system (El-Naggar
    et al., 2015). As well as delivering antioxidants, nutrients, biostimulants, and
    crop protection molecules, nanoparticles could be used to deliver genetic (DNA,
    RNA) material. Starch nanoparticles synthesized in water-in-oil microemulsion
    at room temperature, and coated with poly-L-lysine, were successfully used as
    plant transgenic vehicles to deliver pEGAD plasmid DNA. Ultrasound-mediated delivery
    of starch polymeric nanoparticles overcame the difficulties of transferring genetic
    material through the protective and rigid plant cell wall (Liu et al., 2008).
    Polymers offer a range of materials to create nanocarriers with varying physiochemical
    and transport properties, which can facilitate efficiency and lower environmental
    impacts by allowing for the adjustable release of herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers,
    genes and antibiotics (Table 2) (Shakiba et al., 2020). However, production techniques
    and material choice do pose some environmental and health concerns. Many of these
    polymeric nanoparticles exhibit low biological toxicity in humans, although several
    types of polymeric materials have been noted to cause biological toxicity in in
    vivo and in vitro conditions. For example, PLGA is associated with macrophage
    uptake, phototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (Yuan et al., 2017b). Consideration must
    additionally be given to the manufacturing, storage and disposal processes of
    engineered nanoparticles, as secondary toxic substances can be produced from the
    use of chemical solvents and catalysts during synthesis (Gupta and Xie, 2018).
    The environmental toxicity of polymeric engineered nanoparticles also raises concerns,
    as chitosan has shown relatively high toxicity with a predicted no-effect concentration
    of 5 μg/L in freshwater, an ecotoxicity comparable to that of many other pharmaceuticals,
    heavy metals and organic pollutants (Hauser et al., 2019). However, there appear
    to be some polymeric nanoparticles that have chemical compositions with nontoxic,
    biodegradable and environmentally friendly profiles. These include starch, polylactic
    (PLA) and poly β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) materials (Han et al., 2018). Despite these
    properties, the toxicity of engineered polymeric nanoparticles is dependent on
    dosage, and the physicochemical properties (i.e. size, charge density, shape,
    molecular mass, composition, and chemical properties) (Sukhanova et al., 2018).
    As there are many possibilities when designing polymeric nanoparticles, a thorough
    examination of the toxicity and safety issues should be made for each type prior
    to use. Prior to large-scale application, the local biological effects of polymeric
    nanoparticle application on the soil microbiome, biodiversity, the workforce applying
    the tools, and on the food chain, need to be evaluated. In addition, it is crucial
    to have a better understanding of the immediate and long-term environmental hazards
    these nanoparticles will have on the open environment. Thus, comprehensive ecological
    and environmental risk assessments and experiments are necessary to identify polymeric
    materials suitable for large-scale agriculture purposes. 3.3. Biological (bacterial,
    milk and plants) The concerns regarding the toxicity and adverse reaction associated
    with metal and synthetic nanoparticles have led to the exploration of alternative
    delivery vehicles. Biologically derived nanoparticles (Fig. 1C) for delivering
    drugs, proteins, nucleic acids and other substances to tissues can be artificially
    created (e.g. liposomes), or derived from organisms (e.g. plants, milk and bacteria
    nanovesicles) (Table 3). Table 3. Biologically derived nanoparticles and applications

    number: NCT01294072, 2011(Wong et al., 2019) Liposomes are small, artificial,
    spherical-shaped vesicles with one or more phospholipid bilayers (Akbarzadeh et
    al., 2013). The advantages of liposome nanoparticles is that they are non-toxic,
    biocompatible, biodegradable and non-immunogenic carriers of numerous drugs and
    compounds. Additionally, the surface of liposomes can be modified to include site-specific
    ligands and/or the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to improve
    pharmacokinetic properties and biodistribution. In the biomedical and agricultural
    spaces to support health, growth and yield, unstable compounds such as antimicrobials
    and antioxidants have been encapsulated in liposomes to prevent compound degradation
    and off-targeting effects (Hallaj-Nezhadi and Hassan, 2015; Karny et al., 2018;
    Shukla et al., 2017). There are also examples of liposome nanoparticles created
    for delivering antimicrobial agents, utilized as biosensors and for environmental
    remediation (refer to the review by Hallaj-Nezhadi and Hassan (2015)). Yet there
    are challenges when using liposomes as delivery vehicles owing to low solubility,
    short half-lives, oxidation and hydrolysis-like reactions of the phospholipids,
    leakage or fusion of the encapsulated compounds, and high production costs (Akbarzadeh
    et al., 2013). To address a few of these disadvantages, research has assessed
    the insertion of asymmetrical nanobowl nanostructures to stabilize liposomes,
    to maintain surface integrity and prevent leakage (Chen et al., 2020). Nanovesicles
    such as extracellular vesicles and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are cell-derived,
    membrane-bound vesicles ranging from ∼30 to 1000 nm in diameter (Anand and Chaudhuri,
    2016; Gyorgy et al., 2011; Thery et al., 2002). These nanovesicles are released
    by eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, and through the transport of bioactive (DNA,
    RNA, lipid and protein) cargo, are involved in intercellular and cross-species
    communication. Biologically sourced vesicles are capable of entering host cells
    mainly through endocytic pathways such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and lipid
    raft-mediated pathways (Canas et al., 2016). As these nanoparticles are internalized
    by cells and act as delivery vehicles, methods are being developed by numerous
    groups to engineer and design biologically sourced nanovesicles for health applications
    (Gnopo et al., 2017a; Tan et al., 2018). Presently, there are three main biological
    sources of great interest that are known to be enriched with natural derived nanoparticles:
    bacteria, milk and plants. In bacteria, these nanovesicles are known as OMVs and
    are involved in virulence and modulation of host immunity (Gnopo et al., 2017a;
    Tan et al., 2018). Bacterial OMVs have the ability to stimulate the innate, cell-mediated
    and adaptive immune systems (Tan et al., 2018). Additionally, bacterial OMVs induce
    a second type of immune response known as effector-triggered immunity, which is
    mediated by intracellular receptors recognizing intercellular secreted pathogen
    effectors (Bahar et al., 2016; Dodds and Rathjen, 2010). Due to their low toxicity
    and availability, bacterial OMVs are considered as promising vaccine adjuvants
    (Tan et al., 2018). One method involves using OMVs as pathogen mimetic adjuvants
    to activate the innate immune system, as these bacterially derived nanovesicles
    express unique pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with immunomodulatory
    properties (Kaparakis-Liaskos and Ferrero, 2015). OMV-based vaccines are created
    by isolating OMVs from target pathogens or engineered in the bacterial host to
    express homologous or heterologous antigens for different pathogens (Gnopo et
    al., 2017a, 2017b; Irene et al., 2019). This strategy has been used to create
    OMVs with low toxicity and the ability to induce antibody-mediated immunity using
    engineered bacteria (e.g. E. coli, Neisseria meningitidis and S. aureus) as a
    factory (Fantappiè et al., 2014; Zariri et al., 2016). Vesicle-based vaccines
    are not a new concept, as meningococcal vaccines were developed over 25 years
    ago using wild-type OMVs from Neisseria meningitidis (Holst et al., 2009, 2013).
    This approach was transferred to aquaculture, where flounder stocks were immunized
    against the infectious and deadly marine and freshwater fish pathogen E. tarda
    (Park et al., 2011). E. tarda is a global issue in the aquaculture industry and
    with its infectious properties, this pathogen can be transmitted to humans, where
    it causes gastroenteritis and diarrhea (Anand and Chaudhuri, 2016). Isolated OMVs
    from E. tarda were used to induce an immune response and aid fish species in the
    development of protection against infection (Castro et al., 2008; Park et al.,
    2011). The use of OMV vaccines in fish has also been applied against the intracellular
    bacteria Francisella noatunensis to reduce the pathogen population without adverse
    effects to the host, thereby protecting the animal (Brudal et al., 2015). In plants,
    there is a rich diversity of plant pathogenic bacteria, though evidence of OMV
    fusion with plant cells is lacking (Katsir and Bahar, 2017). Upon infection, OMVs
    released in plants have a role in biofilm formation, virulence, and activation
    of the plant immune response (Katsir and Bahar, 2017). By priming and enhancing
    the plant’s immune response, OMV vaccines may be a nontoxic and effective method
    to protect plants from diseases and pathogens. Although these vesicles have immunogenic
    properties that make them attractive vaccine adjuvants, to reduce toxicity and
    optimize efficacy when generating OMV-based vaccines, the removal of endotoxic
    molecules that cause severe effects in the host (lipopolysaccharides) and other
    modifications are required to ensure safety (Price et al., 2016; Raetz and Whitfield,
    2002). Milk is another enriched biological source for extracellular vesicles that
    can have bioactive effects upon ingestion (Golan-Gerstl et al., 2017; Liao et
    al., 2017). Extracellular vesicles derived from commercial milk and breast milk
    have been reported by independent groups to survive simulated human digestion
    and be taken up by intestinal epithelial cells, where they promoted cell proliferation
    and differentiation (Hock et al., 2017; Kahn et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2017;
    Rani et al., 2017). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding regulatory small
    RNAs (15–30 nucleotides) that regulate the expression of key genes involved in
    many important biological and metabolic pathways (Ambros, 2004). It appears that
    extracellular vesicles in milk can enhance the delivery of miRNAs by protecting
    them during the digestive process (Benmoussa et al., 2016; Kahn et al., 2018;
    Liao et al., 2017). Synthetic miRNAs do not survive long in milk and are degraded
    within 10 min, whereas miRNAs packaged in vesicles are protected from RNAase A
    digestion and degradation from low pH, and freeze-thaw cycles (Benmoussa et al.,
    2016, 2017; Pieters et al., 2015). Small RNA sequencing and computational target
    identification of miRNAs packaged into bovine milk extracellular vesicles show
    that of the ∼109–1010 copies of a single miRNA per 300 mL of milk, many are associated
    with immunity (Benmoussa et al., 2016, 2017; Lindsay, 2008; Pieters et al., 2015;
    Zempleni et al., 2017). The immune-associated miRNA profile of extracellular vesicles
    from commercial milk contains miRNAs such as miR-124a, which targets the cytokine
    involved in monocyte/macrophage infiltration through the monocyte chemoattractant
    protein 1 (MCP-1) signaling pathway (Deshmane et al., 2009). Several miRNAs (mir-21,
    mir-let7, mir-146a, mir-146b, mir-126, mir-155, mir-199a) with targets in the
    TLR/IL-1 inflammatory pathway are also detected in milk extracellular vesicles
    (Arntz et al., 2015; Benmoussa et al., 2017). Immune-associated miRNAs have likewise
    been found to be abundant in breast milk extracellular vesicles, suggesting that
    milk miRNAs may have positive effects on childhood immune system development (Admyre
    et al., 2008; Alsaweed et al., 2015; Zempleni et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2012).
    Arntz et al. (2015) studied the in vitro and in vivo uptake of bovine-milk derived
    extracellular vesicles and immune regulatory miRNAs, as well as the effect of
    oral delivery in two murine experimental arthritis models. Milk vesicles were
    taken up in vitro by splenocytes and intestinal cells, while in vivo, orally administrated
    fluorescently labeled vesicles were detected in macrophages (after 1–3 h) and
    ileum tissue (after 24 h) (Arntz et al., 2015). The daily administration of milk
    extracellular vesicles for nine weeks in two experimental arthritis models was
    found to delay the onset of the disease (Arntz et al., 2015). Milk-derived vesicles
    have additionally been reported to be taken up by cancer cells, kidney cells and
    human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Baier et al., 2014; Wolf et al., 2015),
    highlighting the application of these nanovesicles for the therapeutic delivery
    of drugs and RNA interference (RNAi) molecules for a range of diseases in humans
    and perhaps livestock (Arntz et al., 2015; Matsuda and Patel, 2018). An alternative
    food-derived source of nanovesicles with low immunogenicity are plant materials,
    particularly from fruit and vegetable sources. Plant-derived vesicles appear to
    have unique transport properties and are capable of cross-species communication
    (Ju et al., 2013; Mu et al., 2014). Similar to milk extracellular vesicles, plant-derived
    vesicles are able to survive harsh and acidic gastrointestinal digestive conditions
    (Mu et al., 2014). Nanovesicles isolated from grapefruit, grape, ginger and carrots
    have all been reported to be taken up by mammalian intestinal stem cells and macrophages,
    where they have been found to stimulate cell proliferation and protect against
    inflammation by inducing expression of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory genes
    (Ju et al., 2013; Mu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, edible-derived
    plant nanovesicles from lemon were observed to inhibit tumor growth in several
    cancer cell types (Raimondo et al., 2015). While ginger-derived nanovesicles seem
    not only to promote intestinal proliferation but are also able to target bacterial
    pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis) that cause inflammatory diseases (Sundaram
    et al., 2019) and modulate the gut microbiota to improve barrier function and
    alleviate colitis (Teng et al., 2018). Extracellular vesicles are released by
    plants as part of an innate immune response in the defense against pathogens.
    In a groundbreaking study, Cai et al. (2018) demonstrated that in response to
    Botrytis cinerea infection, the Arabidopsis plant secretes extracellular vesicles
    that will gather at infection sites to be then incorporated into the fungal pathogen
    (Cai et al., 2018). Plants use these extracellular vesicles to transfer small
    RNAs that can induce silencing of pathogen genes responsible for pathogenicity.
    Given plant-derived nanovesicles are a principal component in the natural immune
    defense against pathogens (i.e. fungi, bacteria) (Sundaram et al., 2019; Teng
    et al., 2018), and that there is evidence of selective uptake by mammalian tissue
    (Ju et al., 2013; Mu et al., 2014; Raimondo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017),
    these nanovesicles may have applications in pre- and post-harvest plant protection,
    as well as in protecting agriculture and aquaculture stocks. The small RNA cargo
    transported by plant-derived nanovesicles has been demonstrated to be a major
    bioactive in modulating the response of the target species (Cai et al., 2018;
    Teng et al., 2018). An analysis of the miRNA profile of edible plant-derived nanoparticles
    from 11 fruits and vegetables revealed that of the 418 identified miRNAs, many
    are predicted to regulate targets that are associated with the inflammatory response
    and cancer pathways (Xiao et al., 2018). Cross-species RNAi gene silencing is
    an environmentally friendly and non-toxic alternative to chemical fungicides and
    pesticides to protect plants against parasites, insects, fungi, bacteria and plant
    viruses (Huang et al., 2006; Koch et al., 2016; Pridgeon et al., 2008; Wang et
    al., 2017). As such, RNAi sprays composed of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or
    small RNAs are used on plants to induce gene silencing in diseases. However, such
    RNAi sprays are not long lasting, losing efficacy in 10 days as the RNA degrades
    (Koch et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016, 2017). Biodegradable clay nanoparticles
    have proven to be effective for RNA delivery, protecting dsRNAs from degradation
    and from being washed away from the plant surface (Mitter et al., 2017). Biologically
    sourced nanovesicles would provide another nanotechnology option in the agrifoods
    sector to enhance the delivery of beneficial bioactives, as several plant-derived
    nanovesicles have shown promise in the medical therapy field as a delivery vectors
    for drugs, small RNAs, molecular agents and proteins (Akuma et al., 2019; Iravani
    and Varma, 2019; Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016, 2017).
    A small size, low toxicity, non-replicative behavior, as well as biocompatible
    and transporting properties of bacterial and food-derived nanovesicles make them
    attractive vehicles for drug delivery. Nanovesicles are readily isolated from
    cultured bacteria, milk and plant material (Akuma et al., 2019; Anand and Chaudhuri,
    2016; Griffin et al., 2017; Iravani and Varma, 2019; Munagala et al., 2016), and
    thus these biodegradable materials provide scalable and sustainable sources for
    the development of drug delivery medicines to boost health and prevent diseases
    caused by pathogens in the agricultural sectors. Various techniques are being
    investigated to load naturally derived vesicles with bioactive and drug-based
    cargoes (Akuma et al., 2019; García-Manrique et al., 2018; Luan et al., 2017;
    Qing et al., 2019; Raimondo et al., 2019). Passive loading techniques involve
    an incubation process and are based on diffusion and hydrophobic interactions
    between the vesicle and the compound (Akuma et al., 2019; García-Manrique et al.,
    2018; Luan et al., 2017). The plant polyphenol curcumin, known for vast therapeutic
    potential (antifungal, antiviral and antioxidant) and in disease prevention (Rahmani
    et al., 2018), has been successfully encapsulated in milk vesicles with this method
    (Vashisht et al., 2017). Clinical trials using plant nanovesicles to improve the
    delivery of curcumin to colon cancer cells are currently underway (Wong et al.,
    2019) (NCT number: NCT01294072, 2011). However, as this technique is dependent
    on the compound and vesicle, a low yield of the compound may be encapsulated in
    the vesicle. An alternative active loading method for proteins, drugs and small
    RNAs is through the use of techniques that include electroporation, sonication,
    freeze thaw cycles, pressurization and extrusion over membrane filters and microchannels
    (Akuma et al., 2019; García-Manrique et al., 2018; Raimondo et al., 2019). Delivery
    can be an issue for nanoparticles, although there appears to be uptake of biologically
    sourced nanovesicles by specific cell types. Furthermore, the membrane surface
    of biological nanovesicles can be adapted and optimized to improve tissue targeting
    and decrease off-target effects (Raimondo et al., 2019). There are several cases
    where plant-derived nanovesicles from ginger and grapefruit have been modified
    to enhance the delivery of specific miRNAs to targeted tissues to ameliorate diseases
    (Wang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017). In one study, grapefruit nanovesicles
    were successfully coated at the surface with folic acid to enhance targeting to
    a folate receptor-positive brain tumor, and engineered to deliver a therapeutic
    miRNA (Zhuang et al., 2016). The surface antigen and proteins on OMVs can also
    be modified to enable targeting to specific bacteria or to elicit a specific immune
    response. Despite the promise of bacterial OMVs and food-derived nanovesicles
    as delivery vehicles and sensors in the biomedical and agricultural sector, this
    is still an emerging field. There is much to uncover about the bio-accessibility,
    targeting, safety and efficacy of designed vesicles, as well as sustainable mass
    isolation of nanovesicles at the industrial level. A major challenge is the large-scale
    purified isolation of these biologically sourced vesicles. Ultracentrifugation
    is commonly used to purify nanovesicles, though this system is time consuming,
    requires consistent electrical power, contaminants may be co-purified, there is
    heterogeneity in the nanovesicles population, and the high forces can cause aggregation
    and rupture (Burnouf et al., 2019; Paganini et al., 2019). Research is now focusing
    on developing scalable, cost-effective and high-throughput processing techniques
    to isolate such types of nanovesicles. Techniques such as tangential flow filtration
    (TFF), size exclusion chromatography, affinity interactions and the promising
    microfluidic system are attractive platforms to address the challenges of large-scale
    purification (Paganini et al., 2019). Presently, very few examples exist regarding
    the use of biologically sourced nanovesicles to provide nutrients, prevent disease
    and in the defense against pathogens in the agricultural sector. However, there
    is the potential these nanovesicles could additionally be used for quality control,
    acting as sensors to provide insights into food quality, the health status of
    the organism or to monitor infection rates (Huang, 2017). The use of biologically
    derived nanoparticles as agricultural tools would have implications for the agriculture
    industry, but will require further in-depth research to reveal the capability
    and safety of these environmentally friendly vesicles for use in the complex agricultural
    ecosystem. 4. Summary Nanoparticles present a number of opportunities to improve
    growth, breeding, disease and pest control, and postharvest quality in the food
    production areas of agriculture, aquaculture, food processing, and food safety.
    The range of nanoparticle materials on offer, as well as their unique structural,
    solubility and compositional characteristics, provides many advantages for the
    design of versatile tools with diverse applications that could prove “game changers”
    for sustainable and precision agriculture. Biologically sourced nanoparticles
    that contain beneficial bioactives could be used to deliver nutrients that enhance
    the growth and health of food sources. Selectively packaged nanoparticles with
    targeted time-controlled release capabilities is one avenue to improve food production
    and safety by reducing the amount of harmful off-target chemical compounds used
    against pathogens. Designed coated, tagged and targeted nanoparticles could also
    be used as nanosensors to detect chemicals or foodborne pathogens. Furthermore,
    nanoparticles may have beneficial uses in contaminant detection and remediation.
    Yet there are concerns because of the lack of information regarding their biodegradability,
    accumulation in the environment, and recyclability (Alimi et al., 2018; Bundschuh
    et al., 2018; Chen, 2018), as well as possible health and ecological effects of
    these nanoparticles following application. It is important before introducing
    this technology into the food production and supply system that there is thorough
    experimental validation, the regulatory requirements are met, environmental and
    physiological risk assessment and mitigation plans are made, as well as engagement
    with end-users, who will include the farmers and consumers. CRediT authorship

  description: Over the past few decades, advanced polymeric materials have gained
    popularity in the development of sustainable agricultural applications. Smart
    polymeric systems have extensively contributed to the agricultural industry by
    increasing the efficiency of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers by facilitating
    controlled release systems and, therefore, enabling lower doses to be used. Superabsorbent
    polymeric materials have been used as soil conditioners to control the impact
    of drought, whereas polycationic polymers have been utilized for plant bioengineering.
    These functions in the environment are complemented by applications within plants
    as part of the developing range of tools for genetically transforming plants in
    order to increase productivity and disease resistance. This Review will summarize
    and discuss the recent developments in the design and application of advanced
    polymeric systems for precision agriculture related applications. The design criteria
    of the polymers employed to date, such as polymer structure, as well as the properties
    of polymer nanoparticles including shape and size will be discussed, and the key
    findings in the related area will be highlighted. Finally, we will identify future
    directions for the exploration of functional polymers with the ultimate aim of
    advancing sustainable agriculture.

    been utilized for plant bioengineering. These functions in the environment are
    complemented by applications within plants as part of the developing range of
    tools for genetically transforming plants in order to increase productivity and

    plant bioengineering sustainable agriculture 1. Introduction ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To Agriculture represents one of the most important contributors to good health,
    environmental pollution, sufficient nutrition, and economic development. (1) Initially,
    the driving force for agricultural development worldwide was to increase the productivity
    per unit area of land used for crop production, and over the years, this has been
    achieved through extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides and the exploitation
    of natural resources such as soil and water. (2) In response to the accumulating
    environmental impacts, recently, the world has begun striving toward more sustainable
    agricultural practices (3) for a better tomorrow. Some of the current issues now
    facing global agriculture are the needs to control the delivery of agrochemicals
    and to cope with soil degradation, water pollution, climate change, and ever-evolving
    plant pathogens and disease. (4−7) As scientific capabilities increase, new polymeric
    materials are proving to be potent and promising candidates for effectively addressing
    these issues. Polymers (8−10) are a class of versatile materials that have been
    used extensively in agriculture, as their properties such as structure, functionality,
    and biodegradability can be tailored to specific applications. More recently,
    research has started exploring bespoke and stimuli-responsive smart polymeric
    systems (11) for various plant applications. The continued development in technology
    and the use of advanced functional polymeric materials have together contributed
    to improvements in the controlled delivery of agrochemicals, soil conditioners,
    nutrients, water management, genetic engineering, and more. (12−16) To the best
    of our knowledge, no comprehensive reviews have been published thus far covering
    the breadth of research “hotspots” in advanced polymers for agriculture. In this
    regard, we have compiled a detailed Review focusing on the impacts that synthetic
    polymers have made in farming with a discussion on the structure and design aspects
    of these materials and key literature findings in a comprehensive manner. We will
    first introduce the general concept of functional polymer materials, their structure
    and uses, and then focus on several prominent research directions for these materials
    which include (i) controlled delivery of agrochemicals; (ii) water utilization
    by superabsorbent polymers; (iii) other applications inside plants and organisms.
    Furthermore, we will consider the most significant challenges that need to be
    overcome in order to increase the efficiency and commercialization of these polymeric
    materials. Finally, we will indicate potential new opportunities and applications
    of novel functional polymers that can contribute to the development of sustainable
    agricultural practices. 2. Functional Polymers ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To A functional
    polymer (17−19) is any polymer that contains additional functional groups that
    differ in their chemistry to the backbone chain (Scheme 1a). These polymers often
    possess unique properties that can be tuned by altering these groups along the
    backbone. Furthermore, “smart” polymers contain functional groups that are responsive
    to stimuli, such as pH, light, or temperature, (20−22) which can further alter
    the polymer properties. There are many naturally occurring functional polymers
    (Scheme 1a) such as agar, (23) starches, (24) alginates, (25) chitosan, (26) and
    cellulose. (27) Synthetic functional polymers were first developed in the 1960s
    by Szwarc, Bywater, and Morton. (28) Since then, these materials have occupied
    an eminent place in modern science with rapidly growing interest due to the potential
    applications of these materials in biomedical science, (29,30) materials science,
    (31) and energy and the environment. (32,33) One niche area of research has focused
    on developing functional polymers for sustainable agriculture. (34) Scheme 1 Scheme
    1. Different Aspects of Advanced Polymers Used in Agriculture Related Applicationsa
    a(a) Natural functional groups and (b) synthetic functional polymers discussed
    in this Review. (c) Different polymer architectures possible through various synthetic
    techniques. The two major criteria for polymeric materials to be commercially
    viable in field-based agricultural applications are cheap and readily available
    raw materials and polymer biodegradability. Natural polymers meet these criteria;
    however, they have two major drawbacks: (i) the properties of natural polymers
    in their native state often do not fit the needs of specific applications and
    (ii) modification of these polymers is often difficult due to their lack of suitable
    functional groups as well as insolubility in organic solvents for common organic
    reactions. (35,36) These drawbacks can eventually cause an undesirable excess
    use of natural polymers to improve agricultural production. This has led to research
    into synthetic polymers as an alternative strategy. In recent years, controlled
    radical polymerization techniques such as atom-transfer radical polymerization,
    (37) nitroxide-mediated polymerization, (38) and reversible addition–fragmentation
    chain-transfer polymerization (39) have enabled the facile synthesis of polymers
    with a wide range of functional groups (Scheme 1b). In addition to the control
    over polymer functional groups, various synthetic techniques can also give access
    to a wide range of polymer architectures (Scheme 1c) such as block copolymers,
    (40) dendrimers, (41) bottle-brush polymers, (42) and hyperbranched polymers,
    (43) further expanding the range of materials that can be used in agriculture.
    However, the common drawbacks to synthetic polymers−high costs of production and
    lack of biodegradability−will likely limit their immediate implementation until
    they can be addressed. For example, biodegradability can be introduced by incorporating
    biodegradable polymers (44) such as poly(caprolactone), poly(lactide), poly(glycolic
    acid), or poly(vinyl alcohol) into the polymer backbone. Synthetic–natural hybrid
    polymers (45−47) have also emerged as potential materials, as they are based on
    cheap, natural polymers but also have properties of synthetic functional polymers.
    Through the concerted efforts of polymer chemists, synthetic polymers have been
    successfully used across a broad range of applications in agriculture, contributing
    powerful new tools for the agricultural and food industries, which will be discussed
    in the following sections. 3. Controlled Agrochemical Delivery ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To Agrochemicals such as fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides are essential
    in agriculture; however, they are also associated with undesirable environmental
    impacts, including bioaccumulation in the food chain and contamination of ecosystems.
    Controlled release techniques that combine agrochemicals with functional polymers
    have emerged as a strategy to deliver the required agrochemical at its active
    field rate over a long time period without unwanted leaching into the environment.
    This strategy may also reduce degradation, evaporation, and wash-away of the active
    agents into the soil, improving efficiency while reducing environment toxicity
    and thereby enhancing practical applicability and human health. The desirable
    properties of suitable delivery systems for sustainable agriculture should (i)
    control release of the agrochemicals at the lowest effective concentration, (ii)
    protect the agrochemical from degrading environments such as light and pH, (iii)
    possess lower cytotoxicity than the conventional pesticides, and (iv) have long
    lasting validity of the nanocarriers, which will reduce the frequency of pesticide
    application and treatment by extending the lasting validity period. Some examples
    of functional polymers that have been used for agrochemical delivery are summarized
    in Table 1. Table 1. Examples of Different Polymers Used for Controlled Agrochemical

    Encapsulation and Noncovalent Loading of Polymer Assemblies One of the most versatile
    methods for preparing nanocarriers is the physical encapsulation of an active
    agent within amphiphilic polymers as they form self-assembled nanoparticles in
    aqueous media. One such nanocarrier system was reported by Tong et al., (48) who
    demonstrated the self-assembly of a block copolymer of biocompatible poly(ethylene
    glycol) (PEG) and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). These blocks
    were selected to generate amphiphilicity-driven nanoparticles in water with the
    hydrophobic core providing a loading space for the herbicide metolachlor, while
    the hydrophilic shell could shield the herbicide and improve its solubility in
    water (Figure 1a). These nanoparticles were shown to have a lower toxicity to
    nontarget human cells compared to the free herbicide. They also showed that the
    particle size could be tuned by changing the loading amount of metolachlor and
    found that the copolymer/metolachlor ratio of 4:1 was ideal for producing nanoparticles
    small enough for rapid uptake into root cells. A higher herbicidal activity was
    observed in rice and hairy crabgrass when using the metolachlor-loaded nanoparticles
    compared to the free herbicide. Figure 1 Figure 1. Representation of active ingredient-loaded
    nanoparticles. (a) Schematic representation of the preparation of metolachlor-loaded

    et al. (49) have reported a series of amphiphilic copolymer micelles synthesized
    from PEG-b-poly(aliphatic acid) for the controlled delivery of imidacloprid. PEG
    300, 600, and 1000 were selected as the hydrophilic moieties, whereas various
    aliphatic diacids, namely, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, and suberic
    acid, were used as the hydrophobic headgroup. The effect of PEG chain length and
    the nature of the hydrophobic headgroup on the critical aggregation constant,
    size of micelles, imidacloprid encapsulation efficiency, and release rate were
    investigated. The release rate of imidacloprid from these micelles (size ∼ 170–250
    nm) was found to be slower than from the commercially available formulations;
    however, no uniform trend could be observed for the polymers having different
    hydrophilic–hydrophobic segments. The same pesticide was also encapsulated into
    5–10 μm sized particles composed of an amphiphilic diblock polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic
    acid). (50) It was demonstrated that the concentration of imidacloprid required
    when using such functional microdispensers was 200 times lower than for commercial
    formulations against crop pests. Along with amphiphilic diblock polymers, triblock
    copolymers have also been utilized to prepare agrochemical delivery systems. Memarizadeh
    et al. (51) synthesized ABA triblock linear dendritic copolymers composed of poly(citric
    acid) (PCA) as the dendritic A block and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the linear
    B block. This triblock polymer self-assembled to form nanoparticles in water,
    and imidacloprid was loaded through hydrophobic interactions. Experimental results
    revealed that imidacloprid nanoencapsulation was associated with increased mortality
    of Glyphodes pyloalis larvae and a reduced LC50 (50% lethal concentration) compared
    to the free imidacloprid. The rate of release of agrochemicals is highly dependent
    on the nature of the polymer, i.e., hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio, linear/branched
    nature, degree of cross-linking, and various noncovalent interactions (H-bonding,
    ionic interaction etc.) and can be effectively tuned by modifying any of these
    parameters. Rychter et al. (52) examined the influence of a relatively small PEG
    block content in poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide)–poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide)
    (PLGA–PEG–PLGA) with respect to polymer degradation and herbicide release. They
    found that the presence of even a short PEG block in the terpolymer chain increased
    the overall hydrophilicity of the polymer, thereby increasing its susceptibility
    to hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation in the soil environment. The introduction
    of the PEG block within PLGA–PEG–PLGA terpolymers also decreased the degree of
    crystallinity, which facilitated rapid biodegradation. The authors further prepared
    a series of herbicide-loaded polymers by varying the ratio of PEG to demonstrate
    tunable release properties. In an interesting report by Dabbaghi and Rahmani,
    (53) a series of multicomponent amphiphilic cross-linked networks were synthesized
    (Figure 1b) from various combinations of azide- and alkyne-functionalized precursors
    (azido-terminated star-shaped poly(caprolactone), azido-terminated PEG, alkyne-terminated
    PEG) by a combination of ring-opening polymerization and click chemistry. The
    swelling behavior, biodegradability, and encapsulated 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
    acid (2,4-D) herbicide release was tuned by changing the ratio of hydrophobic
    segments and hydrophilic segments as well as by varying the cross-linking density.
    A higher cross-linking density and increased hydrophilicity resulted in less swelling
    and a slower degradation rate, giving a desirable release profile of the encapsulated
    agrochemical. The nature of the cross-linker can also have a significant effect
    on agrochemical release properties. One study demonstrated this by preparing poly(acrylamide-co-itaconic
    acid) hydrogels cross-linked with either ethylene glycol-dimethacrylate (EGDMA)
    or N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (NMBA). (54) The authors then evaluated the controlled
    release of a potassium nitrate fertilizer and demonstrated that the cross-linker
    provided distinct active sites to interact with the nitrate ions and pore sizes
    that allowed both its retention and also continuous and controlled release. A
    change in the cross-linker resulted in a different hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance,
    which affected the hydrogels swelling and release rates. A higher swelling percentage
    as well as faster release rate were observed for the more hydrophilic EGDMA cross-linked
    hydrogel in water compared to the NMBA cross-linked gels. The authors observed
    that swelling kinetics were affected in saline solution for the EGDMA cross-linked
    polymer due to ionic interactions with the EGDMA moiety, whereas a negligible
    effect was observed on the NMBA cross-linked polymer. Liu et al. (55) introduced
    fluorescently-labelled nanocarriers for agrochemical delivery and release that
    could enable facile tracing in the food chain through the simple detection mode
    of fluorescence. They developed a unique type of pesticide nanocarrier using a
    water-soluble cationic dendrimer, which consisted of a fluorescent perylene diimide
    (PDI) core connected to dendritic hydrophobic polyesters and peripheral amino
    groups (Figure 1c). A hydrophobic insecticide, thiamethoxam, was loaded and immobilized
    via synergistic electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The dendrimer-based
    nanocarriers could efficiently deliver the drug into live cells, increasing the
    cytotoxicity of the drug and the larval mortality. Grillo et al. (56) demonstrated
    that the surface properties of a polymeric carrier can also affect its release.
    They prepared two different biodegradable microparticles using the emulsion/solvent
    evaporation technique for the sustainable release of the herbicide triazine. Poly(hydroxybutyrate)
    (PHB) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-valerate) (PHBV) were used as the hydrophobic core
    materials for loading the herbicide, while hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol) was
    used as an emulsifier to increase their solubility in aqueous medium. SEM analysis
    revealed that both microparticle formulations were spherical but had different
    surface porosities (a smooth surface for PHB microparticles whereas a rough surface
    with pores for PHBV microparticles), and the herbicide release profiles differed
    according to the different surface properties. The release efficiencies were calculated
    to be ∼74% and ∼85% for the PHB and PHBV microparticles, respectively. The authors
    explained that the interaction of the PHB moiety with valerate in PHBV caused
    polymer plastification by reducing the free volume and crystallinity, resulting
    in a faster release compared to PHB microparticles. In addition, the morphology
    of the nanocarriers has been shown to have a major impact on their controlled
    release properties. Pereira et al. (57) studied the effects of two different types
    of poly(ε-caprolactone) particles, nanocapsules and nanospheres, for the delivery
    of the herbicide atrazine in target and nontarget plant species. Nanospheres were
    produced by an oil-in-water method using the polymer alone, whereas the nanocapsules
    were prepared using the same method but further adding the surfactant capric triglyceride
    along with the polymer. The nanocapsules were found to have a lower physiological
    stability compared to nanospheres, with the nanospheres remaining stable throughout
    a 90-day period, whereas the size of the nanocapsules increased with time, indicating
    aggregation. The authors provided a possible hypothesis that the instability of
    the nanocapsules was due to oxidation of the oil used in the preparation method,
    which then further interacts with the surfactants in the medium, eventually increasing
    interparticle interactions and resulting in aggregation. However, both types of
    nanoparticles were loaded with atrazine at over 90% encapsulation efficiency and
    showed prolonged release into water while being less genotoxic than free atrazine.
    Liu et al. (58) prepared three types of delivery systems using poly(lactic acid):
    microcapsules, microspheres, and porous microcapsules for delivery of the insecticide
    λ-cyhalothrin. The release of the pesticide was found to be controlled mainly
    by diffusion and matrix degradation. By manipulating the process parameters, they
    were able to construct nanocarrier systems with tunable sizes as well as different
    loading contents. They noted that the weight ratios of poly(lactic acid)/λ-cyhalothrin
    and the size of the microcapsules affected the release of the pesticide, with
    smaller microcapsules having faster release rates. Similarly, pellet and microgranule
    shaped nanocarriers were prepared using a poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate
    copolymer to evaluate the impact of the carrier shape for sustainable herbicide
    release. (59) Depending on shape as well as polymer/pesticide mass ratio, these
    nanoparticles showed different kinetic profiles of polymer degradation (whereby
    the polymer pellet showed a faster degradation profile than the granules) with
    an overall controlled release of the pesticide in soils, and demonstrated excellent
    killing efficiency against creeping bentgrass. 3.1.2. Covalent Polymer–Agrochemical
    Assemblies Thus far, we have discussed literature examples describing the noncovalent
    incorporation of agrochemicals into the hydrophobic interiors of amphiphilic polymer
    assemblies. However, there are major concerns for noncovalent encapsulation, including
    generally poor loading efficiency and instability after encapsulation, resulting
    in undesirable premature release of the active agent in biological systems. As
    an alternative, polymer–agrochemical conjugates have been investigated to address
    the aforementioned issues. Kwiecien et al. (60) synthesized a bioactive polymer
    by conjugating the herbicide 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)
    (PHBV). The resultant polymer–drug conjugate was then blended with poly(lactide)
    (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) at different ratios to prepare
    a biodegradable mulch. Their system exhibited slow release of the herbicide from
    the mulch for broadleaf weed suppression, on account of the slow degradation of
    the mulch film under glasshouse conditions. Biological targeting and activity
    of the MCPA–PHBV conjugate was investigated using the fava bean as a model crop,
    and the authors observed complete suppression of weed growth. In a later report,
    (61) an in-depth study of the same mulch system through energy-dispersive X-ray
    spectroscopy analysis suggested that the release of even 1% MCPA could effectively
    suppress weed growth; however, higher concentrations of the herbicide adversely
    affected several physiological parameters of the nontarget fava bean growth. One
    further important option for controlled delivery is to enhance the stability of
    the active agent through precise modification. Shang et al. (62) demonstrated
    improved pesticide photostability of emamectin benzoate following the formation
    of polymer nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were prepared by copolymerizing an
    N-acylated emamectin benzoate monomer with butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate
    using an emulsion polymerization technique. Experimental results showed that the
    obtained nanoparticles exhibited greatly improved photostability compared to the
    commercially available emamectin benzoate formulation. Additionally, laboratory
    toxicity tests demonstrated that the insecticidal effects of the pesticide–polymer
    conjugate were improved over those of the control formulation. 3.2. Synthetic-Biopolymer
    Hybrids One major drawback to the economic use of synthetic polymers is the residual
    material, which may be harmful to the environment. Attempts have been made to
    address this issue by preparing hybrid nanocarriers that combine synthetic polymers
    with natural polymers. In this regard, chitosan is one of the biopolymers widely
    explored due to its natural abundance and inherent antimicrobial properties. For
    example, Li et al. (63) studied the efficacy of an amphiphilic chitosan–poly(lactide)
    graft copolymer, where poly(lactide) was grafted onto the water-soluble chitosan
    to improve insecticide loading (Figure 2, polymer-1). The resultant amphiphilic
    polymer formed submicron nanoparticles that could encapsulate imidacloprid, giving
    a sustained release profile. In a later report, the same nanocarrier was utilized
    as a fungicide delivery system with the fungicide flusilazole loaded into the
    polymeric micelles via a modified nanoprecipitation method. (47) The authors reported
    that flusilazole was released by diffusion through the polymer matrix and that
    the nanoparticles successfully enhanced the activity of flusilazole by providing
    better penetration through grape leaves. Figure 2 Figure 2. Synthetic-biopolymer
    hybrids: structure of chitosan grafted polymers as mentioned in refs (63and64).
    Another interesting system (64) was prepared by conjugating the lipid 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
    (DPPE) to a chitosan-co-PLA graft copolymer for the controlled delivery of the
    organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (Figure 2, polymer-2). DPPE was chosen
    due to its high biocompatibility and ability to load the lipophilic chlorpyrifos
    with high efficiency. The nanoparticle size could be tuned by using either emulsion/solvent
    evaporation (218–283 nm) or nanoprecipitation (132–180 nm) techniques as well
    as by increasing the loading content, whereby size increased with higher loading
    due to a larger volume of the hydrophobic core. Chen et al. (65) demonstrated
    that it was possible to improve the mechanical properties and permeability of
    a cross-linked membrane of chitosan nanoparticles. The hydrophobic cross-linker
    suberoyl chloride was used to cross-link N-phthaloyl acylated chitosan, where
    the permeability of the chitosan membrane could be regulated by varying the degree
    of cross-linking (0 to 7.4%). Permeability was found to decrease gradually with
    an increase in cross-linking density due to a decrease in free volume in the cross-linked
    network. This system proved to be an excellent candidate for controlled release
    of various plant nutrients, including macroelements (N, P, K), microelements (Zn2+
    and Cu2+), and a plant growth regulator (1-naphthylacetic acid). Using a similar
    concept, pesticide-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by cross-linking chitosan
    with two different cross-linking agents, namely, glutaraldehyde (GLA) and tripolyphosphate
    (TPP). (66) Chitosan was cross-linked covalently with GLA, whereas TPP was incorporated
    noncovalently via electrostatic interactions. It was observed that the stability
    of the covalently cross-linked GLA–chitosan nanoparticles was higher than the
    noncovalently TPP cross-linked ones, but there was no significant difference in
    pest-control activity between the two. 3.3. Stimuli-Responsive Polymers With continually
    emerging developments in nanotechnology, stimuli-responsive polymeric smart materials
    have received considerable attention for their ability to deliver agrochemicals
    under specific microenvironment conditions in a self-regulated manner. Liang et
    al. (45) developed a pH-responsive system through electrostatic complexation between
    γ-polyglutamic acid and chitosan, followed by noncovalent cross-linking with TPP
    for the transport of the nematicide avermectin. At lower pH, the nanocarrier exhibited
    higher stability facilitated by strong electrostatic interactions between chitosan
    and the carboxyl groups of γ-polyglutamic acid, which subsequently diminished
    with an increase in pH (Figure 3a). The system showed an initial pH-independent
    release of 20% with an additional 69.5% release at pH 8.5, 60.4% at pH 7, and
    57.5% at pH 5.5. Figure 3 Figure 3. Representation of pH-responsive polymers.

    (b) Schematic representation of the assembly process of methomyl-loaded shell
    cross-linked nanocapsules. Reproduced with permission from ref (67). Copyright
    2014 Elsevier. Sun et al. (67) demonstrated a light-stimulated synthesis and pH-responsive
    release of an insecticide from methomyl-loaded chitosan nanocapsules to control
    armyworm larvae (Figure 3b). The nanocapsules were prepared by encapsulating hydrophilic
    methomyl inside the aqueous lumen of self-assembled nanocapsules of photo-cross-linkable
    azidobenzaldehyde-functionalized amphiphilic carboxymethyl chitosan, followed
    by UV irradiation to cross-link the membrane. More than 90% encapsulation efficiency
    of the nanocapsules was obtained at pH 4, attributed to the hydrogen bonding between
    methomyl molecules and carboxylic groups present on the inner surface of the polymer
    nanocapsules, whereas at higher pH (pH 6), disruption of H-bonding led to the
    diffusion-controlled release of methomyl, preventing burst release. The authors
    further varied the degree of cross-linking of the nanocapsules and found that
    the release rate was affected, whereby an increased degree of membrane cross-linking
    showed a slower release profile. Similarly, another chitosan-based photocontrolled
    agrochemical delivery system (68) was prepared by conjugating photolabile 2-nitrobenzyl
    functional groups to carboxymethyl chitosan. The modified polymer formed micelles
    in water and could be further cross-linked with dialdehyde to enhance the stability
    of the system (Figure 4a). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and dynamic
    light scattering (DLS) analysis confirmed the formation of micelles with a core–shell
    structure and an average diameter of 140 nm, and a herbicide could be encapsulated
    in the nanocapsules with very high encapsulation efficiency (∼92%). Experimental
    results revealed that the micelles were stable in aqueous solution at pH 7.0 with
    no detectable release in the absence of light irradiation, whereas upon exposure
    to solar irradiation, there was sustained release, showing 97% release over 8
    h in pH 7.0 buffer solution. Figure 4 Figure 4. Representation of photoresponsive

    of the 2,4-d-conjugated photoresponsive polymer as described in refs (71and72)
    (Color code: green, drug; red, photolabile group; blue, hydrophilic chain; black,
    hydrophobic chain). Using a completely different design strategy, Gao et al. (69)
    developed a pH-responsive system based on silica nanoparticles coated and functionalized
    with a poly(glycidyl methacrylate–acrylic acid) copolymer. The nanocarrier showed
    base-mediated agrochemical release due to the transformation of the surface carboxylic
    acid groups to carboxylate groups. The insecticide abamectin was loaded into the
    nanocarriers, and the release profile revealed that after 15 days at pH 5 and
    7 there was 14–15% release, whereas at pH 10, the release of the insecticide reached
    39% after 5 h and 87% after 15 days. Thus, the payload could be conserved on the
    crop surface but released rapidly upon ingestion by insect larvae, which have
    a basic midgut. Xu et al. (70) reported a dual responsive (NIR-light and temperature-sensitive)
    nanocarrier (Figure 4b) using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)-capped poly(dopamine)
    (PDA) microspheres. The release rate of imidacloprid was found to be strongly
    dependent on the temperature owing to the well-reported thermoresponsive nature
    of the NIPAm unit, with negligible release at 15 °C but increased release with
    rising temperature. It was also found that in the presence of NIR light irradiation,
    PDA experienced efficient photothermal conversion with a cumulative drug release
    (15.7% after 0.5 h compared with 5.2% without light). Such a dual stimuli-responsive
    drug release profile may be beneficial for identifying the best surrounding environmental
    conditions for the field application of these nanoformulations. Ding et al. developed
    (71) a photoresponsive system for the controlled delivery of herbicides, by conjugating
    2,4-D with PEG (PEG 4000/PEG 10000) via the photoresponsive spacer arm 3-nitro-4-bromomethylbenzoic
    acid (Figure 4c, polymer-3). The amphiphilic polymer–pesticide conjugate could
    self-assemble into core–shell micelles in water, and subsequently release 2,4-D
    upon exposure to UV irradiation due to photolysis of the polymer chains. Coumarin-based
    polymers, as light responsive smart delivery systems, also hold great interest
    for field applications. Atta et al. (72) synthesized two different types of polymers:
    the first by conjugating a coumarin-2,4-D unit onto PEG and the second by polymerizing
    an acrylate-based coumarin-2,4-D conjugate monomer (Figure 4c, polymer-4 and polymer-5,
    respectively). These polymers presented extended herbicidal activity with controlled
    release of 2,4-D under UV light. Overall, it is apparent that polymeric material-based
    nanoformulations have led to improved properties over conventional pesticides
    in terms of sustainable release, (63,65) stimuli-responsiveness, (45,67−72) solubility,
    (48,64) stability, (62,66) and targeted delivery. (60) It has become clear from
    these reported materials that the release rate of the active ingredients can be
    tuned by changing the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance (an increase in hydrophilicity
    increases the release rate) (52,54) or by varying the degree of cross-linking
    (an increase in cross-linking leads to slower release). (53,54) In addition, the
    size (generally a small size demonstrates faster release), (49,58) shape (no general
    conclusion can be made), (57−59) and surface porosity (56) of the polymer nanoparticles
    can all have significant effects on the agrochemical loading content and subsequent
    release properties. 4. Superabsorbent Polymers ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Superabsorbent
    polymers (SAPs) are three-dimensional cross-linked polymer networks that have
    the potential to absorb a large amount of fluid. (73) These materials are of growing
    interest in the agriculture sector, as they can effectively improve water retention
    and soil texture by regulating the evaporation and infiltration rates of water,
    and can also release water and nutrients to the plants. (74−77) In general, effective
    SAP materials should possess features such as (i) high fluid absorption capacity,
    (ii) high fluid retention, and (iii) high or regulated absorption rate. These
    features are reflected in the swelling capacity of the SAP materials and are greatly
    influenced by the mechanical strength of the material, cross-linking type, and
    extent of cross-linking. (78) There has been substantial focus on developing SAPs
    from natural polymers such as starch, cellulose, chitosan, and alginate due to
    their abundant raw resources; however, these polymers have poor mechanical strength
    and insufficient water capacity. (79) On the other hand, synthetic SAPs offer
    improved mechanical properties and facile tunability through changing the functional
    monomers. However, an SAP material for use in agricultural land for practical
    agriculture application should have a number of additional desired properties
    including (i) the highest absorption capacity with maximum equilibrium swelling
    in saline, (ii) the maximum absorption capacity under load, (iii) high durability
    and stability in the swelling environment and storage conditions, (iv) the ability
    to degrade without producing toxic byproducts, (v) not changing the pH of the
    soil, and (vi) cost-effective production. 4.1. Synthetic SAP In 1984, Erickson
    (80) first reported the application of SAPs prepared from various poly(alkyl acrylates)
    and poly(alkyl methacrylates) as soil conditioners, and ever since, scientists
    have continued to explore various superabsorbent polymers, including stimuli-responsive
    smart systems, (81) to improve their reversible water retention capacity. Synthetic
    polymers like poly(acrylamide)- and poly(vinyl alcohol)-based hydrogels have been
    utilized for field applications (mixed into soil/seed coating) and were found
    to be very effective for water retention over long periods with a greater survival
    rate of plants. (82−85) Dabbaghi et al. (86) reported a unique superabsorbent
    material prepared using functionalized tannic acid (TA), which is well known for
    its antimicrobial properties. Alkene-functionalized TA was used as an internal
    cross-linker for poly(acrylic acid), while epoxy-functionalized TA was used as
    the external cross-linker. A series of materials were prepared by varying the
    amount of internal and external cross-linker, and then their various properties
    were evaluated such as free swelling, absorbency under load, and gel content.
    These materials were confirmed as potential candidates for agricultural applications
    due to the additional advantage of excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive
    and Gram-negative bacteria. Cheng et al. (87) prepared a low-cost SAP by polymerizing
    acrylic acid (AA) in the presence of N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) and urea cross-linkers.
    By varying the mass ratio of each component, they optimized the material and found
    the highest water absorption (909 g/g) when using a 0.02% MBA to AA mass fraction
    with a 1.0 mol urea/mol AA ratio. The also evaluated the absorption behavior in
    the presence of different salt concentrations as well as the effect of SAP on
    different types of soils. The results highlighted that the addition of SAP to
    soils could significantly improve the water absorption and retention capacity
    of soils (20–25 times higher compared to the untreated soil) . Biodegradability
    is one of the important criteria of SAP materials for field applications in order
    to fulfill human economic necessities without amplifying waste accumulation. Researchers
    have sought to improve the biodegradability of such materials by the incorporation
    of biobased cross-linkers, hydrophilic segments, or charged functional groups.
    Stahl et al. (88) synthesized poly(acrylamide–acrylate) copolymer hydrogels and
    studied the rate of biodegradability of this superabsorbent material, and they
    observed superior biodegradation properties in soils compared to pure poly(acrylate).
    In another report, (89) poly(aspartic acid)-based polymer networks were studied
    and found to have an elevated capacity for biodegradation. 4.2. Synthetic-Biopolymer
    Hybrid SAP Although there has been a lot of research developing SAPs, their application
    has been limited due to their high cost, incipient toxicity, and detrimental effects
    on the environment. In recent years, SAPs prepared by combining synthetic polymers
    with natural polymers have gained popularity as they successfully address most
    of the aforementioned issues. One notable example reported poly(acrylamide) grafted
    onto chitosan, followed by cross-linking with MBA. (90) The properties and swelling
    profile of the material were optimized by changing the ratio of chitosan, MBA,
    and other reaction parameters. It was found that the maximum equilibrium swelling
    was achieved using a cross-linker ratio of 1% relative to the acrylamide. Like
    chitosan, polysaccharides are another important class of natural polymer that
    have been utilized for preparing SAP. For example, Mukerabigwi et al. (91) prepared
    a SAP by grafting poly(acrylic acid) onto xyloglucan polysaccharide chains and
    employing MBA as a cross-linker, and observed excellent water absorbance capacity
    under optimal conditions. Ahmed et al. (92) reported the synthesis of a superabsorbent
    hydrogel formed via graft copolymerization of carboxymethyl cellulose, acrylic
    acid, and acrylamide using MBA as cross-linker. This polymer conjugate demonstrated
    outstanding superabsorbent properties, having a swelling ratio of 190 g g–1. They
    further demonstrated the practical utility of this material by cultivating green
    peas in pots, whereby mixing 0.7% of the superabsorbent hydrogel with sand reduced
    water requirements by up to 25%. Importantly, there was improved plant growth
    in the presence of the SAP hydrogel under both full irrigation and drought. An
    alternate method to improve the mechanical properties of SAPs is to add fillers,
    such as the inclusion of inorganic or organic nanoparticles into polymer networks.
    One example describes the preparation of an SAP nanocomposite via the grafting
    of acrylic acid and acrylamide onto sodium alginate loaded with rice husk ash
    (RHA), a silica-based filler. (93) H-bonding interactions between the hydroxyl
    groups of the polymer and RHA provided additional cross-links within the 3D-hydrogel
    network, improving the mechanical strength of the hydrogel (Figure 5a). The swelling
    ability and salt resistance properties of the RHA–nanocomposite were higher than
    that of the hydrogel in the absence of filler; however, the swelling of both materials
    was significantly affected by solution pH and temperature. Figure 5 Figure 5.

    mechanism for the synthesis of HDP-g-AA/clinoptilolite SAPs. Reproduced with permission

    al. (94) synthesized a collagen-graft-poly(acrylic acid)/attapulgite superabsorbent
    composite by cross-linking acrylic acid-grafted starch with MBA in the presence
    of an attapulgite filler, which is known for its inherent water absorption properties.
    Similarly, clinoptilolite zeolites were used as the filler in a SAP prepared by
    the graft copolymerization of hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate (HDP) with acrylic
    acid (Figure 5b). (95) The study revealed that the surface morphology of the superabsorbent
    polymer could be improved with the incorporation of clinoptilolite, and as a result,
    the water absorbance was maximized (1210 g/g). Moreover, water retention experiments
    revealed that the optimum SAP in 100% sand had higher water retention, while SAP
    in 50% sand lost its absorbed water 49 days later than the control sample. 4.3.
    Controlled Release SAP SAPs have also attracted considerable attention as release
    formulations, as the combination of fertilizer/nutrients and superabsorbent properties
    can aid plant nutrition, along with soil conditioning by reducing the frequency
    of irrigation. Zhan et al. (96) reported the synthesis of a SAP by reacting phosphoric
    acid with poly(vinyl alcohol), where the resultant material was able to absorb
    and retain water and provide controlled release of phosphate as a fertilizer.
    In another example, (97) phosphorus was loaded onto smart SAP materials prepared
    by the polymerization of collagen, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid,
    and acrylic acid. The obtained polymer was then coordinated with Fe(III), where
    iron chelation caused additional noncovalent cross-linking, which reduced the
    water absorption capacity but enhanced the controlled release property of the
    loaded phosphorus fertilizer (Figure 6a). In an interesting report, Xu et al.
    (81) demonstrated an effective approach to prepare SAPs with high salt tolerance
    and pH responsiveness by grafting zwitterionic groups onto the polymer backbone
    (Figure 6b). Specifically, they prepared an amphoteric superabsorbent polymer
    by grafting acrylic acid onto collagen, a natural polymer, followed by cross-linking
    with dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (DMDAAC). This material showed pH-dependent,
    reversible swelling with responsive herbicide release properties. Figure 6 Figure

    ability of SAPs to effectively improve soil water retention, (92−94,98) soil condition,
    (87,99) and water-use efficiency. Furthermore, the carbon fixation rate in the
    early stage of plant growth and utilization efficiency of granular fertilizer
    (81,96,97) can also be improved. On the basis of the literature analysis, it is
    apparent that to improve SAP water capacity, more ionic functional groups (i.e.,
    −OH, −NH2, −COOH, −SO3H) need to be included, (100,101) whereas to improve the
    salt resistance, zwitterionic groups are needed. (81,102) Along with total absorption
    capacity and salt resistance, other important factors for ideal SAP such as good
    absorption under load, higher mechanical properties, and absorption rate have
    been investigated, and synthetic factors affecting these have been correlated
    in Table 2. Table 2. Effect of the Main Synthetic (Internal, Structural) Factors

    5. Other Applications: Inside Plants and Organisms ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To One
    of the leading challenges in agriculture is the growing demand for food, and plant
    bioengineering is one of the emerging strategies to address this need, by providing
    an effective pathway for breeding new varieties of crops with higher yields as
    well as qualities such as enhanced resistance to herbicides, insects, diseases,
    and drought. (103,104) There is also interest in polymer materials as vehicles
    for nanosensors, which can report on plant responses at a far greater level of
    detail than ever achieved previously. (105) A set of reports show convincing evidence
    that nanoparticles with hydrodynamic radii up to 100 nm are taken up into plants
    through the roots and are distributed by the plant vasculature. It is likely that
    the sites of ingress are the stomata in leaves, or the areas of damage around
    abrasions and tissue restructuring in roots when lateral roots push though living
    tissues to reach the soil. Evidence that nanoparticles can be transported within
    plants shows that the effective delivery of functionalized polymers is viable.
    (106) 5.1. Gene Transfection Although considerable progress has been achieved
    with regards to bioengineering techniques, the genetic transformation of plant
    species still remains a challenging task, primarily due to a lack of efficient
    delivery vectors that can transport genetic material into plant cells through
    their rigid and multilayered cell wall. (107) Polymeric materials have been widely
    explored as delivery vectors for biomedical applications, (108) whereas their
    potential for plant systems remains understudied, and only a few examples have
    been reported so far. Silva et al. (109) demonstrated the potential of conjugated
    polymer nanoparticles for effective siRNA delivery to target specific genes in
    the cellulose biosynthesis pathway. This study was performed using tobacco BY-2
    protoplasts (plant cells from which the cell wall has been removed) as a cell
    model; further investigations are required with intact plant cell walls. Jiang
    et al. (110) first reported the activity of a polymeric gene carrier in plants.
    They prepared different generations of polycationic dendrimers containing a central
    hydrophobic chromophore and evaluated the delivery efficiency in vivo, exploiting
    the fluorescent chromophore to track the nanoparticles within the plant. They
    chose two different double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), namely, shoot meristemless
    (dsSTM) and werewolf (dsWER), as these are expressed in the shoot apical meristem
    and are required for meristem formation and maintenance throughout the plant lifecycle.
    The dsRNA and dendrimer polyplexes were able to penetrate through the root wall
    into the plant cells, leading to a significant reduction in shoot apical meristem
    size and increased lateral roots. In another report, (111) a number of dimethylaminoethyl
    methacrylate (DMAEMA)-based cationic polymers (Figure 7a) were evaluated for plasmid
    DNA binding capacity, protection against nuclease degradation, and transfection
    efficiency to Ceratodon purpureus moss as well as Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts.
    However, in general, the exploration of functional polymers in this area is at
    a very preliminary stage and requires significantly more research focus. Figure
    7 Figure 7. Structure of the functional polymers used as a gene carrier and artificial
    photosynthesis. Structures of cationic polymers as described in (a) ref (109)
    and (b) ref (113). (c) Illustration of the strategy for augmenting the light reaction
    of isolated chloroplasts with conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs). Reproduced
    with permission from ref (119). Copyright 2017 John Wiley & Sons. Food sustainability
    also requires the control of biotic factors such as pests and diseases that limit
    crop productivity. (112) As we discussed above, the use of pesticides in combination
    with controlled delivery approaches can circumvent this issue; however, the long-term
    use of pesticides may still have adverse effects on human health and the environment.
    Recent studies in the area of gene silencing revealed that polymeric nanoparticles
    could successfully reduce the risks of pests and diseases by delivering silencing
    agents to these organisms, hence minimizing environmental hazards from agrochemicals.
    An additional advantage of this technique is the high specificity for the target
    species, thereby sparing nontarget organisms. Research has shown promising results;
    for example, Liu et al. (113) reported the synthesis of a macromolecular nanocarrier
    and demonstrated its efficacy for transfection of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrosis
    virus DNA (HaNPV) to specifically target the insect pest cotton bollworms. Cationic
    guanidine-based polymers have often been investigated for gene delivery as a result
    of their inherent propensity to form stable polyplexes with nucleic acids. Parsons
    et al. (114) reported the synthesis of a poly[N-(3-guanidinopropyl)methacrylamide]
    (PGPMA) polymer and evaluated the potency of the resultant nanocarrier for dsRNA
    delivery. The polymer alone was found to be nontoxic in a number of cell lines,
    while the polymer–dsRNA complexes were efficiently taken up by cells and showed
    effective gene knockdown in the larvae of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda, resulting
    in enhanced larval mortality. In another report by Christiaens et al., (115) a
    series of guanidine-containing random copolymers were synthesized through the
    copolymerization of N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylate hydrochloride, 2-(dimethylamino)
    ethyl methacrylate, and guanylated-methacrylate as well as a control homopolymer
    of the corresponding monomers (Figure 7b). Guanidine-containing polymer–dsRNA
    polyplexes conferred improved stability as well as enhanced cellular uptake of
    dsRNA in lepidopteran CF203 midgut cells. Stability tests were performed at pH
    11 to mimic conditions in the midgut, and the polymer–dsRNA complex was found
    to give strong protection against nucleolytic degradation for up to 30 h. In vivo
    experiments in S. exigua (beet army worm) resulted in a 53% increase in caterpillar
    mortality rate in comparison to a 16% mortality observed with the naked dsRNA.
    5.2. Augmented Photosynthesis A very different approach is bioprocess augmentation
    (nanobionics), and a prime example is research to enhance the photosynthetic efficiency
    of plants to improve crop productivity. Light absorption by chloroplasts is restricted
    to the visible spectrum, which greatly reduces the potential efficiency of solar
    energy. Some light-harvesting materials (116) can absorb UV light and then emit
    in the visible region of the spectrum, thus augmenting photosynthesis. Conjugated
    polymeric materials (117,118) appear to be compelling candidates for simulating
    this process. In order to demonstrate augmented photosynthesis in the presence
    of a light harvesting material, Wang et al. (119) prepared conjugated polymer
    nanoparticles (CPNs) containing two different fluorene blocks, namely, poly[2,7-(9,9-dihexylfluorene)-co-alt-p-phenylene]
    (PFP) and poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)]
    (PFBT). They found that the photosynthetic efficiency of the chloroplast/CPN complex
    was higher than for the natural chloroplast, as the former was able to capture
    a broader range of light including ultraviolet rays, thereby accelerating the
    electron transport rates in photosystem II (Figure 7c). 6. Conclusions and Perspective
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Functional polymers have certainly been demonstrated to
    have many possibilities for agricultural related applications, but there is a
    long way to go before full implementation of these materials. The biggest limiting
    factor is always likely to be cost; although advanced polymeric materials show
    great promise for smart agriculture, the increased complexity of materials will
    naturally raise production prices and hamper their usage in field applications.
    This has led to significant research in the development of hybrid polymeric materials,
    which have the desirable chemical properties associated with synthetic polymers,
    while the inclusion of natural polymers lowers costs of production. Additionally,
    the lack of real-world field testing of these functional polymers also hinders
    their commercialization. The majority of research thus far has been conducted
    either in greenhouses or in growth chambers because of complex and often demanding
    legislative processes. One of the most researched applications for polymeric materials
    has been agrochemical delivery. Despite the increased development of polymeric
    nanocarrier systems showing great potential for sustainable release as well as
    improved agrochemical stability, there are few products available on the market.
    One of the main factors influencing this low level of commercialization is that
    the great majority of studies are undertaken within universities and research
    institutes, which lack standard methods to validate agrochemical release profiles
    under field conditions. Another factor affecting the implementation of these materials
    is their high fabrication prices making them economically unviable. It is also
    possible that new nanobased products do not reach the market, as large companies
    are accumulating patents and waiting for opportunities for future exploitation
    following the development of more promising trading conditions. However, as with
    many other emerging technologies, it is expected that both societal priorities
    and national policies will change. In this case, it is likely that the pressure
    will increase for reducing the environmental impact of agriculture and this may
    open the door for new, smart products. It would be easy to make high-level comparisons
    between the fields of agriculture and biomedicine given their similarities in
    application requirements. However, biomedical applications focus on the treatment
    of humans as the final outcome, and usually, only two to three species of animal
    models are used for tests and trials, whereas for agricultural applications, the
    situation is far more complicated as this area deals with in excess of 7000 cultivated
    plant species (120) as well as countless pests and pathogens. During the last
    few decades, the number of studies related to agricultural science has strongly
    increased and numerous different nanoparticle delivery systems have been reported.
    As a result, researchers have been able to discern common factors for slowing
    agrochemical release rates, while retaining increased activity over the free compound,
    such as increasing nanoparticle hydrophobicity, size, and cross-linking density
    as well as reducing particle porosity. It is worth noting that many of these reported
    systems rely on physical encapsulation of agrochemicals, and there are only few
    reports of polymer–agrochemical conjugates, which may further affect release profiles.
    Ultimately, while factors affecting agrochemical release and activity have been
    identified across a range of plant species, the determination of the most effective
    nanocarrier system is more difficult, as results obtained on one type of plant
    species will not necessarily be valid for another. There has also been significant
    research into using SAPs as a means to control water retention in soil. From the
    wide range of SAPs reported, it has been possible to determine which chemical
    functionalities (such as ionic groups, which increase water absorbance, or zwitterionic
    groups, which increase salt resistance) and synthetic factors (such as cross-linking
    density, temperature, monomer, and initiator concentration) affect both absorption
    capacity and mechanical properties. While recent studies have mainly focused on
    agrochemical delivery and soil conditioning applications, which are likely to
    be used on a large scale, there are also emerging reports of niche, small-scale
    applications such as gene delivery and augmenting photosynthesis. We hope that
    continued research in these particular areas will yield greater understanding
    of the design parameters required to make these applications viable, as it has
    done for larger scale applications. With respect to agrochemical delivery and
    SAP, the progress that has been made toward synthesizing effective materials is
    promising; however, we believe the next key steps will include the identification
    of efficient cost-effective materials suitable for large-scale production. Additionally,
    the mitigation of any potential negative environmental impact from these materials
    will also be of the utmost importance for long-term sustainable agriculture. Author

    as revealed in November 2020 is 7.8 billion according to United Nations estimates.
    It is assessed that this number will projectile to 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.9
    billion by 2050. With the rapid growth in the total populace, food consumption
    is also growing rapidly worldwide. Agriculture is already producing about 17%
    more yield than it used to produce just three decades ago. However, about 821
    million people in the world suffer from a lack of food security. Increasing agriculture
    or food production rapidly for meeting the growing food supply demands is not
    an easy task. Several factors contribute to this problem, such as decade-old agriculture
    practices, poor storage, marketplaces, and political upheaval. As the global population
    is growing higher, the food and agriculture organizations calculate that agriculture
    production will need to increase by 70% by 2050 to feed the growing population
    of the world. It is not just about feeding people; we need to provide them with
    highly nutritious food without harming the environment. Since the volume of arable
    land is not increasing, the groundwater levels are going down, and the soil quality
    is not increasing, so we need to increase agriculture production responsibly.
    To deliver sustainable agriculture production, the agriculture sector needs to
    employ cutting-edge technologies like blockchain [1], [2], IoT [3], and AI [4].
    Data-driven agriculture with these technologies is the most promising approach
    to solve existing and future problems. If we could generate a huge quantity of
    data from the farm and use that data to drive some of the agricultural decisions.
    It can help to solve most of these food problems globally. For instance, if we
    could enable farms to build data sets or maps for soil moisture, temperature and
    humidity in the area, availability of water, and other environmental factors around
    the farm, it would enable techniques like smart farming, precision agriculture
    [4], vertical farming, etc. Data-driven agriculture has been shown to improve
    crop yield, reduce cost, and ensure sustainability [5]. These are not limited
    to agriculture but have potential solutions for several challenges faced by livestock
    farming also. Digitanimal is a company to enhance livestock farm productivity,
    sustainability, and animal welfare along with providing thorough monitoring solutions
    based on IoT wearable’s powered by firmware, AI, satellite images, and blockchain
    technology provides farmers with relevant information on health, location, feeding,
    and reproduction conditions of their animals. Thus by incorporating technological-based
    agriculture techniques increases their yield, reduces costs, and improves the
    income of farmers, thereby improves their quality of life. Smart agriculture deems
    it essential to address these problems that have attracted a lot of technological
    attention, from sowing to watering of crops to health, harvesting, and traceability
    in supply chain management. Figure 1 shows an overview of these technologies concerning
    the smart agriculture ecosystem. FIGURE 1. Illustration of smart agriculture ecosystem.
    Show All Big data empowers agricultural practitioners and related industries to
    gain information about different factors that influence agricultural production
    and take efficient decisions in daily farming. It keeps them up to date about
    the market price, demand of a particular crop, and the new technologies in the
    agriculture sector. Recently, big factory farms have embraced different technologies
    like IoT and blockchain with an intent to produce greater production in the farming
    practice. Blockchain technology is being implemented in the management of the
    agri-food supply chain to make available features such as transparency, security,
    immutability, and reliability of all operations. Blockchain also assists in addressing
    several IoT security and reliability challenges. IoT assists in data collection
    at each stage of agriculture production and supply chain [6]. Therefore, it would
    likewise be valuable to perform big data analytics on the data collected during
    farming, processing, logistics, and marketing. Information driven agrarian sector
    would significantly revolutionize farming and customer behavior. For example,
    mobile agriculture expert systems and agriculture predictive analytics all depend
    on big data to provide intelligent recommendations to growers towards precision
    agriculture. Precise risk evaluation could assist agriculture practitioners to
    better handle agriculture risks concerning production, market, institutional risk,
    accompanying individual and monetary risks. Furthermore, big data can be utilized
    to address several challenges like food safety, supply management, food security,
    along with food loss and wastage. Similar to other sectors, the agricultural industry
    has pursued innovations by employing convergence technologies. Big data and AI
    have demonstrated their potential and usage throughout the industry. However,
    agricultural big data faces various limitations as discussed in Section V of this
    paper. These limitations must be addressed to offer the right methodology of agricultural
    solutions for the next generation. Therefore, a strategy and a scheme for future
    advancement should be recognized by reviewing the latest developments, trends,
    and potential of technological innovations. In this article, we provide a comprehensive
    analysis to provide intuitions into important research works in smart agriculture
    employing big data and AI with an emphasis on precision farming. The prospective
    for exploiting big data and AI in processing actual field data for soil mapping,
    crop monitoring and estimation, sustainable resource utilization, disease and
    weed detection, weather monitoring, etc. in agriculture is extremely promising.
    Further, this paper provides a discussion on various available software tools
    for agriculture big data analysis and provides a discussion and comparison of
    different machine learning techniques in agriculture. Furthermore, we provide
    the complete discussion on data operational cycle right from data acquisition
    to decision making and implementation (actuation). We have also presented an in
    depth discussion on several potential applications and limitations of big data
    in precision agriculture. The remainder of the review article is systematized
    as follows. In section II, we present the overview of big data and AI technologies
    in precision agriculture. In section III, we present comparison and discussion
    on machine learning techniques in agriculture. In section VI, we described the
    big data operating cycle in agriculture environment. In section V, we report potential
    applications. Then, we deliberated some open issues and research areas in section
    VI. Lastly, section VII presents the conclusion of the paper. A. Research Methodology
    The primary purpose of this systematic review article is to identify pertinent
    research in the field of study. The research methodology process used in this
    systematic literature review consists of planning, implementing, and result investigation.
    The initial stage involves formulation of the review, recognizing its requirements,
    and outlining its rules including a) research questions, b) paper extraction,
    c) and selection of relevant papers for review. The second stage comprises extracting
    the relevant information from the selected papers. Lastly, present discussion,
    conclusion, and future work. We have identified some well-known digital libraries
    and web sources that we used to extract the relevant works mostly for 2000-2020.
    Table 1 presents the digital libraries and web sources. Table 2 contains some
    keywords and some concepts related to our field of study and used certain connectors
    to build search strings. On the subject of article selection, we start with papers
    that include keywords related to agriculture (such as agriculture, farming, smart
    agriculture, agri-chain, food-chain, etc.,) and others related to big data and
    AI. Then we rejected papers that are not relevant to the agriculture sector directly.
    Finally, we filter the papers for duplicated from different sources, other than
    the English language and student thesis. Thus, we obtained a total of 77 studies
    that are relevant to the research goal of this review article. TABLE 1 Digital
    Libraries and Web Sources TABLE 2 Keywords Utilized to Extract Relevant Papers
    During the Review SECTION II. Literature Review A. Artificial Intelligence The
    application of AI in the food sector is getting progressively significant owing
    to its capability to assist in minimizing food wastage, improves production hygiene,
    enhances the cleaning process of machines, disease, and pest control; therefore,
    there are numerous instances of employing AI and ML in the agri-food industry
    [7]. Automated frameworks can collect a huge amount of data in a matter of a few
    seconds on a single food item and analyze it rapidly. Even though agriculture
    practice is broad, some major areas of the agriculture sector where AI finds its
    application such as supply chain management, soil, crop, diseases, and pest management.
    References [8] summary all the proposed models using AI techniques with their
    limitations (a) for soil management: Fuzzy-logic based SRC-DSS (Soil Risk Characterization
    Decision Support System) [9] for soil classification, MOM (Management-oriented
    modeling) [10] for minimization of nitrate leaching, ANN (artificial neural network)
    [11] to estimate soil enzyme activity and soil structure classification, etc.,
    (b) for crop management: CALEX [12] to formulate scheduling guidelines, PROLOG
    [13] to remove redundant tools from the farm, ANN [14] to detect nutrition disorders
    in crops, ANN [15] to predict rice yield accurately, etc., (c) for disease management:
    computer vision system (CVS) [16] to detect multiple diseases at high speed, Fuzzy
    logic based database [16] are accurate in test environments, ANN-GIS [17] has
    got an accuracy of 90%, the expert system using rule-base in disease detection
    [18] for faster detection and treatment of disease, etc., (d) for weed control:
    invasive weed optimization (IWO) [19], big data abased ANN-GA [20], support vector
    machine [21], etc. All these methods did not consider all the parameters; they
    are all application-specific towards a particular crop or environmental parameter.
    There is an need to design AI frameworks using multiple parameters and that can
    be used for multiple crops. B. Big Data Analytics Big data analysis is outlined
    as a system in which cutting-edge analytic methods operate on huge data sets.
    Therefore, it is a combination of two technical entities massive amount of data
    sets, and a collection of analytics tool categories including data mining, statistics,
    AI, predictive analytics, natural language processing (NLP), etc. forming an important
    component of business intelligence. Lately, big data turn out to be a subject
    of broad and current interest equally in academic research and industry. It characterizes
    enormous and unstructured data generated by a large number of sources. Several
    out of the most prevalent data processing techniques employ big data techniques.
    Big data is depicted by the subsequent attributes which are shown in figure 2.
    Big data is being used in numerous fields such as big services business industries
    like Amazon to learn customer behavior and needs more precisely to tailor product
    prices accordingly, enhance operational productivity, and cut down personal costs.
    Even social networking sites Facebook, Twitter, and other networking sites utilize
    big data analytics to study your social behavior, interests, and social connections
    and then endorse the specific products. In an intelligent transportation system,
    big data techniques can handle the enormous quantity of diverse and complex data
    generated over the period to provide safe and superior facilities aimed at drivers
    and passengers in the transportation system. In the agriculture field, big data
    shows a huge potential for solving many challenges of farming and consequently
    boosting the agriculture production quality and quantity. Big data analytics can
    be used to determine the soil quality, diseases and pest interruption, water requirement,
    and can predict harvesting time for crops. FIGURE 2. Big data characteristics
    (10 V’s). Show All There has been a critical pattern to ruminate about the utilization
    of massive data procedures and strategies to agribusiness as a significant opportunity
    for utilization of the ICT pack, for financing, and for achieving added significance
    inside the agriculture sector [22] [23]–[26]. Applications of massive data in
    agriculture are not sternly regarding primary cultivation, but also assume a significant
    part in enhancing the effectiveness of the whole supply chain, thus reduces food
    security worries [23], [24]. Right now, discussion on the applications of big
    data present in literature is occurring fundamentally in America [27], Canada
    [28], Europe [29], and China [30], [26]. Considering the developing consideration
    and interest that appeared in the different works, nonetheless, the number of
    use cases is likely to grow promptly in different nations like Australia [31],
    Morocco [24], etc. Massive data is the center of in-depth, progressed, game-evolving
    business intelligence, at a scale and speed that the old methodology of duplicating
    and removing every last bit of it into a warehouse is not, at this point, appropriate.
    Prospects for Big Data use in agribusiness incorporate benchmarking, IoT-based
    sensor network implementation and analytics, prediction models, and utilizing
    enhanced models to oversee crop failure risks and to lift feed efficacy in livestock
    farming. Thus, big data technology is to offer prescient insights to upcoming
    farming outcomes, enables real-time effective decision making, and modernize business
    measures for rapid, state-of-the-art actions, and game-changing business models
    [32]. Big data is predicted to modify both the degree and the organization of
    agriculture [33]. While there are questions about whether agriculture practitioners’
    information is going to be supplanted by algorithms, applications of Big Data
    are probably going to change how agriculture farms are managed and operated [28],
    [34]. Key domains of progress for precision agriculture such as real-time forecasting,
    tracing of agri-food products, and remodeling of business practices [35]. More
    extensive big data application is probably going to transform both farm organizations
    and the more extensive supply chain in unfamiliar ways. SECTION III. Comparision
    and Discussion on Machine Learning Techniques in Agriculture There is a broad
    literature on different machine learning algorithms that have been employed in
    diverse application areas in agriculture. Identifying the ideal method for guaranteeing
    accuracy and constancy for a specific application in agriculture is significant.
    SVRs demonstrated robustness with outliers and noise presence with better estimation
    accuracy upon comparison with ANN [36]. ANN and SVRs when used for mapping of
    soil organic stocks (SOC) produced comparable performance [37]. Several regression
    models were evaluated to find appropriate techniques that realize great accuracy
    and better generality for yield prediction abilities. Neural networks, despite
    their site-dependency, ascertained robustly, however, the SVR model employed was
    highly accurate though being fast computationally [38]. ANNs, RFs, and SVMs have
    mostly been testified as classifiers, yielding great accuracies [39], [40]. Deep
    learning techniques are the utmost promising models for segmentation applications
    of agriculture image data sets. Finally, in Table 3 we discuss the reliability
    issues, computational characteristics, and threads of analysis of the models explained.
    TABLE 3 Comparison and Discussion on Machine Learning Techniques Graphical models
    are not apprehensive towards input-output pattern modeling; however, they model
    autocorrelation between the input parameters (variables) [41], [41]. There exist
    several variants of GMs that model data based on input-output interdependencies,
    for instance, conditional random fields (CRFs) [43], [44]. CRFs take up probabilistic
    systems unlike NNs and SVMs; i.e., they form input-out variable relations by a
    probability distribution P(Y | X), instead of a definite capacity of the configuration
    Y = f (X). Though, having a similar fundamental principle; the models learn the
    P(Y | X), upon provided with training data (Xi, Yi), i = 1, 2,.., n by optimizing
    a proper loss function. Upon learning the best probability distribution from the
    training data, inference can be performed to estimate the target output. In agriculture,
    GMs show a substantial potential for modeling big data applications such as spatial
    disease distribution [45], operational decisions, modeling traits, etc. The most
    specific challenges that occur with ML in precision agriculture are variable spatial-temporal
    resolutions and missing due to several reasons like IoT device malfunctioning,
    communication failure, bad weather prevented remote sensing image acquisition,
    etc. It is in this way important to have AI models that can adapt to missing information.
    All the recent ML and DL models designed for plant disease and pest detection
    are not suitable for the early detection of diseases and pests, thus unable to
    prevent the crops from early disease and pest attacks. Thus, deep learning models
    for the early classification of plant diseases and pests are important. DL and
    CNNs have been progressively more employed in agriculture remote sensing applications
    [46]–[48]. CNN needs a hefty volume of data towards generating hierarchical features
    to make available semantic statistics at the output [49]. With the expanding access
    to enormous quantities of aerial images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [50]
    and satellites, CNNs can assume a significant part in the analyses of all this
    information to extract significant information. Though, the UAV-based technological
    adaption by farmers for specialty crops is very low [51]. There are two facades
    for low adaption such as preprocessing and analysis of data, as it is very complex
    and time-consuming to produce precise and suitable information and the inability
    of available commercial tools to create enough useful information from the data
    for specialty crops. As UAVs can accumulate a large and unstructured quantity
    of data, big data-based tools (analytics tools) and cloud computing has the potential
    to enhance the data processing efficacy, offer high data security, and scalability,
    and minimize cost. Applications based on cloud computing act as a potential solution
    having low upfront cost, proficient utilization of computational resources, and
    service costs [52]. UAVs with big data analytics methods such as CNNs can be used
    to detect tree characteristics (height, tree health, species, canopy area, etc.),
    leaf disease, crop estimation, etc. Soil quality performs a significant part in
    influencing how healthy plants develop. Indeed, different types of plants grow
    in different soil conditions or types. Understanding the diverse characteristics
    such as texture, structure, and chemistry of soil assists agriculture practitioners
    to choose the best quality crops to cultivate in their farms. To study these characteristics
    of soil, IoT, and other sensor networks along with ML-based big data techniques
    like clustering and classification methods to label soil data. Spark Mlib comprising
    of several ML algorithms and utilities including logistic regression, and naive
    Bayes in classification, K-means, GMMs in logistics. Likewise, distributed parallel
    association rule mining techniques can be used to determine the growth of plants.
    SECTION IV. Big Data Operating Cycle in the Agriculture Environment The above
    discussion on the existing work on smart agriculture and the potential of integrating
    evolving technologies namely AI and big data to bring revolutionary changes, benefits
    and solve many problems of sustainable agriculture. In the technologically advanced
    big industrial farms, field management looks different from the traditional farms
    following the operating cycle represented in figure 3. In these smart farms, the
    management system employing smart decision-making by processing actual field data
    by deriving benefits of its inner variability (including both time and spatial-wise).
    The objective field data acquisition is done by deploying IoT devices, remote
    sensing, and other sensor networks. The data collected about soil, crops, weather,
    or ambient from the IoT sensor networks is stored on local or cloud storage. Where
    ML-based big data algorithms are used to abstract vital information and helping
    incorrect decision-making by the farmer. Finally, the required action recommended
    by the decision system is executed physically by the advanced machinery used based
    on the decision received through an intelligent control system. This cycle of
    processes remains repeating systematically till the harvesting stage. FIGURE 3.
    Big data-based precision agriculture system representation. Show All The ML-based
    big data analytic tools [53] such as ANN, PROLOG, TOMRA, etc., at the processing
    stage, are used to abstract the significant information about the quality of soil
    like nutrient level and pH, analyze seed characteristics, sorting of food, the
    weather patterns, and the existence of food hazards by relating biotic or abiotic
    data with development and probabilistic existence of pathogens, pests, and toxicants.
    The different stages of this precision agriculture system are discussed in successive
    paragraphs below: There is always assumed some level of spatial variability naturally
    for crop fields to existing irrespective of what way the crops will be managed.
    The weather of a current production year and the previous successive years influence
    the natural spatial variability, data from the previous numerous years can be
    fused to determine interested parameter trends, and therefore data turn out to
    be important for farm management. Thus, the need for crop monitoring arises from
    the presence of variability; however, these variabilities require to be managed
    by a grower efficiently. Management zones having homogeneous characteristics are
    developed in a field to custom-made field practices for each subfield zones, ensuing
    in a realistic and economical method to precision agriculture. Thus, the implementation
    of subfield zones would cut the fertilizing cost, yield improvement, lessens pesticide
    usage, helps in building superior farm records, and make available vital data
    for decision making. The size of the field decides the natural variability function
    and subsequently determines the size of these management zones and management
    factors. The selection of several specific parameters to be pursued should be
    done at the early stage of the process. However, some use cases with very low
    spatial variability might be there in which a distinct mapping event can be satisfactory.
    Different IoT sensors apart from traditional sensors are used for crop monitoring
    and collecting required important data from them. These sensor devices can be
    directly deployed in the fields, agriculture robots, autonomous platforms, machines,
    or weather stations. Different parameters can be calculated in real-time by using
    IoT sensor networks [54] enabled with a high-speed data network. Remote sensing
    from artificial satellites has performed a vital part in the development of precision
    farming by making field data remotely accessible. American Landsat satellites,
    the European Sentinel 2 system, RapidEye constellation satellite system, GeoEye-1
    system, and WorldView-3 are the important satellites supplying agriculture [55]
    data in the form of multispectral data, multispectral RGB imagery, RGB and NIR
    data, etc. The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (Drones and Remotely-piloted
    Aircrafts) in agriculture production is gradually increasing as a measure of an
    efficient method to sustainable agricultural management allowing growers, agri-engineers,
    and agronomists to assist simplify their procedures, utilizing robust information
    analytics to achieve valuable insights into their crops. Drones have made careful
    crop monitoring easier over large areas of agricultural lands, in identifying
    suitable crop recommendations, the emergence of plant and population, as more
    precise data can assist in decisions regarding replanting, pruning, and thinning
    activities, and yield estimation. UAV’s) [50] are very useful but still face certain
    challenges such as carry a limited payload, limit the use of sensors onboard,
    challenging data and image post-processing, vegetation shadowing during gathering
    imagery data, etc. In proximal sensing, the ground platforms such as Unmanned
    ground vehicles (UGV) and robots that operate close to crops increase the accuracy
    of acquired data and one or two high resolutions of samples per unit area are
    reasonable [56]. With UGVs applications requesting real-time data like weed detection
    and removal, selective pesticide spraying, soil analysis, pest control, and crop
    scouting are possible. Scouting robots are used for performing specific tasks
    such as robot Oz (mechanical weeding), GUSS autonomous sprayer, RowBot system
    (fertilizing, mapping, seeding, etc.), VineRobot (vineyard management), etc. Researchers
    and industries are working on different projects to converge UAV and UGV for better
    sustainable development. The application of different wireless data collection
    technologies has created massive data in agriculture. But the huge quantity of
    data poses a significant challenge to manage, as important information may be
    imperceptible by noise. Presenting information in a coherent shape is vital for
    end-users to comprehend the different processes in the field [57]. Mapping is
    the most useful technique to express spatial developments and homogeneous subfields
    from the agriculture data. Maps assist in creating management zones with interesting
    parameters for the efficient application of custom-made field practices for each
    subfield zones. Kriging is a commonly used interpolation method to get manageable
    size subfields. Considering the enormous quantity of data generated by smart agriculture,
    there is several software applications employed to handle interpolation. Local
    Tangent Plane (LTP) [58] featuring Euclidean geometry enables a user to establish
    origins and utilizes intuitive coordinate set up east-north. The systematic quantization
    of the LTP coordinates is allowed by grids in maps in the efficient management
    of agriculture production data enables the data sharing among succeeding seasons,
    and different field parameters of a management zone. Software-based farm management
    solutions [59] for instance Geographic Information Systems (GIS) encourage the
    automation of data collection and analysis, supervising, planning, record keeping,
    decision making, and farm operation management. These tools also help in basic
    tasks for record-keeping such as produce harvests and yields, scheduling farm
    tasks, profits-losses, tracking of soil nutrients, weather prediction, and mapping
    of the field, and other complicated functions for automating field management.
    A specific GIS data management system [60] known as farm management information
    system (FMIS) was developed for different applications of precision agriculture.
    FMIS helps growers with several tasks like operational planning, record keeping,
    implementation, and evaluation of executed fieldwork. Its objective is to decrease
    costs of production, comply with farming standards, great product quality, and
    safety maintenance, and supervising the farmers to make the best decisions. There
    are several commercial agriculture information management systems for instance
    ADAPT, WinGIS, SpiderWeb GIS, AGERmetrix, FieldView, SST software, AgVerdict Inc.,
    Trimble, etc. addressed not only for farmers or producers, nonetheless to other
    participants’ in the agriculture sector i.e., in the agriculture supply chain
    from farm to fork. However, the efficiency of recommendations from these software
    tools depends upon the parameters encompassed in the design of algorithms of that
    particular software platform. For example, DSSAT produces outputs by taking experimental
    data for crop model evaluations, permitting users or growers to compare the simulated
    results and observed results, which is significant if real-world decisions are
    established on modeled outcomes. There are other wide varieties of big data analysis
    software tools available in agriculture [61] (see Figure 4). FIGURE 4. Software
    tools employed in agriculture big data analysis. Show All FIGURE 5. Big data-based
    decision support system. Show All It is practically difficult for people to manage
    complex agriculture data to make better decisions due to several field parameters
    involved in farm management. In such scenarios, AI with DL, genetic algorithms,
    ML, or expert systems can assist with its reasoning, and modeling abilities can
    perform a vital role in precision farming, facilitating to understand of all the
    available data. Therefore, precision agriculture presents a huge application space
    for all types of core technologies in AI because agents functioning in uncontrolled
    situations. A fuzzy logic-based decision support system is designed in [62] for
    kiwi, potato, and corn with input variable parameters as rain forecast and soil
    moisture. Likewise, [63] developed a DSS to estimate the weekly irrigation requirement
    for citrus orchards by taking soil moisture and climate data; it uses a real-time
    soil parameter measurement control system to avoid errors. DSS is the most robust
    and dependable by considering several parameters, however, some processes stay
    controversial as different objectives can result in diverse solutions at different
    times depending on the need set by users or others engaged with the procedure.
    Numerous DSS systems have been proposed in the literature considering different
    use cases having different objectives. Thus, the use of DSS tools is influenced
    by their usability, performance, cost-viability, significance to growers, and
    suitability with compliance requests. The application of software tools for decision-making
    in precision agriculture is considered valuable as these tools enhance management
    efficiency than other tools. Though, there is yet far to make innovation-based
    tools adequately attractive, simple, intuitive, and nice for farmers to adopt.
    On the other hand, producers need to be trained appropriately until these technological
    tools can be easily managed. Actuation on the crop is the last step to complete
    the crop management cycle as shown in figure 3. It is done by considering the
    recommendations of the DSS through advanced equipment’s/machines able to receive
    data signals from the control unit. Variable-rate machines are capable of executing
    several agriculture errands operated by automatic systems. The application of
    variable rate technology (VRT) for site-specific crop management (SSCM) can improve
    profit and diminish the environmental impact by executing tasks precisely. Delineation
    technique usage in management zones can increase the efficiency of farms for instance
    applied delineation methods for variable rate nutrient use cases, which enhances
    the farm efficacy than traditional uniform-rate use cases, and impact on the environment
    was minimized. Different machinery manufacturing companies such as CLAAS, CEBIS
    MOBILE ISOBUS, etc. are developing various VRT based commercial solutions to perform
    different applications of precision agriculture. Variable-rate harvesting (VRH)
    or automatic differential harvesting is the other type of variable actuation,
    which tries to harvest according to initially specified management zones. Other
    than efficiency and usefulness, the cost is one of the vital parameters to reflect
    for the acceptance of these technologies. Thus, the pervasive availability of
    economical electronic components will favor the adoption of these digital applications
    throughout the world including small farm holders. SECTION V. Prospectus of Big
    Data and AI in Precision Agriculture A. Big Data-Based Decision Support System
    for Crop Selection The proposed system architecture maintains the data collected
    at every stage of agriculture production and supply chains such as soil moisture,
    weather, and environment data, crop yield and harvest, demand and supply data
    from the supply chain, food processing data from food processing industries, and
    pesticides used by the farmer. Figure 4 represents the overview of the decision
    support system for crop selection in the proposed system. This data is at cloud
    storage and other local databases, are used to abstract the relevant information
    about the quality of soil like nutrient level and pH, analyze seed characteristics,
    sorting of food, the weather patterns, marketing and trade management, and the
    existence of food hazards by relating biotic or abiotic data with development
    and probabilistic existence of pathogens, pests, and toxicants. Big data analytics
    recommend the best appropriate crop for agriculture practitioners to select for
    which there will be demand. The system keeps track and maps the crops with the
    corresponding demand and prevents farmers from overabundance harvesting of the
    crops with the predicted demand. B. Crop Management, Growth Monitoring, and Produce
    Quality The raw estimation of vital parameters from the farm data necessities
    to be processed efficiently to convert numbers and pictures into beneficial info.
    The growth and quality of the crops can be monitored from the image data collected
    from the farm and then applying different image processing techniques such as
    OpenCV, Matplotlib, Sciki-image, etc., in Python. We can measure the height and
    width of plants along with the quality of the crops by extracting the different
    features of crops based on the color of the leaves and crops from the images.
    In the meantime, other IoT devices are used to collect all other environmental
    parameters and are stored in the cloud. IoT networks deployed in the food processing
    industries collect information about each step in food production from the quality
    of raw material used to other ingredients used to produce the final food product.
    All these values can be stored in the network in any file format such as CSV file
    format, etc. After initial analysis and determination of how indispensable the
    extracted features are. We can employ some of the abstracted data to train our
    machine learning or deep learning models. Then these trained deep learning algorithms/models
    are used to extract the required features from large data sets collected from
    the field. The crop yield estimation targets to analyze factors that affect and
    influence the production, like irrigation, natural soil composition, and its physical
    structure and topography, climate and weather, crop stress, crop diseases, and
    pests, etc. It facilitates efficient management of resources; a timely and precise
    estimation of products can offer a reliable base to decision-makers to ascertain
    if there will be a scarcity or excess, therefore, to respond appropriately according
    to the conditions. C. Sustainable Use of Resources Driving advancements in the
    technologies, such as AI, IoT, and drones using big data in its processes to increasingly
    enhance sustainability in agriculture. Since the volume of arable land is not
    increasing, the groundwater levels are going down, and the soil quality is not
    increasing these technologies could make sure optimal utilization of arable land,
    water, and other resources to meet global requirements at the same time conserving
    resources for the future generations. Thus, big data have the potential to provide
    solutions (practical and scalable) that can assist in natural resource conservation,
    thus could sustain agriculture. D. Reduce Pesticide Usage With the implementation
    application of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, agriculture practitioners
    can employ AI to manage weeds. From the data collected from the farms with the
    help of IoT devices, AI can assist in data abstraction to locate the weeds in
    fields and spray only to the specified locations where the weeds are. Thus, reduces
    the consumption of pesticide spraying an entire field and leaves less chemical
    on the agriculture produce relatively the amount of chemicals typically sprayed.
    E. Plant Disease Detection Agriculture production and quality face a major threat
    from plant diseases. Recently, several deep learning-based neural networks have
    been developed to identify plant diseases but all the models work when the diseases
    are fully developed in the crop and thus have minimum effect on increasing the
    quality of the produce. In the fields, plant disease detection and monitoring
    at early stages are difficult, time extensive, and costly. But to increase the
    crop quality and yield, deep learning algorithms for timely classification and
    recognition of disease are required. This can be achieved by preparing plant pathology
    datasets with diseases in the early stages. F. System for Risk Management Managing
    risks because of the farm location, type of soil, and mostly to heat stress or
    freeze involves essential significance in precision agriculture. A particular
    condition for cultivation is the impact of the climate and particularly its volatility.
    The amalgamation of different datasets is a critical process for data interpretation
    for this use case. Provincial climate patterns are utilized to join data from
    global patterns with local and provincial meteorological histories to give climate
    information to more modest spatial units and support real-time adoption of the
    environment and climate changes. For example, [64] discussed a situation of big
    data employed in the forecasting of rainfall by taking benefits of meteorological
    big datasets. The outcomes show a considerable prospective of data fusion in precision
    agriculture. G. Agriculture Management System ICT empowers farmers to share data,
    set up collaboration, and work together. As agriculture practitioners become connected,
    software-defined management frameworks arise. Rural administration frameworks
    emerge to give accounting administrations, linking growers with farm owners and
    administrators, and offer benchmarking capacities to agriculturalists by associating
    them. Their point is to support farm administrators and agribusinesses throughout
    the world, incorporate, and examine a tremendous quantity of information from
    real-time sources to help their decisions in business. Such frameworks give smart
    cultivating solutions. Smart cultivating is a term that broadens precision agriculture
    by putting together administration errands concerning handle explicit information
    as well as information upgraded by setting and circumstance awareness, set off
    by real-time events [61]. Taking examples of studies conducted on small farms
    in the developing world specify that farmers are unable to trade their produce
    because of oversupply or inadequate information. Tools for higher productivity
    and require estimations can facilitate crops to be incorporated into the global
    supply chain [62]. SECTION VI. Big Data Challenges in Precision Agriculture Gathering
    and examining huge data produced via IoT networks and wireless sensor networks,
    comprising digital images and more data from UAVs, satellites, and data fusion
    with existing data present difficulties to the effective execution of smart farming.
    Arising technologies about data mining techniques and artificial intelligence
    techniques are potential methods to achieve intuitions from said information [61],
    [63]–[67]. These techniques can assist with dissecting greater and more unpredictable
    information, uncover covered-up models, and uncover trends quickly and precisely.
    The capability of these strategies in massive data investigation has not been
    sufficiently valued in farming for various reasons inspected underneath. The greater
    part of the accessible open frameworks referenced already result from the latest
    projects, their issue is still extensively wide embraced, to conclude the final
    accomplishment. Large numbers of them may in any case be underdeveloped and have
    not attained their maximum capacity yet. Most of these applications of big data
    are suited for large industrial farms (such as Monsanto) that now employ big data
    in process of decision making and have the infrastructure to access data, resources,
    and most importantly access to finance [68]. There is very little work done on
    small farms around the developing world. Big data has the potential to support
    non-industrial farms, however moral and ethical queries regarding availability,
    cost, and funding need to be addressed to attain these advantages. If this trend
    continues, the benefits from data-driven precision agriculture will remain available
    to only big industrial farms. A. Data Collection Challenges In precision agriculture
    use cases, enormous data is generated from different sources. Merging data from
    an assortment of sources raises worries about the issue of information quality
    and information merging, and the access to gathered huge information raises apprehensions
    about safety and protection. Data-driven techniques request uncontaminated and
    applicable information be used. Incomplete datasets obliterated information, and
    the presence of exceptions or inclinations in the training set influences model
    precisions. The analysis of information quality requests critical human contribution
    and expert knowledge. However, even semi-computerized approaches are not useful
    concerning huge volumes of information. The act of large information assortment
    likewise increases apprehensions over availability and security. The capability
    of academicians and researchers to perform big-data-oriented examinations firmly
    relies upon the accessibility of farm data. Suggestions for administering security,
    ownership of data, protection of data, and information use ought to be set by
    farmers’ coalitions and farming technology suppliers. B. Challenges in Big Data
    Analysis Techniques Big data requires extraordinary methods to proficiently process
    a huge quantity of data with infinite running time. Hypothesis analysis and ML
    are the largely employed methods for data exploration [69]. Agricultural data
    analysis is mostly statistical. AI techniques do not consider any pre-established
    relations among variables from the hypothesis however start from the data to look
    for potential connections between variables [70], [71]. The gathered datasets
    are huge and complex making it hard to manage normal AI procedures. Such methods
    regularly perform inadequately when applied to agricultural data. Scalable and
    versatile methods are expected to adapt to voluminous information. Besides, enormous
    information gathered in agriculture disrupt normal suppositions basic a few AI
    and analytic techniques, for example, the independence and identical distribution
    of data. Big data generated from farms shows spatial-temporal autocorrelation,
    has heterogeneity and high dimensionality, is nonstationary, and as a rule, must
    be handled in a constant manner [61], [72]. To control the datasets that go along
    with precision or smart farming, analytics techniques need to an extent in aligned
    and distributed means, high computational complication. Technological developments
    in cloud computing capabilities and distributed storage models can assist in this
    course. Distributed computing may be employed to incorporate data sources in various
    areas, and afterward, the data can be apportioned into an appropriated and parallel
    model. The integration of AI and distributed computing execution procedures gives
    potential approaches to deal with huge data. Established models, ought to remain
    compatible with distributed computing, but not all AI models are suitable for
    execution in distributed form. As an effective model, parallel SVM (PSVM) [73]
    decreases memory and time utilization and in [74] a versatile AI administration
    is presented for stream handling and real-time processing. C. Availability of
    Computing Infrastructure Apart from novel analytical standards for information
    abstraction from big data-compatible distributed frameworks and advanced wireless
    communication solutions are also required to implement big data in precision agriculture.
    Management of farms faces several challenges in executing real-time analysis and
    delivery of heterogeneous and multi-dimensional data channels from various sensor
    networks [75] Platforms for real-time data analysis are required to manage data
    collected from remote sensing online and fuse offline data with it from other
    distributed data sources. Since precision farming greatly depends on event monitoring
    this necessitates data analysis and therefore needs lesser latency and greater
    bandwidth. Hadoop (open source) is right for parallel processing and applications
    for execution of cutting-edge analytics on enormous data stored have mostly developed
    on Hadoop (Apache Software Foundation, 2019b). However, Hadoop is inappropriate
    for real-time data processing applications. Apache Storm, Spark, and Flink are
    appropriate for real-time data stream processing. Several modules such as Mlib
    and GraphLab for providing ML operations, while Tensorflow like tools are intended
    to develop sophisticated ML models such as CNNs, and DNNs. D. Managing Growing
    Data and Real-Time Scalability An immense quantity of images and video is produced
    progressively through several devices during plant growth monitoring, which prompts
    several challenges in storing and processing all that data. Moreover, most of
    the data generated in agriculture are amorphous or semi-structured, not stable
    for storing in customary databases like MySQL, SQL Server. Management of such
    enormous unstructured data is considered a big challenge. It is imperative to
    give consumers visual data in a real-time mode to empower them with efficient
    fast decision-making capabilities. This demands advanced big data platforms with
    real-time data handling capabilities across the network stages such as collecting,
    processing or analyzing, and visualizing. But real-time analyzing such an enormous
    amount of data is challenging near the source due to inefficient computing infrastructure.
    E. Data Management Landscape Uncertainty One disruptive aspect of massive data
    is the utilization of variability of advanced data management techniques whose
    intentions are to strengthen operational and analytical processing significantly.
    These methodologies are generally grouped into the NoSQL framework category that
    is distinguished from a traditional relational storage management system. There
    are various NoSQL methods. Some support a hierarchical object interpretation employing
    standing encoding techniques like XML, BSON, or JSON related to respectively managed
    data entities while others are using the key-value concept of data storage, fundamentally
    supporting a schema-less model. Databases based on graphs maintain the interrelated
    relationships between various objects. And several other standards are evolving
    continuously. In fact, inside every one of these NoSQL classifications, many models
    are being created by several organizations both for-profit and nonprofit. Each
    approach is fit diversely to key performance measurements—a few models give extraordinary
    adaptability; others are excellently scalable as far as execution while others
    support a more extensive scope of functionality. To be specific, the wide assortment
    of NoSQL tools and designers, and the market status impart a prominent level of
    uncertainty to the data management landscape. Selecting a NoSQL technique is difficult,
    but choosing the wrong data management framework can result in enormous errors
    and loss if the selected NoSQL tool from a particular organization doesn’t satisfy
    the expectations or if a different data management system is adopted by a third
    party for application development. Therefore, to select big data management techniques
    users need to consider their respective applications and performance requirements
    along with the mitigation of risks of the underlining technology. SECTION VII.
    Conclusion and Recommendations The ever-growing accessibility of information through
    developments in ICT appears promising for improving innovations on indispensable
    decision-making through enhancing precision and generalization capability of models.
    Besides, learning from the enormous quantity of data generated from precision
    agriculture practices is anticipated to create substantial opportunities and transformational
    perspectives for precision farming. With the advancement in big data, traditional
    learning methods are not naturally proficient or scalable adequately to process
    huge quantities of heterogeneous, multi-dimensional, and spatiotemporal data.
    Innovative ML techniques such as CNN, big data analysis methods present higher
    precision, flexibility, vigor, and performance. We have provided a comparison
    and discussion on the different ML techniques in precision agriculture. Agriculture
    production challenges are growing, creating the necessity to comprehend the complicated
    agriculture environments more crucial than ever before. Several ML techniques
    due to their data mining capabilities from agriculture data are extensively being
    employed in smart farming. Several challenges facing by big data and AI in precision
    agriculture are classified appropriately. Automation and application of AI, drones,
    IoT, robots, and big data are anticipated to perform a significant function in
    various agriculture areas in addition to precision farming. Employment of high-performance
    data-driven scalable learning methods provides better real-time decision-making
    capabilities and automates various agriculture processes, and thus can transform
    conventional farm management into artificial intelligence systems. Emerging domains
    of cutting-edge ML and data mining converged with accessible datasets and strategy
    structures are required to act instrumental in addressing the challenges of agrarian
    production regarding sustainability, efficiency, climate change, and food security.
    A data-driven system benefits every single stakeholder engaged with the agriculture
    business right from agriculture practitioners (farmers) to consumers, financial
    institutions, food processing industries, and several others. Even though the
    best of its capabilities are still unexplored that it has to offer for value generation,
    it has already begun to get enormous revolutions in the agriculture industry.
    Some of the various benefits AI and big data offers include the development of
    healthier and superior products because of the availability of the new plant genome
    sequencing techniques, precision agriculture methods help in inferring conversant
    decision making, and the utilization of IoT sensor devices and analytics techniques
    help in thwarting the food wastage and food-borne diseases. Authors Figures References

    1 Introduction IoT is defined as a system that is built for bigger things rather
    than smartphones and wireless devices, connected by communication infrastructure
    with a range of software and work according to the sensed environment without
    human intervention. Such applications find wide use in Climate Science, Neuroscience,
    Environmental Science, Precision Agriculture, Epidemiology/Health care, Traffic
    Dynamics, Crime data, etc. These applications need sensor networks to collect
    data for the necessary analysis and prediction. IoT (Internet of Things) in smart
    agriculture refers to the use of cameras, sensors, and other devices wherein every
    action has been done corresponds to related data. India’s start-up ecology is
    the 3rd largest technical ecology in the world with 60-65% start-ups where 70%
    of them are not more than 7 yrs old. These startups focus on customers as well
    as agricultural and industrial areas [1] since the Industrial sector contributes
    31% of the Indian GDP while the agriculture sector contributing around 16% of
    the Indian GDP. Smart agriculture is a need of our modern world to grow more food
    with effective use of the land. Based on this idea many countries have started
    the implementation of smart agriculture. Researchers from different parts of the
    world have proposed and published their ideas to solve the traditional farming
    challenges. Since there is a need to evaluate and monitor industrial agricultural
    enterprises, as it is currently a high-tech sector of the economy, precision agriculture
    finds its important place in the Internet of things applications. Smart agriculture
    has been realized with diverse technologies, some of which are computationally
    constrained like wireless sensor networks approach or computationally intensive
    like machine learning models. Internet of Things is the technology that employs
    both sensors as well as for analytics for implementing precision agriculture.
    Current technologies provide common practices done at the farm level with the
    help of geo-referencing or meteorological data. Some of them include electromagnetic
    soil mapping, soil sample collection, and crop yield data collection. Others focus
    on soil types, soil characteristics, drainage level, Arial imagery and crop and
    soil index mapping [2, 3]. With the use of intelligent systems and without the
    requirement of regular human intervention, monitoring the agricultural lands and
    products would create an efficient system. Smart agriculture applications adapt
    to handle monitoring and decision-making remotely through intelligent devices
    like sensors and actuators. The current techniques for precision architecture
    are enumerated as follows: 1. Use of GPS Access to position locating satellite
    enables the farmers to closely monitor their crops against weeds, intruders and
    weather notifications enabling convenience. However, these require expensive and
    bulky equipment to be installed in the fields wherein the monitoring of devices
    becomes an overhead. 2. VRT(Variable Rate Technology) This enables the variable
    application of input. It controls the number of inputs like fertilizers, pesticides
    that farmers apply to a specific location. It allows the soil to recover its lost
    nutrients, maintains soil fertility, prevents soil erosion. The cultivation of
    different crops in a sequenced season is done in this type. Moisture, temperature,
    pH and soil water are important aspects of plant growth. As the demand for food
    increases day by day, we need to increase food production with the efficient use
    of limited resources like freshwater. In this view, IoT can be a game-changer
    because the IoT devices, especially the sensors, can constantly monitor the different
    environmental conditions as well as the soil condition by continuously collecting
    data about them. With the help of these data, IoT can assist an automatic system
    to control irrigation, pest control, etc. in a better direction to grow more and
    quality food [4, 5]. 2 Related Work Wireless sensor-based smart agriculture use
    microcontrollers to monitor the soil moisture with the help of ground- implanted
    sensors. The system sends the data from sensor to the database server through
    the internet and also automatically notifies the users if the moisture level reached
    a certain level. In [6], the author reviewed different use of WSN technology used
    in the aeroponic method of cultivation. The aeroponic system is a new and modern
    plant cultivation technique of agriculture, where plants are cultivated under
    a completely controlled condition in a closed chamber by giving a small amount
    of mist of nutrient solution in place of the soil. In a periodical basis, the
    nutrient mist is ejected through atomization nozzles. They discussed that using
    WSN we can easily detect and diagnosis the fault at an early stage without depending
    upon the laboratory test. It is also mentioned that by using WSN remotely a farmer
    can able to control the aeroponic system. Similarly, IoT-based systems have been
    used to overcome the constraints of bandwidth and power of sensor nodes, by designing
    a state of the art for LoRaWAN [7], where sensor nodes are enabled with the feature
    of low power consumption and long-range communication. They also proposed to learn
    and adopt an algorithm to extend the operational lifetime of the sensor nodes
    as well as the WSN. In this work, each sensor node has the capability to decide
    which data must be sent to the fusion center, for that author proposed a two-step
    decision algorithm. Computational intelligence [8,9,10] is a powerful tool to
    develop an automated decision-making system for precision agriculture. Many researchers
    have been shown the advantages of neural networks in many applications like simultaneously
    handle quality and quantitative information in agro studies, which can be effective
    for handling nonlinear and linear responses. It has been accepted by researchers
    that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based model can be trained based on different
    physical soil information to monitor and predict soil health. Some researchers
    predict the crop product with the help of combining satellite image information,
    electrical conductivity value of soil particles, soil fertility, and elevation.
    However, their proposed system was unable to forecast the spatial variation in
    the yield because the soil fertility and soil conductivity properties are closely
    correlated to yield. Machine learning is one of the most suitable methods for
    solving multi-valued statistical problems and it can also work in unsupervised
    mode with the help of clustering data. Non-linear-based algorithms have also been
    proposed by researchers for yield prediction, but the results obtained are not
    very promising. Also, laboratory methods are very time-consuming and expensive.
    Ongoing progressions in Machine learning have furnished the science and engineering
    community with an adaptable and quick forecast system, demonstrating a huge potential
    effect. Machine learning in agriculture is a set of well-defined models that collects
    specific data and apply specific algorithms and steps for the achievement of best-expected
    results. Machine learning provides more accurate and faster results in analyzing
    cropping patterns, accurate detection and classification of cropping patterns,
    and helps to understand the dynamics of the environment. Different algorithms
    of ML are used to classify cropping patterns like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
    Random forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and other Bayesian
    algorithms. In ANN, data are passed through many different layers, all consist
    of nodes from where the data is passed in a multistep process for pattern recognition.
    Every node of each layer gets trained on different feature sets depending on the
    output of the pre-layer. In random forest algorithm, which is a supervised classification
    algorithm, is used for quantitative analysis in cropping patterns. Contextual
    information of crops is taken and from this approach, it proceeds in pattern recognition
    of crops. 3 Proposed Work Ideally, farmers are already aware of the weather patterns,
    soil temperature, humidity, expected growth, and other factors. However, their
    decisions are purely based on human experience and expertise which may sometimes
    be wrong. It has also been observed that farmers rotate crops to improve diversity
    and monitor irrigation rates so that salts do not accumulate. Other precision
    agriculture practices are applying nutrients, water, seeds, and other agricultural
    inputs to grow more crops in a wide range of soil environments. For this, a large
    number of field data is taken to analyze the performance of crops in various temperatures,
    rainfall, sunlight hours. These characteristics are correlated and finally, a
    probable model is built which decides what crops will most likely contribute with
    following climate and soil factors. For our prediction algorithm, we employ Naive
    Bayes and SVM algorithm approaches for feature extraction and classification purposes.
    These machine learning techniques are implemented and tested finally, and a comparative
    analysis is recorded for optimal cropping. For the collection of the requisite
    data, we have used GIS datasets from GIOVANNI websites. 3.1 Naive Bayes [11] Application
    areas of naive Bayes in agriculture are crop classification, site-specific crop
    management, cattle management, early crop yield estimation, disease detection
    in leaves, weed detection and vegetation classification. These are probabilistic
    classifiers. A dynamic self-reliance assumption among different features is made.
    This approach is to ascertain the particular crop of data transmitted by the sensor.
    Classifiers can be trained in an effective manner in supervised learning which
    very efficient in complex real-world situations. A small amount of trained data
    is only required for the estimation of parameters which is important for classification
    purposes. 3.2 Naive Bayes [11] SVM is a risk minimization algorithm based on learning.
    It is an effective method for agricultural data classification. SVMs can reduce
    redundant information and sensors only collects data that further need to be classified
    on extracting the feature from the collected data. It is a binary classifier that
    constructs a linear separating hyper plane for the classification of instances
    of data. They have been used for clustering, regression, and classification. SVMs
    are used for feature extraction, predicting yield and also for estimating crop
    quality. We use the Kernel trick for transforming the data and then extracting
    the desired features. Our algorithm outputs an optimal hyper plane that categorizes
    new features. The original input data are mapped into dimensional feature space
    to get a separated hyper plane, following which classification is done with the
    help of N-dimensional hyper plane constructed. Experiments on real agricultural
    datasets have been performed as depicted in Fig. 1 where post-extraction to features
    of crops, naive Bayes algorithm predicts the probable crop. Fig. 1 Block diagram
    for crop prediction Full size image Here naive Bayes [11] classifier is used,
    this method is for representing knowledge and beliefs using probabilities. The
    main objective of using a naive Bayes is to calculate the conditional probability
    of an object with a feature vector X1,X2, …, Xn and belongs to particular class
    Ci according to the relation P(Ci/X1,X2…Xn) = {P(X1, X2, … Xn/Ci). P(Ci)}/P (X1,
    X2, … Xn); $$ {\\text{For 1}} \\Leftarrow {\\text{i}} \\Leftarrow {\\text{ k}}
    $$ (1) Probabilistic model Algorithm 1. Assume conditional probability (Pi) of
    a crop with n feature vectors 2. Assume N feature vectors where N = {X1, X2, X3,
    … Xn} and n ∈ N 3. Assume ‘i’ classes that each crop belongs from a set of classes
    {C1, C2, …, Cn} 4. The Naive Bayes classifier predicts Crop ‘X’ to belong to ‘C’
    with a class efficiency given by $$ {\\text{P}}\\left( {{\\text{C}}/{\\text{X}}}
    \\right) \\, = {\\text{ P}}\\left( {{\\text{X1}}/{\\text{C}}} \\right) \\, *{\\text{

    {{\\text{Xn}}/{\\text{C}}} \\right) \\, *{\\text{P}}\\left( {\\text{C}} \\right)
    $$ SVM (support vector machine is a classifier that is constructed for linear
    separating hyperplane or a decision boundary to classify instances of data. The
    nature of the hyperplane is that it should be equidistant from both the side negative
    and positive sides of the decision boundary. Step 1: Hyperplane can be expressed
    as $$ {\\text{W}}0 \\, + {\\text{ WT }}*{\\text{Xpositive}} = { 1} $$ (2a) or
    $$ {\\text{W}}0 \\, + {\\text{ WT }}*{\\text{Xnegative}} = \\, - 1 $$ (2b) Step
    2: Subtraction of eq. 2a and 2b gives $$ {\\text{WT }}\\left( {{\\text{Xpositive
    }} - {\\text{ Xnegative}}} \\right) \\, = { 2} $$ (3) Step 3: On Normalizing this
    by vector W $$ {\\text{W}} = \\, \\sum {\\text{mj}} = 1 {\\text{Wj}}_{ 2} $$ (4)
    Step 4: Compute result: $$ \\left\\{ {{\\text{WT}}\\left( {{\\text{Xpositive}}
    - {\\text{Xnegative}}} \\right)} \\right\\}/\\left\\| {\\text{W}} \\right\\| =
    { 2}/\\left\\| {\\text{W}} \\right\\| $$ (5) The optimization function requires
    maximizing (2/║W║) with the constraint of the given samples being extracted properly.
    We assume’X’ features wherein X = {soil type, rainfall, temperature, pH, sunlight,
    class} are vectors. The ‘Class’ decides which type of crop is best to be grown
    with the given vectors. There are ‘i’ classes given as (C = C1, C2,…, Ci). The
    Classes that we have considered for our analysis are rice, wheat, cotton, oilseeds,
    sugarcane. ‘C’ is considered as the evidence of belonging to a class here, hence
    the probability of evidence of a selected crop is ‘P(C)’. The vectors are the
    deciding factors on which class will depend, and their probabilities are assumed
    as P(X), that is, prior probability of evidence. Therefore, P(C/X) is called posterior
    i.e. occurrence of the particular crop when the given vector is true. P(X/C) is
    called likelihood, that is, probability of observing all the vectors with given
    parameters. Where P(C) = probability of evidence P(X) = prior probability of evidence
    P(C/X) = posterior P(X/C) = likelihood Our algorithm Posterior as Posterior = {(Likelihood)
    * (Probability evidence)}/Prior Probability of evidence. We have assumed the parameters
    of temperature in degree Celsius, rainfall in cm, sunlight in hours as provided
    by the datasets. The data is first to split into train and test phases and then
    by applying Naive Bayes as a classifier for prediction. The prediction of the
    test data through applying the Naive Bayes classifier in our model gives an accuracy
    of 96.00% and applying Support Vector Machine (rbf kernel) gives the prediction
    with 76% accuracy. In this experiment, a confusion matrix has been used for getting
    the result. Figure 2 depicts the visualization of the performance of algorithms
    adopted. The X-axis represents the true label while the Y-axis is the predicted
    label. This shows performance measurement for machine learning classification.
    The number of correct and incorrect values of fertilizers to be applied to the
    soil for the cultivation of crops as specified in the dataset tells about the
    predicted result and incorrect values tell about errors faced during prediction.
    Fig. 2 a heatmap of SVM, b heatmap of Naive Bayes Full size image From Fig. 2
    we can see that the naïve Bayes heat map has a value 7 with dark color which shows
    this has a more accurate result than SVM as SVM has value 5 which is dark in color
    and value 0 show that these points are far away from prediction point. Thus, we
    can infer that Naive Bayes is better in classifying the dataset than SVM. As Naive
    Bayes gets more accuracy and this classifier depends on probabilistic features
    so this classifier can be used for better crop prediction, and farmers can use
    this in the agricultural field for their crop prediction system to get better
    productivity. 4 Conclusion Precision agriculture or site-specific agriculture
    adopts many modern farming practices to increase the productivity of the available
    land. With smart agriculture, the misapplication of products is greatly reduced
    with an improvement in crop and farm efficiency. With our proposed algorithm,
    the prediction of crops that would effectively grow in the given set of soil characteristics
    and minerals has been presented. Results show that the prediction of fertilizer
    with different classifiers calculating accuracy and heatmap. These results can
    be used to estimate the amount of fertilizer or minerals that can be provided
    to the soil for the desired crop which is the future extension of our work. References

  description: Climate change, with increasing temperatures and atmospheric carbon
    dioxide levels, constitutes a severe threat to the environment and all living
    organisms. In particular, numerous studies suggest severe consequences for the
    health of crop plants, affecting both the productivity and quality of raw material

    agriculture Agriculture and global climate change During the last centuries, significant
    changes in the global climate and temperatures have been registered. Since industrial
    revolution, massive burning of fossil fuels started and progressively led to an
    increase of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon
    dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrogen dioxide affecting global temperatures. Due
    to its strong dependence on climate, agriculture is an easy target of climate
    change. The increase of temperature is responsible for abiotic stresses that drastically
    affect crop quality, resulting in dramatic yield losses. Such stresses can interfere
    with germination, vegetative growth, dry matter partitioning, reproductive processes
    and grain filling and quality (Sehgal et al. 2018). In particular, the frequent
    combination of drought and heat stresses has pronounced impacts during early phases
    of the reproductive process (sporogenesis, anthesis, pollination, fertilization
    and early embryo development). Global warming also increases frequency and severity
    of plant pests and diseases with consequent loss of yield and quality (Trębicki
    et al. 2015). In theory, an increase in primary production is expected at elevated
    CO2 (eCO2) levels but experiments show that long term exposure to eCO2 increases
    or decreases photosynthetic efficiency depending on the species (Ghildiyal and
    Sharma-Natu 2000; Sánchez-Guerrero et al. 2005; Ziska and Bunce 2007). Moreover,
    CO2 beneficial effects on plant growth appear to be limited by low nutrients concentration
    in soils, light and water availability (Reich et al. 2016). All these concomitant
    factors can affect not only crop yields but also food quality. On the other hand,
    current intensive agricultural practices, including land clearing, excessive and
    inefficient use of fertilizers, irrigation and the use of fossil fuels for agricultural
    machines, make agriculture a significant contributor to GHG emissions (Heidecke
    et al. 2018). Therefore, as summarized in Figure 1, modern agriculture has two
    great challenges: facing climate change effects (adaptation) and developing sustainable
    practices, counteracting also the negative effects on yields and food quality
    (mitigation). This goal may be reached with a more efficient and respectful use
    of natural resources and a reduction of wastes and pollutants. Climate-Smart Agriculture
    (CSA) is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient
    agricultural systems to effectively support development and ensure food security
    in a changing climate (FAO 2017). It includes traditional organic farming techniques
    as well as innovative precision farming practices which apply Information Technology
    (IT) aiming to optimize the use of water and fertilizers. In this review we summarize
    the effects of climate change and the different CSA practices, highlighting their
    potential positive effects on food safety and healthy proprieties. Figure 1. Different
    sustainable agronomic practices and their possible effects on climate change mitigation
    and quality and safety of food products. CSA = Climate Smart Agriculture. Display
    full size Climate change effects on food quality Food quality is a concept that
    includes healthy properties and safety. Healthy properties are determined by the
    content of beneficial nutritional compounds as micronutrients, especially Fe and
    Zn, antioxidants or bioactive molecules such as carotenoids, tocopherols and phenolic
    compounds. Safety is determined by the absence of toxic compounds derived both
    from herbicides and pesticides and/or toxic metabolites derived from pest attack.
    Food safety Mycotoxins are a great threat to food safety: they are low molecular
    weight toxic and cancerogenic compounds produced by fungi Aspergillus, Fusarium
    and Penicillium which infect mostly cereals, a staple food for many people and
    thus their impact on global health risks is not negligible. Aflatoxins, the most
    common mycotoxins, are furanocoumarin derivatives produced by Aspergillus flavus
    and A. parasiticus: AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2 are the most toxic molecules (Zain
    2011). They are potent carcinogens and sometimes cause acute and lethal intoxication.
    Moreover, AFB1 is toxic for lactating animals and may be converted by their digestive
    system in the hydroxylated form, AFM1 which is excreted in milk (Applebaum et
    al. 1982). European Community has set restrictive limits for the combined presence
    of the above-mentioned aflatoxins in feed and food (Commission Regulation (EC)
    N. 1881/2006 2006). The infection of maize crop by A. flavus is highly facilitated
    by warm climate, humidity and drought. Following some predictive models, an increase
    of +5 °C can shift the European area of possible aflatoxin production in maize,
    from the actual below the 45° North latitude to 60° North. This means that the
    area with high aflatoxin risks will be considerably extended in Eastern Europe,
    the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean regions (Battilani et al. 2016). These
    effects seem less dramatic for wheat: even if the models predict an increase of
    A. flavus growth by 60% and 100% in the + 2 °C and + 5 °C scenarios, the probability
    of aflatoxin contamination in wheat is considered irrelevant. An integrated model
    was elaborated to predict the effect of global climatic change on the risk of
    aflatoxin contamination in cow milk, carrying out a study on AFB1 production in
    maize grown in Eastern Europe and imported to the Netherlands for feeding livestock
    (Van der Fels-Klerx et al. 2019). In general, most of the calculations suggest
    an increase, up to 50%, of maximum mean aflatoxin AFM1 in milk and a stable or
    slight increase (up to 0.6%) of probability to find AFM1 in milk above the EC
    limits by 2030. However, the authors highlighted that the results depend on the
    type of model used. The aflatoxins constitute a threat also for grape and wine
    production. A survey of 942 samples showed higher concentrations of grape aflatoxin
    ochratoxin A in wines from the warmer southern European countries than from northern
    ones (de Orduña 2010). Moreover, a correlation between grape and wine ochratoxin
    A levels and the warm climate was described (Blesa et al. 2006). Food nutritional
    and organoleptic properties An extensive meta-analysis (Loladze 2014) considering
    130 food plant varieties over 30 years around the world evidenced a general decline
    due to eCO2 of the principal nutrients (N, P, Ca, S, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu) except for
    Mn and K. N is the most affected element (about −15%), followed by Zn (−11%) and
    Fe (−10%). Cereal grains (barley, rice and wheat) showed an overall decrease of
    above nutrients (around −7%), while potato tubers seem less affected (−3.5%).
    The overall nutrient reduction in all edible tissues is around −6.5%. In contrast
    to the lower N and mineral content, eCO2 increased C content by 6%, with a significant
    increase of total nonstructural carbohydrate, like starch, fructose, glucose,
    sucrose and maltose. In wheat, the world’s third most important cereal crop, the
    eCO2 reduces N, proteins, and amino acids and modifies gluten composition (Broberg,
    Högy, and Pleijel 2017). This negatively affects bakery properties reducing dough
    elasticity and strength, bread volume and increasing mixing time. Also a significant
    reduction of the concentration of various minerals (Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, P,
    S, and Zn) was observed, while no effect was reported on starch accumulation (Broberg,
    Högy, and Pleijel 2017). Also rice, a staple food for a large part of the world
    population, especially in Eastern Countries, is highly affected by climate change.
    High temperatures during grain filling increase the breakage of kernels with a
    dramatic reduction of yields, up to 10% in South-East Asian countries (Lyman et
    al. 2013). eCO2 accelerates the grain filling at an early stage, but inhibits
    it at later one leading to small, light and chalky grains (Tsukaguchi and Iida
    2008; Yang and Wang 2019). Moreover, under eCO2 rice proteins decrease but the
    percentage of large starch granules increases; this generates voids among the
    granules that increase chalkiness (Yang et al. 2007). On the other hand, eCO2
    does not seem to affect the amylose content in the starch, the key factor in determining
    the organoleptic quality of cooked rice, as well as aroma, taste and overall palatability
    (Yang and Wang 2019). Under eCO2 vitamin B concentration in grains declines, probably
    as a consequence of reduced N assimilation, but that of vitamin E increases (Zhu
    et al. 2018). The reduction of proteins and micronutrients content and increasing
    of sugars under eCO2 have been observed also in potato, tomato and lettuce (Bhat,
    Ahsan, and Husain 2017; Dong et al. 2018). In potato tubers, eCO2 increases the
    concentration of glucose (22%), fructose (21%) and reducing sugars (23%), responsible
    for browning and acrylamide formation in fried potatoes (Högy and Fangmeier 2009).
    eCO2 decreases also the content of Zn, citrate and glycoalkaloids. The reduction
    of citrate concentration leads to a higher risk of discoloration but improves
    the taste. Glycoalkaloids are toxic compounds, therefore their reduction may be
    positive in terms of safety, but is generally considered negative in term of taste.
    However, the data about glycoalkaloids and citrate are not concordant among all
    authors. In tomato and lettuce, the increase of soluble sugars potentially enhances
    their quality, as well as the antioxidant ascorbic acid but, the concomitant reduction
    of proteins content worsens their nutritional properties (Dong et al. 2018). The
    effect of eCO2 on phytate concentration in wheat, rice, peas, soybeans and in
    C4 maize and sorghum was also evaluated (Myers et al. 2014). Phytate is a phosphate
    storage molecule present in many plants, that is not absorbed by the human digestive
    tract and inhibits the absorption of Zn and therefore is considered an anti-nutrient
    (Miller, Krebs, and Hambidge 2007). Phytate decreased significantly at eCO2 only
    in wheat, but not sufficiently to counteract the strong decrease of Zn in the
    same crop. A more recent study showed that eCO2 affects proteins and micronutrients
    content of seeds and fruits in most C3 plant species with the exception of legumes
    that absorb atmospheric N through symbiotic bacteria (Uddling et al. 2018). However,
    the magnitude of the effect is influenced by different factors like cultivar,
    soil type or concomitant environmental conditions (Dong et al. 2018). As far as
    carbohydrates content is concerned, high temperature has a larger effect than
    eCO2 (Bhat, Ahsan, and Husain 2017). In soybean seeds, an increase from 18°/13 °C
    to 33/28 °C (day/night average) significantly raises sucrose concentration. In
    wheat, an increase of 2–4 °C alters starch content, starch grain size, number
    and gelatinization, while eCO2 has no or little effect (Williams et al. 1995).
    Studies on combined effects of high temperature and CO2 on red kidney bean seeds
    showed that their composition was unaffected by eCO2 but high temperature (34/24 °C)
    dramatically reduced glucose concentration (−44%) and increased the concentration
    of sucrose (33%) and raffinose (116%) (Thomas et al. 2009). The increase in raffinose
    harms seed quality because human intestinal mucosa does not contain the galactosidase
    enzyme necessary for its digestion and this may cause digestive problems (Sebastian
    et al. 2000). High temperature lowers malic acid concentration and the overall
    acidity of grape at maturity and increases the sugar concentration, probably as
    a consequence of berry evaporation (de Orduña 2010). Lower acidity negatively
    affects winemaking because of flavors spoilage by indigenous microorganisms that
    compete also with fermenting yeasts for nutrients. This may slow down or stuck
    alcoholic fermentation and lead to the production of undesirable metabolites like
    acetic acid, acetaldehyde and pyruvate (de Orduña 2010). High temperature favors
    the synthesis of metoxypyrazines that are agreeable at low concentrations but
    are perceived negatively at high concentrations, with a negative impact on grape
    aroma and taste. The beneficial effects of higher temperatures are mainly the
    increase of flavonoids and antioxidants in strawberry fruits (Bhat, Ahsan, and
    Husain 2017; Wang and Zheng 2001). Most of the data present in the literature
    report the effects of temperature and CO2 separately, but their effect is the
    results of complex interactions between them and other environmental factors,
    therefore, it is important to evaluate at least CO2 and temperature together.
    The response to dual CO2 and temperature stress is crop-specific: stressed soybean
    plants produce seeds with a higher content of proteins but lower oil content (Dornbos
    and Mullen 1992). In cereals such as barley and wheat combined stresses reduce
    starch accumulation but increase protein content, while in Brassica species seed
    proteins content increases but seed weight is reduced (Savin and Nicolas 1996;
    Gan et al. 2004). Köhler et al. ( 2019) observed that high temperatures reduce
    yields of soybean plants but increase the concentration of some minerals (Ca,
    Fe, Zn) in seeds, counteracting the overall negative effects of eCO2. Differently
    of what observed in other crops, eCO2 does not affect the concentration of seed
    proteins and oil while, in contrast, elevated temperatures tend to reduce the
    concentration of these components. The authors concluded that the combined eCO2
    and temperature effect may restore the seed Fe and Zn at normal levels but their
    experiments are limited to one cultivar and concentration of minerals and proteins
    varies with node position. A predictive model evaluated climate change impact
    on wheat proteins considering the effects of CO2, water, nitrogen and temperature
    (Asseng et al. 2019). The authors concluded that potential benefits of eCO2 can
    be outcompeted by rising temperatures and changes in rainfall pattern, with significant
    differences among regions. In fact, grain and protein yields are expected to be
    lower and more variable in low rainfall regions, where nitrogen availability can
    affect the growth stimulus of eCO2. Climate smart agriculture The concept of CSA
    has been introduced by FAO at the 2010 Hague Conference on Agriculture, Food Security
    and Climate Change and since then has gained international interest and support
    (FAO 2017). The main objectives of CSA are: (i) the sustainable increase of agricultural
    productivity; (ii) the adaptation to climate change and the increase of resilience
    in the agricultural sector; (iii) reducing GHG emissions (when possible) and contributing
    to the mitigation of climate change effects (Beddington et al. 2012). For these
    strategies to be successful they have to be adapted to the local situation as
    there is no universally valid solution. At the same time, however, national and
    international plans will be necessary and the whole value chain, from the field
    to the consumer, should be considered. The massive use of chemical fertilizers
    and pesticides is considered a threat to health, soils and ecosystem biodiversity.
    Nitrogen fertilization is essential for obtaining high crop yields but a surplus
    of this nutrient can cause serious problems for the environment and human health.
    If not uptaken by plants, N can leach through the soil as nitrate (NO3-) and pollute
    surface and groundwater. This excess of nutrients leads to planktonic algae proliferation
    in rivers, lakes and estuaries, a phenomenon known as eutrophication (Entry and
    Sojka 2007; Liu et al. 2013; Riley, Ortiz-Monasterio, and Matson 2001; Smith and
    Schindler 2009). According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in the US less
    than 50% of the total N fertilizer applied is actually up-taken by crops so a
    more site-specific application, tailored to crop needs, has a great potential
    to mitigate environmental risks (http://www.epa.gov/ncea/efh/report.html). The
    situation is not any better in Europe, where the estimated indirect costs of nitrogen
    pollution on human health and ecosystems outweigh the direct benefits of agriculture
    (Brownlie et al. 2015). CSA promotes the use of organic alternatives of fertilization
    and pesticide and/or fertilization use targeted on the real needs of cultivation
    avoiding unnecessary and polluting applications, which can also have a positive
    impact on climate change and may also be beneficial to food quality. Organic farming
    Organic farming consists of a low-input agro-ecosystem in which crop productivity
    is based on the natural availability of plant nutrients, the use of green manure
    and biological pathogen control. These practices are regulated by international
    and national institutional bodies that certify organic products in all steps of
    the supply chain (European Commission 2016; USDA (United States Department of
    Agriculture) 2016). Organic farming practices are surely safer for the environment
    but some studies revealed that organic farming reduces on average the crop yields
    (Gomiero 2018). This implies that to obtain the same quantity of product as with
    conventional agriculture it is necessary to extend the cultivable land and to
    disrupt forestry and other natural habitats. Besides, organic farming employs
    animal manure instead of inorganic easy soluble fertilizers but, this does not
    necessarily imply less N leaching or less eutrophication (Kirchmann and Thorvaldsson
    2000). Seufert, Ramankutty, and Foley ( 2012) used a comprehensive meta-analysis
    to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming.
    They examined 66 studies representing 62 sites and reporting 316 organic-to-conventional
    yield comparisons on 34 different crop species. The results showed that, overall,
    organic yields are typically lower than conventional ones: these differences ranged
    from 5% to 34% depending on system, crop and site characteristics. However, organic
    farming may be highly competitive under stress conditions: for example, under
    drought stress organically managed crops produce higher yields than those conventionally
    managed, up to 70–90% more under severe stress, thanks to the better ability of
    organically managed soil to store water (Gomiero 2013; Gomiero 2018). Data on
    soil biodiversity in organic and conventional farming are rather controversial:
    some authors (Hartmann et al. 2015) found that organic farming increases the diversity
    of the microbiome, while others (Liu et al. 2007; Reilly et al. 2013) reported
    no differences or less diversity than in conventional farming. Lupatini et al.
    ( 2017) compared microbiomes around several crops (wheat, barley, potato, carrot
    and lily) in organic and conventional farming on the same soil. This study revealed
    that organic practices effectively increase microbial diversity, richness and
    community heterogeneity. However, the authors conclude that the response of the
    microbial community to farming practices is diverse and complex and increasing
    soil biodiversity does not necessarily mean an improvement of soil health and
    plant productivity (Lupatini et al. 2017). Moreover, the impact of diversity loss
    in conventional farming and how microbial diversity is related to ecosystem functions
    is not very well understood yet. Also, the long-term consequences of the microbial
    community enrichment in organic practices shift remain to be explored. Biofertilizers
    and nano-fertilizers The use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has
    been investigated as an alternative to conventional N and P fertilizers to obtain
    high yields with lower environmental impacts. Rhizobacteria are microorganisms
    naturally living in soils in association with plant roots, forming an active part
    of the so-called rhizosphere. Their activities include stimulation and/or production
    of phytohormones and the regulation of nutrients uptake so, inoculating these
    organisms in the cultivated field should enhance plant and soil productivity,
    especially under stress condition (Egamberdieva and Adesemoye 2016). In addition
    to PGPR, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi are nonpathogenic microorganisms
    that are able to establish symbioses with many spontaneous and cultivated species,
    and have the ability to boost water and nutrient uptake, especially in poor, arid
    soils, and to protect plants against pathogens (Fiorilli et al. 2018). A two-year
    field trial demonstrated that the use of a combination of PGPR and N-fixing bacteria
    improves root growth in wheat and increases plant resilience to environmental
    stresses. In addition, they help to reduce N losses from agricultural ecosystems
    thereby mitigating environmental constraints of the application of chemical fertilizers
    (Dal Cortivo et al. 2017). Application of PGPR and VAM consortia has also been
    shown to improve plant growth, in particular in conditions of abiotic stress,
    as a result of synergistic interactions between microorganisms. However, despite
    good results in the laboratory (Bhattacharyya and Jha 2012), inoculation of PGPR
    and VAM in the field does not always lead to the expected benefits because of
    the competition with native species and adverse or unstable conditions (Bréant,
    Jézéquel, and Lebeau 2002). A new emerging technology in agriculture is the design
    and use of nano-carriers for the controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides
    to increase their efficacy and reduce their toxicity and the environmental impact.
    The nanoscale delivery vehicles are designed to “anchor” to plant roots or the
    surrounding soil structures increasing the surface contact between plant roots
    and fertilizers (Chen and Yada 2011; Chen, Seiber, and Hotze 2014; He, Deng, and
    Hwang 2019). Nano-carriers have been utilized to encapsulated the 2,4-dichlorophenoxy
    acetic acid (2,4-D) which is one of the most commonly used herbicides worldwide
    because it is cheap and selective but very soluble in water and therefore easily
    dispersed in the soil (Cao et al. 2018). The fungicide carbendazim entrapped into
    polymeric nanoparticles showed higher activity against Aspergillus parasiticus
    and Fusarium oxysporum than pure and commercial preparation and was less phytotoxic
    (Kumar, Kumar, and Dilbaghi 2017). However, the majority of nanofertilizers have
    been tested only in laboratories, greenhouses, or small plots without facing the
    field complexity, thus, it is difficult to draw a conclusion at this point (Liu
    and Lal 2015; Dimkpa and Bindraban 2018). Soil characteristics such as pH, inorganic
    or organic compounds and biological factors (plant root exudates, bacteria and
    fungi) influence micronutrients behavior and modulate nanomaterial dissolution,
    aggregation/disaggregation and surface properties. Dimkpa and Bindraban ( 2018)
    summarized the results obtained mostly about Zn nanomaterial since it is a relevant
    element in human nutrition and concluded that the effects on crops are often positive
    with respect to conventional micronutrients but negative at doses higher than
    plant requirements. These authors concluded that the risks from nanoparticles
    under field conditions could be either less or as strong as those from conventional
    fertilizers at similar dose. An important issue of nano-carriers used as fertilizers
    or pesticides is their possible toxicological profiles which can be new potential
    hazards to human and environmental health. Nano-agrochemicals may interfere with
    important plant-microbial relationships which are all critical for soil fertility
    and agricultural productivity. In addition, human exposure to nanomaterials is
    expected to increase including both chronical exposure of agricultural workers
    and increase in nano-residues in soil and crops which leads to their accumulation
    in the food chain (Iavicoli et al. 2017; Walker et al. 2018). Precision agriculture
    Precision agriculture (PA) is a relatively new frontier in agriculture applied
    for nutrient management (nitrogen and phosphorous), herbicides and pesticides
    modulated on the basis of the real needs of plants thanks to the application of
    information technology to the production system, which makes possible to address
    intra-field variability with potential economic and environmental benefits (Bongiovanni
    and Lowenberg-Deboer 2004). PA started to develop in USA, Canada, Australia and
    Western Europe in the 1980s and has gained importance in the last decade (Zhang,
    Wang, and Wang 2002). Variable-rate application (VRA) is the most spread and investigated
    precision technology to increase fertilizer inputs efficiency. It is used in combination
    with other technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Geographic Information
    Systems (GIS), soil sampling and integrated pest management and can be applied
    to seeding, weed and pests control, lime distribution and fertilizers application
    (Pallottino et al. 2018). There are two VRA technologies: Map-based VRA and Sensor-based
    VRA. In the first one, the input concentration is regulated thanks to the use
    of so-called prescription maps previously prepared and downloaded on a specific
    software on the applicator connected to a GPS device. In the second case, optical
    sensors on the applicator measure the targeted property in real-time. There is,
    however, an effort to integrate remote sensing and real-time data in order to
    develop an accessible database for site-specific fertilization. Research is progressing
    through an integrated approach as new studies are combining sensors, prediction
    models and real-time weather data to maximize yields and inputs efficiency. Nitrogen
    VRA has the highest potential, but it is still the most controversial part of
    PA techniques, due to the complexity of the N cycle, highly impacted by wheatear,
    soil type, agricultural management and the great field variability (Rogovska et
    al. 2019). Climate smart agriculture and food quality Organic farming is the most
    ancient practice of CSA and the majority of studies are focused on differences
    between organic and conventional products and therefore this chapter will be mainly
    focused on this subject. Recent data are available also about the food quality
    of other CSA practices, and some indications about food quality are available
    about PA practices and biofertilizers utilization. Traceability is also an important
    parameter to guarantee food quality and therefore PA issues will be discussed
    also on this point of view. Climate smart agriculture and food safety The main
    concern for the environment and human health is the utilization of pesticides
    and their presence in foods, that may be responsible or contribute to the development
    of cancer, Parkinson’s disease and endocrine disorders (Gomiero 2013; Johansson
    et al. 2014). European Food Safety Authority (ESFA) analyzed the residual presence
    of 191 pesticides in 82,649 samples produced in the EU (EFSA (European Food Safety
    Authority) 2016). Organic food showed a higher percentage (86.4%) of samples without
    any quantifiable pesticide residual than conventional ones (51.6%). The percentages
    of samples above the Maximum Residue Levels permitted by EU legislation were lower
    in organic products (1.2%) than in conventional ones (3%). However, being these
    percentages so low, EFSA concluded that the general level of pesticide residues
    in both conventional and organic food is well below the threshold risk for health.
    The differences are particularly evident in fruits and nuts, where 69.4% of conventional
    products contained residues, against only 9.6% of organic products. Possible contamination
    occurring in fields or during food processing can explain the presence of pesticide
    residuals, not allowed in organic agriculture, in organic food. Conventional food
    is richer in toxic residuals of organophosphates (OPs) (EFSA (European Food Safety
    Authority) 2016) classified as carcinogenic, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors
    by World Health Organization. An extensive study recently conducted on 33,000
    French adult volunteers showed significantly lower urinary levels of residual
    pesticides diethylthiophosphate, dimethylthiophosphate, dialkylphosphates, and
    free 3-phenoxybenzoic in organic food consumers than in conventional food consumers
    (Baudry et al. 2019). Moreover, exposure to certain OPs and pyrethroïd pesticides
    is reduced by switching from conventional to organic foods, especially fruits
    and vegetables, while no significant differences were found for other compounds.
    The authors pointed out that the study may be biased by the honesty of volunteers
    in answering about their eating habits and/or other possible sources of contamination
    of OPs than food. However, these results were confirmed by Hyland et al. ( 2019)
    that observed significant reductions in urinary levels of thirteen pesticide metabolites
    and related compounds (OPs, neonicotinoid, and pyrethroid insecticides and the
    herbicide 2,4-D) after the introduction of organic food in the diet, in children
    and adults of USA families differing for race and geographic origin. Literature
    about heavy metals is quite contradictory: some authors did not found a significant
    difference in their contents between organic and conventional food (Magkos, Arvaniti,
    and Zampelas 2006), others found higher levels of Cd and Pb in organic tomatoes
    (Rossi et al. 2008). Lower levels of Cd were found in organic cereals, while no
    differences were found in fruits (Barański et al. 2014). The higher content of
    Cd in conventional products may be related to the use of phosphate fertilizers
    that are often contaminated with this metal, or to its native concentration in
    the soil. High concentrations of Cd are considered a significant cause of vascular
    disorders, various common cancers, osteoporosis and other health disorders, therefore,
    the lower Cd levels in organic food are certainly a positive fact (McCarty and
    Nicolantonio 2014). As reported previously, mycotoxin contamination constitutes
    a serious concern for food, especially for those derived from cereals. Because
    synthetic fungicides were banned in organic agriculture, it has been argued that
    organic crops may be more susceptible to fungal contamination. In fact, higher
    concentrations of mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and nivalenol were found in organic
    than in conventional grain samples (Eltun 1997). Moreover, an extensive comparison
    of more than a thousand organic and conventional cereal-based products from EU
    countries found a higher content of fumonisins (Fusarium derived mycotoxins) in
    organic products (Rubert et al. 2013). However, no statistical analysis was provided
    and it was not stated if differences were significant or not. Moreover, organic
    and conventional food types analyzed were not the same in the various studies
    and it can have introduced some bias in the analysis. A similar work carried out
    in the USA on 50 conventional and 50 organic foods, did not show a significant
    difference in mycotoxin content (Gourama 2015). In general, the majority of the
    studies does not report significant differences in mycotoxin content in organic
    and conventional food (Gomiero 2018) but the discordant results should be taken
    into consideration before concluding that organic is absolutely safe. Climate
    smart agriculture and food technological quality and nutritional proprieties It
    was previously documented that eCO2 has negative impacts on food quality such
    as reduction of proteins and micronutrients, especially Zn and Fe, and increase
    of sugars content. It is not easy to say if organic farming and other CSA practices
    are able to counteract these food deficiencies since studies conducted so far,
    in particular the comparisons between organic and conventional food, were done
    on sites differing not only for agricultural practices but also for different
    type of soil, crop genotypes and time and conditions of harvesting. However, despite
    these limitations, more positive than negative trends can be resumed by literature
    data. In particular, as far as technological quality is concerned, PA techniques
    gives the possibility to differentiate the quality of raw materials in the field.
    As an example, cereal quality is becoming more important than yield especially
    as the price of cereals reduces on world markets. There is well-substantiated
    evidence that quality, as well as yields, is spatially variable within fields
    and systems are being developed to exploit such variation to add value to the
    harvested crop (Stafford 2013). Recent advances in PA offer new potential for
    meeting grain quality standards. In particular, nitrogen-VRA could play a pivotal
    role in driving quality-oriented fertilization and on the other hand, precision
    harvesting could be an alternative method to maximize the tonnage of higher quality.
    Recently in Northern Italy, field spatial distribution of yield and protein content
    of durum wheat was assessed through the application of VR fertilization in three
    management zones with increasing soil fertility (Morari et al. 2018). In addition,
    prescription maps and optical sensors drove the precision harvesting of grains
    with different protein contents allowing the production of semolina with higher
    or lower protein contents in order to produce pasta with different characteristics
    (Visioli et al. 2018). Regarding nutritional proprieties, the literature about
    Zn and Fe content in organic and conventional food is very contradictory: some
    studies showed a higher content of Fe and Zn in the organic crops (Vrček et al.
    2014), others in the conventional ones (Ciołek et al. 2012; Drakou et al. 2015;
    Kristl et al. 2013). A meta-analysis study reported a major content of Ca, Mg,
    K and P in organic food but the authors concluded that only the data about P can
    be considered statistically significant (Smith-Spangler et al. 2012). The same
    study showed that protein content is lower in organic fruits and vegetables, as
    well as fiber content, even though the results were not considered significant.
    On the contrary, a 21 years-long survey of organic and conventional grain, concludes
    that protein content and amino acid composition are not affected by farming practice
    (Mäder et al. 2007). Few data are available on sugar content in organic products.
    Studies on wheat reported that sucrose concentration was higher in conventional
    than in organic ears, but this difference was nullified in mature grains. No differences
    were found for other sugars (Zörb et al. 2009). Since the 90’s some studies evidenced
    how organic plant food possesses higher amounts of secondary metabolites, and
    therefore they may be more health-promoting than conventional foods (Brandt and
    Mølgaard 2001; Johansson et al. 2014; Woese et al. 1997). In particular, phenolic
    compound content seems highly influenced by farming practices. Compared to conventional
    farming, higher levels of phenols and polyphenols were found in organic cabbage,
    spinach, Welsh onion, green pepper, organics corn and strawberry (Asami et al.
    2003; Ren et al. 2001). Moreover, an extensive meta-analysis study indicated that
    a switch from conventional to organic crop consumption would result in a 20–40%
    (and for some compounds more than 60%) increase in crop-based antioxidant/(poly)phenolic
    intake (Barański et al. 2014). Tocopherol is another class of antioxidants. Three
    studies conducted with comparative experiments evidenced higher contents of tocochromanol
    in organic barley (Tsochatzis, Bladenopoulos, and Papageorgiou 2012), higher content
    of ɑ- and γ-tocopherols in organic plums (Lombardi-Boccia et al. 2004) and higher
    ɑ-tocopherol content in organic pears (Carbonaro et al. 2002), but in general,
    most investigations showed no difference in the content of tocopherols between
    organic and conventional crops. The same conclusions were drawn for carotenoid
    content (Johansson et al. 2014). Biofertilizers seem to have a positive effect
    on the content of macro and micronutrients, vitamins and antioxidants (Alori and
    Babalola 2018). The application of VAM-PGPR commercial biofertilizer to wheat
    seeds improved the uptake of low-mobility nutrients from roots in wheat plants,
    with quality benefits of the grains (Dal Cortivo et al. 2018; Dal Cortivo et al.
    2020). The beneficial effect of some fungi and bacteria strains endures also during
    post-harvest phases (Rillig et al. 2018). In particular, VAM has been used to
    enhance the plant growth and yield of medicinal crops because they are able to
    stimulate the secondary metabolism of plants to produce compounds with health
    properties, like antioxidants, phenylpropanoid, or carotenoid pathways (Baslam,
    Garmendia, and Goicoechea 2011). Resistance to storage diseases has been evidenced
    in potato (Diallo et al. 2011) and also correlated to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-species
    richness (Slininger et al. 2010). Inoculation of lettuce with fungi Azotobacter
    chroococcum and Glomus fasciculatum increased the concentration of total phenolic
    compounds, anthocyanins and carotenoids, while inoculation with G. fasciculatum
    and Glomus mosseae highly increased the flavonoid content (Baslam, Garmendia,
    and Goicoechea 2011). Eftekhari, Alizadeh, and Ebrahimi ( 2012) observed an increased
    production of the flavonoid quercetin in the leaves of grape inoculated with Glomus
    sp. but the response depended on grape genotype. Inoculation of biofertilizer
    containing VAM and bacterial species considerably augmented the concentration
    of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids and phenolic acid and consequently the
    antioxidant capacity of the spinach (Khalid et al. 2017). Recent data are also
    available on positive effects of nano-fertilizers on food quality. They improve
    the vegetative and reproductive traits of fruit trees, such as strawberry, mango,
    date, coffee and grape (Zahedi, Karimi, and Teixeira da Silva 2020). In addition,
    they implement the uptake of Fe, Zn and Cu, but no paper reports if this uptake
    led to higher micronutrients level in consumable fruits and seeds. Only an increase
    in the concentration of phenols and polyphenols in pomegranate fruits is reported
    after the application of nano-selenium (Zahedi, Karimi, and Teixeira da Silva
    2020). In this emerging context, the perspective of a “green nanotechnology” should
    combine the benefits provided by nano-products in solving environmental challenges
    with the assessment and management of environmental, health, and safety risks
    potentially posed by nanoscale materials (Iavicoli et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2018).
    It is urgent to take into account all the phases in which nano-carriers may be
    found in the environment, from application into the field to potential incorporation
    into food supply and possible influences exerted by the pedo-climatic conditions
    that may all affect nanomaterial hazardous properties and risks (Iavicoli et al.
    2017; Walker et al. 2018). Conclusions Global climate change has generally negative
    effects on crop quality. In particular, the decrease of N, proteins and the essential
    micronutrients such as Fe and Zn have been shown by almost all studies examined
    in this paper. The reduction of N and essential minerals can have significant
    impacts on human nutrition. Fe and Zn deficiency is already an urgent issue in
    many parts of the world especially in regions where people depend on C3 grains
    such as wheat as their primary source of these micronutrients. Organic farming
    is the most ancient and widespread sustainable agricultural practice, but studies
    on organic food are fragmentary and contradictory, and so far there is not strong
    scientific evidence that they have better healthy properties than conventional
    food, except less pesticide content. However, organic food seems to have better
    antioxidant properties than conventional ones and this has been found also in
    response to different types of biofertilizers. The impact of nano-fertilizers
    on quality and nutritional characteristics of food is still unexplored, but their
    potential positive effects on plant growth and productivity make their utilization
    a promising technology for sustainable agriculture. PA technologies will contribute
    more and more to food safety (Gebbers and Adamchuk 2010). PA makes farming more
    transparent by improving tracking, tracing and documenting. Crop and livestock
    monitoring will give better predictions on the quality of agricultural products.
    The food chain will be easier to monitor for producers, retailers and customers.
    It will also play a significant role in terms of plant health. Diseases undetectable
    by traditional means will be prevented by automated optical sensing and intelligent
    planning options. In conclusion, we urgently need a new research and technology
    paradigm to address the important issue of climate change and its impact on agriculture.
    New dedicated fertilizers, agronomic practice, e.g. precision agriculture, and
    ad-hoc policies will invariably shape the future of agriculture. Abbreviations

  description: Sustainable agriculture is the heart of organic farming, and human
    resources are playing a vital role in directing the community toward sustainable
    development in agricultural practices. The research objective is to evaluate the
    Farmer's Knowledge (FK) in land suitability variables for crop type’s suitability
    in Perlis. After that, the collected spatial information variables applied to
    allocate the spatial distribution for four main crop types in Perlis. Besides
    that, to investigate farmer's awareness in organic farming in achieving sustainable
    agriculture and at the same time to identify young participants in the agriculture
    field. Participatory Geographical Information System (PGIS) practices and mixed-method
    approach has applied to collect spatial data information in the study area. Spatial
    data interpolated using the Kriging method in GIS software. It found that soil
    types and soil suitability are the most important variables that classed by farmers
    in land suitability evaluation. The spatial distribution map of crop suitability
    has the potential to indicate agreement or conflict with a land resource development
    for the study area. The results show the farmer's awareness in applying organic
    farming still low, with the percentage of applying organic fertilizer is 18%.
    Besides, the results indicate that the young generation has a small contribution,
    with 30% involved in the agriculture sector. Nowadays, the participation of the
    young farmers is more realistic in applied new technology for instance Precision
    Agriculture (PA) practices.

    Sustainable agriculture is the heart of organic farming, and human resources are
    playing a vital role in directing the community toward sustainable development
    in agricultural practices. The research objective is to evaluate the Farmer''s
    Knowledge (FK) in land suitability variables for crop type''s suitability in Perlis.
    After that, the collected spatial information variables applied to allocate the
    spatial distribution for four main crop types in Perlis. Besides that, to investigate
    farmer''s awareness in organic farming in achieving sustainable agriculture and
    at the same time to identify young participants in the agriculture field. Participatory
    Geographical Information System (PGIS) practices and mixed-method approach has
    applied to collect spatial data information in the study area. Spatial data interpolated
    using the Kriging method in GIS software. It found that soil types and soil suitability
    are the most important variables that classed by farmers in land suitability evaluation.
    The spatial distribution map of crop suitability has the potential to indicate
    agreement or conflict with a land resource development for the study area. The
    results show the farmer''s awareness in applying organic farming still low, with
    the percentage of applying organic fertilizer is 18%. Besides, the results indicate
    that the young generation has a small contribution, with 30% involved in the agriculture
    sector. Nowadays, the participation of the young farmers is more realistic in
    applied new technology for instance Precision Agriculture (PA) practices. Export

    Location: Kuching, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction Oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen
    (OCH) are the basic elemental macronutrients necessary for plant intake to promote
    healthy growth. These elements are requirements for plant life cycle and no other
    elements can replace their purpose [1]. OCH nutrients are expected to be sufficient
    for plants in large amounts. Water and air are its generous accessible sources.
    Oxygen is particularly used for aerobic cellular respiration. It has been the
    focal parameter of thousands of studies in analyzing water quality [2] –[4] and
    commercialized electronic sensor for instant DO measurements are already widely
    deployed, thus, making this study valuable to focus on C and H concentrations
    detection. Nutrients are decomposed into its elemental ions to be apt for plant
    intake, otherwise, plants cannot process it. Carbon is taken to plants in the
    forms of carbon dioxide (CO2) and bicarbonate (HC O 3 − ) and acts as the fundamental
    composition of plant biomolecule making almost 45% of plant structure. It is phytochemically
    used for food production and being decomposed for plant energy transport. It can
    be derived from air through decomposing cardon dioxide and from bodies of water
    that are in contact with organic soil. Total organic carbon (TOC) comprises the
    amount of carbon in organic compounds which are dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
    and non-dissolved organic carbon (NDOC). Hydrogen, on the other hand, is the basis
    of building sugars in plant and is used for electron transport to adenosine triphosphate
    (ATP) that stores energy in plant respiration process. Its concentration is measured
    through hydrogen ion ( H + ) concentration that is commonly known as the power
    of hydrogen (pH) . Plant structure is made up of about 6% hydrogen. Deficit and
    toxifying amount of carbon and hydrogen is reflective on the state of both fish
    and vegetable cultivars in an aquaponic system [5]. Carbon deficiency is visible
    on stunted plant growth. Plants cannot take up nutrients that impedes its photosynthesis.
    Hydrogen deficiency is also manifested by hibited growth as plants combines carbon
    with hydrogen to release oxygen for its internal food process. Thus, carbon and
    hydrogen are technically paired for analysis. Direct optical assessment [6], colorimetry
    and chemometrics [7], ion chromatography [8], respirogram space [9], chalkpore-microplate
    reading [10], fluorescence [11], and Raman scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance
    (NMR) spectroscopies [12] are some of the standard approaches of measuring nutrient
    concentrations in aqueous systems such as groundwater, estuaries, and saltwater.
    Likewise, hybrid sensors and gradient Fabry-Perot array [13] were extensively
    used for organic compound measurements [14]. In spite of the accuracy that these
    approaches for measuring nutrient concentrations can provide, economic factor
    is always accompanied when implementing it for continuous monitoring. Aquaphotomics
    is a variant of dynamic molecular spectrophotometry that uses electromagnetic
    spectrum through the use of spectrophotometer to determine activated water bands
    (AWB) in analysis compositional structure of a solution [12]. Light-water interaction
    produces spectral patterns that are repeating resembles highly influential molecular
    composition on the sample [15]. Visible light and near infrared spectrum have
    been the most common electromagnetic range in collecting information on water
    molecular level. Spectral scan range from 200 nm to 850 nm was performed by [6]
    to detect total organic carbon (TOC) dissolved on known concentrated solution.
    Aquaphotomics even on its early exploratory stage had been used for detecting
    cadmium toxicity in water [16] and extraction of soil profile for sustainability
    assessment [17]. Thus, aquaphotomics is a significant approach on detecting nutrient
    absorptions and concentrations for both unknown and known solutes. Despite of
    the importance of comprehensive water quality monitoring in soilless agriculture,
    there are very few studies considering carbon and hydrogen concentration measurements.
    Reduction of deployed sensors have not been taken into consideration from previous
    implementations. As of this writing, no studies have integrated aquaphotomics
    and computational intelligence for carbon and hydrogen concentration measurements
    in pond water. In this study, total organic carbon and hydrogen concentrations
    were measured using physical limnological sensors for cost reduction of water
    quality monitoring. The aim of this study is to employ aquaphotomics in detecting
    the total organic carbon and hydrogen as essential elemental nutrient biomarkers
    in aquaponic pond water for healthy growth of vegetable cultivars, use the activated
    water bands as wavelength protocol for detecting specific nutrient concentrations
    and parameterize it using multigene symbolic regression. Water samples are temperature
    adjusted to excite variations on water molecular structure and concentration readings.
    This is a novel approach to promote system simplification by lessening the number
    of deployed sensors and avoid expensive full-scale system deployment and reduction
    of energy consumption. The developed model in this study is part of the 10-module
    vision-phenotype-lettuce (VIPHLET) model used for adaptive nutrient management
    in lettuce smart farm and innovative approach on measuring chemical concentrations
    of water using physical limnological sensors. SECTION II. Materials and Methods
    The general system architecture is shown in Fig. 1 in which the input is aquaponic
    pond water sample that is put under temperature perturbation to mimic the range
    of ambient temperature in every season, then its spectral compositional information
    is determined through aquaphotomics and the resulting characteristic bands were
    used to directly measure the concentrations using laboratory-grade spectrophotometer.
    Water temperature and electrical conductivity properties are also included for
    correlation with total organic carbon and hydrogen concentrations. Matlab platform
    is the sole signal processing and computational modeling software used in this
    study, and the Arduin 0 embedded system is configured using C/C++language. Fig.
    1. Developmental architecture for total organic carbon and hydrogen concentrations
    measurement using water physical sensors Show All A. Study Site and Water Sample
    Collections Water samples were collected in triplicate levels from two zones of
    a 250 cubic meter outdoor artificial aquaponic pond located at Morong, Rizal,
    Philippines with the following coordinates: 14. 5181 ∘ N and 121.2390° E. The
    first zone is located on the middle of the pond and the second zone is located
    on the sidewalls. Three depth layers are considered for the pond namely top surface,
    middle and bottom layers. The fishpond has been functional on supplying organic
    nutrients to lettuce crops from tilapia and carp’s effluents for over a year when
    the batch of 7.5-liter water samples were taken. There are total of 5 different
    water extraction locations specified as: water surface on the middle zone (Loc.
    A); middle layer on middle zone (Loc. B); bottom layer on middle zone (Loc. C);
    water surface on sidewall (Loc. D); and middle layer on sidewall (Loc. E). The
    bottom of the pond is slightly sloped to allow smooth water flow going to hydroponic
    chamber inlet that makes uneven nutrient distribution along the pond bed. B. Data
    Description Temperature perturbation is configured from 16 to 36 ∘ C with 2 ∘
    C increments resulting to 11 adjustments using laboratory refrigerator and hot
    plate considering the room temperature is 21 ∘ C during the experimentation. For
    aquaphotomics experiment, a total of 55 water samples were used for temperature
    perturbation and wavelength sweeping. Using UV-Vis 1900 Shimadzu spectrophotometer,
    exploration of water composition propagates photon beam from 250 to 500 nm which
    lies on the far end of the ultraviolet region and the first half of the visible
    light. Spectral bandwidth was set to 5 nm resembling the resolutions of silicon
    photodiode array. For direct spectrophotometric concentrations extraction, a total
    of 165 water samples were used for temperature perturbation with 3 trials for
    each temperature level. Temperature and electrical conductivity data were acquired
    using DS18B20 weather proof temperature sensor and Gravity analog electrical conductivity
    sensor that are controlled by Arduino UNO microcontroller as shown in Fig. 2.
    Gravity pH sensor was also utilized to measure hydrogen ion concentration for
    further analysis with aquaphotomics data. C. Aquaphotomics Nutrient Biomarkers
    Detection Aquaphotomics deduces the water compositional structure by projecting
    the 250 to 500 nm wavelength photobeam across the 1-centimeter optical path distance
    of quartz crystal cuvette filled with water samples that were filtered using standard
    filter paper to eliminate granules that may possibly made the absorbance data
    erroneous. Integration time was observed to be 3 seconds. The recorded absorbance
    data for each wavelength band was recorded in two decimal digits. Fig. 2. System
    hardware architecture for water physical data collection Show All D. Activated
    Water Bands Selection The characteristic spectrums of activated water bands are
    important to be determined as these are the wavelengths that will exactly be used
    for direct spectrophotometric extractions of total organic carbon and hydrogen
    concentrations. Principal component analysis, a multidimensional reduction statistical
    approach based on singular vector decomposition (SVD), was employed to select
    the significant spectral coordinates based on variance. The water absorbance spectral
    coordinates (WASP) is constructed using an aquagrams through Microsoft Excel 2016.
    The selected spectral coordinates area {270 nm, 275 nm, 415 nm, 460 nm, 465 nm,
    470 nm, 475 nm, 480 nm, 485 nm, 490 nm, 495 nm, and 500 nm}. It projects the photon
    absorbance level on each wavelength as the aquagram value (A q λ ) by computing
    the ratio of the difference of absorbance of specific wavelength ( A λ ) and average
    value of inclusive spectra ( μ λ ) with the standard deviation of all spectra
    ( 0 λ ) [12]. E. Direct Spectrophotometric Concentrations Extraction The PCA-selected
    wavelengths were used for extracting the concentrations of total organic carbon
    and hydrogen in milligram per liter. Total organic carbon concentration was measured
    on 275 nm using persulfate reagent powder pillow based on low range Hach method
    [18]. Hydrogen concentration was measured on 415 nm using methylene blue with
    colloidal platinum (MB-Pt) reagent method [19]. These reagents were mixed with
    pond water samples, arranged for heat adjustments with submerged temperature and
    electrical conductivity sensor contacts, quickly transferred to cuvettes and placed
    inside the UV-Vis spectrophotometer with configured wavelengths. The spectrophotometer
    outputs 2-decimal concentration values for each beam integration. F. Machine Learning
    Computational Modeling for Concentrations Parameterization Total organic carbon
    and hydrogen ion concentrations on aquaponic pond water were predicted using three
    machine learning models, namely generalized processing regression (GPR), Elman
    recurrent neural network (RNN) and multigene symbolic regression genetic programming
    (MSRGP). The total organic carbon data was smoothened using Savitzky-Golay filter.
    The optimized GRP was configured using sigma of 0.13379, kernel function of ‘squared
    exponential’, beta of 1.2742, exact predict method, exact fit method, and random
    active set method. The optimized RNN was configured using three hidden layers
    of 100, 50 and 25 artificial neurons with fixed back connections to store memory.
    The optimized MSRGP was configured using population size of 100, maximum generations
    of 100, generations elapsed of 100, tournament size of 25 with activated lexicographic
    selection pressure, elite fraction of 0.7, probability of pareto tournament of
    0.7, maximum genes of 4, maximum tree depth of 5, crossover rate of 0.1, mutation
    rate of 0.14, and complexity functional set of {times’, min us’, ‘sqrt’, ‘square’,
    ‘sin’, ‘co s’, ‘exp’, ‘add3’, ‘mult3 ‘, ‘tanh’, ‘log’, ‘cube’, ‘negexp’, ‘neg’,
    ‘abs’}. Data splitting of 80-20 was employed for training and testing. The training
    dataset is the collection of 70% intended for model interpolated training and
    30% for validation. The performance of each regression model was evaluated using
    root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson’s correlation ( R 2 ) , mean absolute error
    (MAE) and inference time. SECTION III. Results and Discussions A. Extracted Nutrient
    Biomarkers After UV-Vis wavelength sweeping exploration from 250 to 500 nm, there
    is observable flat profile from 280 to 400 nm and 430 to 500 nm. The large absorbances
    peak on 275 nm and 415 nm resembling the wavelength protocol for total organic
    carbon and hydrogen that agrees with the previously determined spectral ranges
    for the said nutrients [18]–[19]. It was noticed that increasing the wavelength
    above 250 nm may result to detecting another nutrient biomarker for organic compounds
    as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. UV-Vis spectra of aquaponic pond water samples from
    five water extraction zones Show All The first six vectors have positive coefficients
    through the first principal component as they are projected to the right (Fig.
    4). Element 500 nm is the only vector with positive coefficient through the second
    principal component. Elements 275 nm and 415 nm exhibits the highest positive
    collective variances. Three non-zero value principal components (PC) were retained
    with PC3 scoring to 0.0332. Thus, it is logical to eliminate PC3 from remaining
    list of principal components for simplified system approach. It signifies that
    elements 275 nm and 415 nm have direct and significant impact with system variance
    and are reliable to be used as wavelength protocol and nutrient biomarkers in
    direct spectrophotometric extraction of total organic carbon and hydrogen concentrations.
    The absorbance levels for the activated water bands differs as the concentration
    of organic nutrients dissolved in aquaponic pond is diverse (Fig. 5). The water
    spectral pattern for locations A and B are almost identical but with different
    absorbance amplitude. Conversely, locations C and D have identical spectral pattern
    with more concentrated absorbances on location D. This water absorbance spectral
    pattern across 250 to 500 nm resembles that total organic carbon on collected
    water samples from middle layer of sidewall and pond floor is highly concentrated
    among other pond zones. Water surface at the middle of the pond exhibits 0.2805
    TOC absorbance as to compare from the 0.4348 TOC absorbance of water surface near
    sidewall. Based on the spectral pattern, it is obvious that total organic carbon
    and hydrogen concentrations on the mid-level near sidewall and pond floor near
    the pond outlet have consistency. With these nutrient dynamics, it implies that
    temperature perturbation that is normally induced naturally by the environment
    must be monitored. In closed environment agriculture, it is generally employed
    using temperature sensors submerged in the aqueous system. Fig. 4. Score-plot
    of selected PCA with highest variances resembling the Show All Fig. 5. Aquagrams
    of the pond water samples showing the spectral water information Show All The
    original total organic carbon data contains 151 samples but erratic pattern. Using
    this signal resulted to low accuracy for interpolated testing. To improve the
    model performance, Savitzky-Golay filter was used to smoothen it that resulted
    to significant improvement for regression (Fig. 6). This approach enables lowering
    adjusting the outliers in the scheme of normalization. Sensor-acquired pH data
    value ranges from 6.8882 to 9.5468. These values are the negative logarithm of
    hydrogen ions. To compute the hydrogen ions (H) in mg L −1 , this formula is used:
    H= 10 −( α ∗ pHsensor) where α is the mole/L to mg/L conversion ratio for hydrogen
    and pHsensor is the sensor-acquired pH data. Fig. 7 shows the interesting relation
    of sensor-acquired pH data and the hydrogen concentration measured using direct
    spectrophotometry. It signifies that pH sensor can relatively and indirectly measure
    hydrogen concentration in molecular level like what a UV-Vis spectrophotometer
    can do. Fig. 6. Smoothened total organic carbon concentration data using SavitzkyGolay
    filter Show All Fig. 7. UV-Vis spectra of aquaponic pond water samples from five
    water extraction zones Show All B. TOC and H Concentrations The applied optimized
    machine learning models, namely generalized processing regression, recurrent neural
    network, and multigene symbolic regression genetic programming, allowed the prediction
    of total organic carbon and hydrogen concentrations on aquaponic pond water (Fig.
    8 and 9). Generalized processing regression evaluated temperature and electrical
    conductivity sensor-acquired data with cross validation loss of 0.0302 and 0.0004
    for total organic carbon and hydrogen predictions, respectively. During testing
    phase, GPR model exhibited the least R2 performances of 0.3029 and 0.9626 for
    TOC and H predictions. Despite its architecture simplicity, its inference time
    is characterized by thrice the duration of MSRGP. Recurrent neural network performed
    better than GPR with R2 of 0.8583 and 0.9686 for TOC and H concentrations prediction.
    RNN bested all other models in terms of inference time with average of 3.5 seconds.
    The graphical form of evolved multigene symbolic TOC and H concentration models
    resulted to (1) and (2) where x1 is water temperature i n ∘ C and x2 is electrical
    conductivity in mS/cm . Both nutrient parameters have high variability resulting
    to significant model performances. MSRGP gained R2 of 0.9280 and 0.9693 in predicting
    TOC and H concentrations (Table 1). Both RNN and MSGRP optimized models resulted
    to performances above the threshold of 0.8 R2. Thus, among the optimized machine
    learning models, generalized processing regression exhibited the worst performance,
    and multigene symbolic regression genetic programming performed the best. Fig.

    total organic carbon concentrations revealed that the aquaponic pond is rich with
    this nutrient as it ranges from 6.84 to 10.2 milligrams per liter that coincides
    with the ideal 5 to 15 milligrams per liter that was previously denoted [18].
    Generally, the ideal hydrogen concentration range for aquaponic freshwater pond
    ranges from 3. 19 to 31.87 milligrams per liter [19]. The predicted hydrogen concentration
    ranges from 5.6 to 21.19 milligrams per liter. Thus, both total organic carbon
    and hydrogen concentrations of the pond study site is suitable for providing sufficient
    nutrients in the hydroponic chamber. Table I Model Evaluation For Predicting Total
    Organic Carbon and Hydrogen Concentrations On Aquaponic Pond Water Show All This
    good water quality described by the developed nutrient dynamics map (Fig. 10)
    projects that increase in temperature deliberately results to decrease in TOC
    and H concentrations provided that electrical conductivity is also strengthened.
    It is also an important finding that TOC concentration above 0.4 mSc m −1 of electrical
    conductivity may result to consistency even in increasing water temperature. Likewise,
    hydrogen concentration significantly drops when electrical conductivity is rated
    0.4 mSc m −1 . Fig. 10. TOC and hydrogen concentration nutrient dynamics map Show
    All It was also realized that lessening the number of deployed sensors resulted
    to 50% reduction on energy consumption based on the number of water quality parameters
    involved which are temperature, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon,
    and hydrogen concentrations. With the developed approach, temperature and electrical
    conductivity sensors were only deployed to directly measure water temperature
    and EC, and indirectly measure TOC and H concentrations. SECTION IV. Conlusion
    and Recommendation In this study, total organic carbon and hydrogen concentrations
    were measured using physical limnological sensors for cost reduction of water
    quality monitoring of an aquaponic pond. Aquaphotomics was explored in ultraviolet
    and visible light spectrum that resulted to activated water bands in determining
    the nutrient biomarkers of total organic carbon and hydrogen on temperature perturbed
    water. The developed water absorbance spectral pattern through aquagrams emphasized
    the 275 nm and 415 nm activated bands that agree with previous detected approach
    in determining the TOC and H concentrations in milligrams per liter, respectively.
    Generalized processing regression, recurrent neural network and multigene symbolic
    regression genetic programming are the optimized machine learnings used to predict
    the nutrient concentrations utilizing the temperature and electrical conductivity
    sensor-acquired data only. MSRGP bested other models based on its accuracy and
    easy implemented for Arduin 0 embedded systems since MSRGP model is a regression
    model that does not requires large library or model image that will affect the
    low computational cost feature. Overall, the developed approach of using aquaphotomics
    to determine TOC and H nutrient biomarkers and using optimized computational intelligence
    model for smart sensor application was successful and practical for full-scale
    implementation in water quality monitoring of aquaponic pond. For future studies,
    prediction of dissolved oxygen level may be included to complete the set of basic
    plant nutrients and the use of other regression model with lower complexity but
    considerable accuracy are recommended. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to

    Being able to provide food for the world''s population will be a significant concern
    for governments in the near future, and self-sufficiency in food production is
    the main criterion with which countries will struggle. It is estimated that the
    world''s population will increase to 11.8 billion by 2100 (Statistics Bureau of
    Japan, 2017). Supporting this population will not be possible unless long-term
    planning is included in the future policies of the agriculture industry, which
    has faced other new challenges over the past few decades — including food self-sufficiency
    and rural migration to cities. The number of agricultural harvestable farms worldwide
    is limited, and these farms must deal with water crises, labor shortages, natural
    phenomena, and economic issues that could markedly reduce farming opportunities.
    The change of forests to agricultural fields will also have irreversible consequences
    on the ecosystem, air pollution levels, and oxygen production. In developed countries
    such as Japan and the United States, the younger generation''s interest in agriculture
    is steadily declining because of farmers'' low income compared to office work,
    the difficulty of farm work, and changes in cultural attitudes. According to global
    agriculture statistics, the average age of farmers is 65.9 years in Japan (Statistics
    Bureau of Japan, 2017), compared to 55.9 years old in the U.S. (USDA, 2019) and
    52 years old in Iran (Asadollahpour et al., 2014). With declining farming populations,
    the majority of farmers are considered ''too old'' to handle the rigorous demands
    of the industry. According to the latest report from the Statistics Bureau of
    Japan, the number of laborers continued to decrease over the period from 1960
    to 2013 from 20.33 million (30.2% of total workers) to 13.40 million (3.7% of
    total workers). This problem and others have had a negative effect on the agricultural
    output in Japan, which was 8.47 trillion yen in 2013, down 0.7% from 2012 (Statistics
    Bureau of Japan, 2017). However, based on a Global Agricultural Productivity report,
    a 100% increase in agricultural production is necessary over the next 40 years
    (Ellen et al., 2013). It is apparent that the world will have fewer farmers, older
    farmers, limited farmland, water crises, climate change, and population growth
    in the future, all of which continue to increase the complexity of agriculture
    issues. These factors comprise a multi-variable problem that scientists must solve
    considering a single overarching challenge: how to produce more food with limited
    resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technology will be key tools
    for addressing this complicated situation. Agricultural robots (ARs) could become
    a benchmark technology for saving human society when the properly designed systems
    for agricultural unpredictable environments are achieved. ARs can work all day
    long; they can be programmed for different tasks; their efficiency can be increased
    with an optimized algorithm; and they are economically efficient in the long term.
    In the case of robot tractors, ARs can have multiple applications, and serval
    ARs can collaborate to do one or several tasks in one or more fields. However,
    there is still a long way to go before ARs can be used effectively worldwide.
    More opportunities to develop ARs with high efficiency and at reasonable economic
    cost are needed. The inception of ARs has provided a new horizon for the future
    of farming. Labor issues must be considered, but the potential capability of robotic
    science and farming experience can be merged. Some of the challenges noted above
    are related to the changes in natural resources, whereas other issues have arisen
    due to human resources. Several research groups around the world have achieved
    very promising advances in agricultural robotics. Qiao et al. (2005) used a mobile
    fruit-grading robot to study a database that was created for sweet peppers. An
    agricultural robot designed to improve the quality of products, the cost, and
    safety (especially in greenhouses) was developed by Belforte et al. (2006). Kondo
    et al. (2009) presented a machine vision system for automatic tomato harvesting.
    A wearable agri-robot mechanism for farmers was developed by Toyama and Yamamoto
    (2009b). Rajendra et al. (2009) described the methodology they used to develop
    an image processing algorithm for a strawberry harvester robot. To address the
    challenges and difficulties of daily work in an orchard on slopes, Kurashiki et
    al. (2010b) studied laser-based vehicle control for use in orchards, and they
    proposed a self-localization algorithm for 2D laser fingers for mobile robots
    (Kurashiki et al., 2010a). A paper discussing the advantages of 3D light detection
    and ranging (LIDAR) compared to traditional sensor fusion was presented by Weiss
    and Biber (2011). Kurita et al. (2012) introduced technology for automated unloading
    by a robotic head-feeding combine harvester that uses image processing. A fuzzy
    controller in a mushroom-growing hall was modeled by Faizollahzadeh Ardabili et
    al. (2016). Thanpattranon et al. (2016) were developed a control algorithm for
    a single-sensor tractor-trailer navigation system for traveling between plots
    for various in-field tasks, such as product loading/unloading using a laser range
    finder (LRF). The LRF was used to navigate vehicle and a sliding hitch bar (SHB)
    was developed to modify the operation in narrow rows and to support the navigation
    system with a wider turn for the trailer than a conventional single hitch point.
    More agricultural robots worth mentioning are a cucumber-harvesting robot (Van
    Henten et al., 2009), a robot platform in a sugar beet field (Bakker et al., 2011),
    an asparagus-harvesting robot (Dong et al., 2011), a mobile grading machine for
    citrus fruit (Kohno et al., 2011), a robot combine harvester for beans (Saito
    et al., 2013), a robotic system for paddy field farming (Tamaki et al., 2013),
    a sweet pepper harvester (Eizicovits et al., 2016), and a multi-arm robotic harvester
    (Zion et al., 2014). Robots designed to harvest strawberries (Hayashi et al.,
    2010), apples (De-An et al., 2011), white asparagus (Barawid et al., 2007), cherries
    (Tanigaki et al., 2008), tomatoes, petty-tomatoes, cucumbers, and grapes (Kondo
    et al., 1996) have been reported. Moreover, stationary robots are used for sheep
    shearing (Tanner et al., 2001), wearable robots are available for agricultural
    work (Toyama and Yamamoto, 2009a), and robot tractors have been designed (Barawid
    and Noguchi, 2011, Zhang et al., 2015). Pettersson et al. (2010) designed a magnetorheological
    robot gripper for the handling of food products with varying shapes such as carrots,
    strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes. Pettersson et al. (2011) designed an end-effector
    by the same target to handle varying small-sized crops. A pneumatic gripper equipped
    with a pressure sensor to grasp eggplants and apples was reported by Blanes et
    al. (2016). Kim et al. (2008) designed and manufactured a hybrid robotic system
    for heavy crops such as melons by combining a parallel mechanism and an end-effector.
    The above-cited papers are just a sampling of the studies in the field of autonomous
    agricultural vehicles. Thanks to many valuable reviews were presented in the field
    of agricultural autonomous vehicle. Li et al. (2009) briefly characterized the
    autonomous guidance system for agricultural vehicles (AVs) including navigation
    sensors (GPS, machine vision, dead-reckoning sensors, laser-based sensors, IMUs,
    and GDSs), computational methods for features and fuse extraction, navigation
    planners to supply control algorithms and steering controllers to control position
    and orientations. As mentioned in this paper, when the article published, the
    guidance systems had not yet been fully developed and commercialized. Mousazadeh
    (2013) also reviewed and classified the autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs)
    from the positioning and navigation point of view. He more focused on navigation
    theorems and algorithms such as an artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm
    (GA), and Kalman filter. Also, a review presented by Zhou et al. (2020) focused
    on path planning problems is a multi-modality constraint. They classified this
    issue in 3 main stages: (1) basic ingredients (shape, kinematics, and dynamics),
    (2) route planning, and (3) trajectory and motion Planning, and reviewed different
    methods applied to the Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Bochtis et al. (2014)
    presented a review of the advantages of agricultural machinery management for
    future intelligent manned and/or unmanned operations. This paper more focused
    on mechanization and its infrastructure for future smart farming in the strategic,
    tactical, operational, and evaluation levels. Vasconez et al. (2019b) reviewed
    the Human-robot interaction (HRI) where humans and robots interact to solve complicated
    problems including the agriculture industry. They compared the autonomous levels
    of field crops versus other crops that require more complicated robotic harvesting.
    They mentioned about the problem of labor shortage in some countries and how they
    struggle with it. Also, Vougioukas (2019) reviewed the challenges imposed on AAVs
    by agricultural environments which vary in conditions, canopy structures, and
    physical and/or chemical characteristics. They discussed the growth of agricultural
    production and labor shortage and presented a general review of the recent developments
    of agricultural robots and navigation, the challenges, and possible solutions.
    Lezoche et al. (2020) were presented an impressive review about Agri-food 4.0,
    the supply chains and technologies for future agriculture to understand the future
    of the Agri-Food. As mentioned in this paper, all agricultural machinery will
    incorporate electronic controls and enhance their current performance soon. Using
    sensors and drones will support the data collection (weather, animals and crops
    behaviors, and the farm life cycle). There are also more review articles about
    agricultural robotics used poultry production (Ren et al., 2020), Agriculture
    4.0 (fourth evolution in the farming technology) and its requirements (Zhai et
    al., 2020), and a general view of smart farming – challenges and advantages (Charania
    and Li, 2020). Although some of the mentioned review articles presented the sensors,
    algorithms, and control methods used in agricultural autonomous vehicles, all
    of the mentioned literature have not reviewed AAVs from the points of: (1) They
    do not provide detailed information about the configurations and operation methods
    of each sensor (Machine vision, GDS, LIDAR, …), algorithms (GA, ANN, FL, …), and
    controlling methods (Open-loop, PID control, adaptive controller), (2) most of
    them did not discuss the different types of platforms, transportation systems,
    operation functions, communication methods (internal and external), sensors, control
    units, and environment types in detail, (3) they didn’t present the development
    progress and challenges in the using of each component used in AAVs. (4) at the
    time of publishing some of the articles, some components such as guidance systems
    had not yet been fully developed and commercialized (Li et al., 2009), (5) this
    paper covers also deals with the terrain-vehicle interaction (Section 3.1.9) and
    the kinds of wheels used in AAVs (Section 2.1.3), and (6) none of the papers talked
    about the development procedure of AAVs in a research center, the connection between
    their components, the process of component development and selection, and the
    creation of an applicable study resource to develop new AAVs. In this regard,
    this paper is a structured review of AAVs developed in the laboratory of vehicle
    robotics – Hokkaido University between 1990 and 2018 by classifying the AAVs based
    on their components and categorizing each component. The many relevant investigations
    and reports are reviewed and categorized in the following sections. The overview
    of the presented paper is illustrated in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res

    presented paper. 2. The characterization of autonomous vehicles The existing autonomous
    vehicles (AVs) used for agriculture are classified herein based first on their
    main characterization. Autonomous vehicles vary based on the type of hardware
    used (see Section 2.1 below). The hardware can be a specifically developed/used
    platform equipped with different sensors and actuators. The AVs are controlled
    with the use of various control algorithms and software (Section 2.2). In addition,
    AVs have been developed, optimized, and/or tested in different farming environments
    (Section 2.2). These three aspects (hardware, controls, and the environment) comprise
    the main infrastructure used herein for evaluating the existing AVs. 2.1. The
    variation AV hardware The hardware of AVs varies based on the platform development
    procedure (Section 2.1.1), the type of platform used (Section 2.1.2), the transportation
    type (Section 2.1.3), the AV''s functionality in operation (Section 2.1.4), the
    communication type (Section 2.1.5), and the sensors used (Section 2.1.6). 2.1.1.
    The variation in platform development Autonomous vehicles must be installed on
    a mobile platform. The platform can be developed in the laboratory (these are
    known as prototype platforms), or a commercialized platform can be used. The commercialized
    platforms usually do not have all of the required functionality for autonomous
    navigation. In such a case, researchers may modify the mechanical components,
    actuators, chassis, wheels, and/or any other mechanical unit. At this stage, such
    a platform is known as a semi-commercialized platform. With a semi-commercialized
    platform, a research group can mechanically modify the commercialized platform
    based on the objective of the research. For example, an extra wheel could be added;
    a unit for controlling the power take-off (PTO) may be necessary, or an actuator
    to control the steering could be needed. Platforms with limited controllable mechanical
    functionality are generally semi-commercialized platforms. In contrast, the platform
    to be used can be developed at a factory, with all required functionality, and
    the users do no need to modify the platform mechanically. This type of platform
    is known as commercialized platforms. Generally, during the development of a new
    system, a prototype platform is first developed in the laboratory (the prototype).
    A factory then uses the prototype to manufacture the system. During the development
    flow between the laboratory and the factory, the platforms are always semi-commercialized
    since the platforms are later modified mechanically. A factory can then include
    the function that was modified for new models. Finally, when a platform reaches
    its mechanical ''maturity,'' the platform is known as a fully commercialized system
    or a commercialized platform (Fig. 2). At present, most mechanical modifications
    are included, and all mechanical components of a platform are controllable using
    an engine control unit (ECU). At this stage, a control system (or control unit)
    and all of the required components of the robotic system such as controllable
    steering, programmable ECU connected to a PC, required input/output ports to connect
    sensors and actuators, can be applied to the platform. Download : Download high-res

    procedures used in the AVs. 2.1.2. The variation in platforms The platforms used
    for agricultural machinery vary; the most common and well-known platforms are
    tractors and combine harvesters. Combines are used for harvesting tasks, but tractors
    do the majority of farm work using different implements for tillage, weeding,
    seeding, fertilizing, and watering. Some airboats and rice transplanters have
    been used recently in paddy fields, and utility vehicles are used for transportation
    in other specific cases. Thus, AV platforms can generally be divided into five
    types: tractors, combine harvesters, utility vehicles, transplanters, and airboats.
    The application and varieties of each platform is presented in Table 1. Table

    Boats Motorboat, Airboat Fertilizing, Weeding 2.1.3. The variation in transporter
    systems The transporter system is the main component of a mobile platforms and
    AVs. The four currently used transporter system types are the wheel-type, half-crawler
    type, crawler-type (continuous track), and robotic leg (Fig. 3). Each of these
    transporter systems was designed for a certain application and performance, and
    each has advantages and disadvantages. The designers of an agricultural AV must
    consider the manageability of the AV in different farming environments before
    selecting the appropriate transporter system. The differences between the transportation
    systems summarized in Table 2. Download : Download high-res image (145KB) Download

    2019). Table 2. Comparison of wheel-type, crawler-type and foot transporter system.

    Poor Spinning Good Better than Wheel Medium Turning Big place Small place Poor
    Speed High Low Low Precision Good Bad Low The common-use transporter type is wheel-based
    (Fig. 3a). This type of transporter is economically affordable, easy to repair,
    easy to design and develop, and lightweight, and it provides good steering and
    vehicle speed. However, the wheels put high pressure on the soil, which increases
    the compaction possibility. The friction is low because the wheels have a smaller
    contact surface compared to crawlers, but this can increase the possibility of
    wheelspin and reduce the efficiency. The wheels can be made of different materials
    and can provide precise maneuvering for the vehicle. The crawlers have larger
    connection surfaces, which increases the friction, reduces the wheelspin possibility,
    reduces soil compaction over the long term, and reduces the maneuvering speed
    (Fig. 3c). Compared to the wheel type, this type of transporter system is more
    complex to make and repair, and the number of components increases the cost, break
    possibility, and weight; additional disadvantages are a shorter system lifetime
    and reduced maneuverability, steering, and speed. The large contact surface enables
    crawler vehicles to maneuver in a variety of environments such as paddy fields
    and muddy agricultural fields. The first autonomous vehicles were equipped with
    wheels or crawlers, but a new generation of half-crawler vehicles has also been
    commercialized (Fig. 3b). These vehicles provide functionality that is between
    those of wheel-type and crawler-type vehicles: medium speed, medium friction,
    and medium cost. An infrequently used type of transporter system is robotic legs
    or robotic feet. This special type of transporter system is used for discontinuous
    movement applications. A transporter system with robotic legs or feet may have
    disadvantages such as high complexity, poor repairability, high cost, and limited
    maneuverability, but a robotic foot-type system is the only transporter type that
    can move on an unpredicted, uneven and complicated surface. In some special cases
    in which farmers are using an airboat to fertilize paddy fields, the transporter
    system of the airboat can be a propeller. This type of transporter is rarely used
    for agricultural AVs. 2.1.4. The variation in operation function A vehicle as
    a mechanical platform has different functionalities. In the case of agricultural
    vehicles, the number of functionalities is greater than those of vehicles used
    for daily application such as cars and buses. As shown in Fig. 4, AVs have seven
    main operation functions: steering control by a handle, forward and backward motion
    control, braking, shifting, rotary speed, hitching, and a PTO. The steering is
    usually controlled by one or more driving wheels (front wheels) in the case of
    wheel-type and half-crawler-type vehicles, and by controlling the crawlers in
    the case of crawler-type vehicles and combine harvesters. The forward/backward
    motion is mainly controlled by shifts in the wheel-type and half-crawler-type
    tractors and by the swash plate of a hydrostatic transmission (HST) system in
    crawler-type tractors and combine harvesters. The brake as a resistant unit for
    motion inhabitation, the shift as a transmission ratio changer, and the rotary
    speed of the engine are the three functionalities that are available in all vehicles.

    Fig. 4. Operation functions of AVs. (1) steering, (2) forward and backward, (3)
    brake, (4) shift, (5) rotary speed, (6) hitch, (7) PTO. The main difference between
    agricultural vehicles and other vehicles is the hitch and PTO functions. The hitch
    or three-point hitch in tractors is developed for attaching different implements
    to the tractor. This function is not available in combine harvesters. A PTO is
    a rotary shaft behind the tractor that is directly connected to the engine for
    the transmission of power to an installed implement or another vehicle. All of
    the above-mentioned functions are controllable manually (M) or using an ECU. For
    autonomous applications, all of the functions should be controllable electrically
    using a command from a personal computer (PC) connected to the ECU. With some
    platforms, some functions are not controllable electrically. In such a case, an
    electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuator could be added to make the functions
    controllable. This type of functions is referred to herein as ''controlled by
    modifications'' (CBM). For example, electric circuit modification or the addition
    of a hydraulic cylinder to the steering and brake are CBM functions. Several companies
    have recently developed agricultural vehicles that include a controllable function
    without modification. These functions are known as ''controlled without modification''
    (CWM). The CWM functions are easily controllable using a PC connected to the ECU.
    A function can also be Not available (NA); examples are a hitch or PTO in combine
    harvesters and boats. The operation functions can thus be classified in four categories:
    M, NA, CBM, and CWM. 2.1.5. The variation in communication There are two different
    communication types used in AVS: internal and external communications. Internal
    communication always is the communication between the controlling PC inside the
    vehicle and its ECU (see Section 2.1.5.1 below). External communication can be
    between the AV and another controlling unit far from the AV, such as a host-PC,
    an emergency switch, or another vehicle (Section 2.1.5.2). 2.1.5.1. The variation
    in internal communication All types of communication that can connect different
    devices and elements inside an AV are known as internal communication methods.
    In the beginning stages of AV research, the agricultural vehicles had no ECU,
    and because of that, communication between the vehicle and a PC was not possible.
    In such cases, the actuators can be controlled directly from the PC, which is
    called direct control. In the direct control method, there is no communication
    system and the control is achieved using an input/output (IO) port, an analog-to-digital
    board (AD), a digital-to-analog board (DA), and a pulse motor control board (PMC)
    as shown in Fig. 5. The IO controls the actuators and relays using output signal/commands,
    and it receives input commands from a switch. An AD is installed on a PC bus to
    receive information from sensors, and the DA and PMC control the actuators and
    motors, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Topography of direct control. When autonomous vehicles
    were later equipped with an ECU, the controlling signals from a PC were sent directly
    to the ECU, and the ECU would then control the actuators. At that time, several
    serial communication standards were becoming popular, including RS232c for low-speed
    communication, and RS422 and RS485 for a multidrop serial bus, ethernet, and universal
    serial bus (USB). The RS232c standard can communicate only between two devices
    (Fig. 6a), whereas the RS422 and RS485 standard can provide communication between
    10 and 32 devices at the same time. The RS232c had some limitations including
    a limited cable length, low data-transmission speed, and limited multi-connection
    functionality. These limitations obliged researchers to use USBs instead of RS232c
    in 1996. The use of a USB improves the speed and some other limitations, but its
    serial communication has master–slave protocol in which the slave cannot interact
    without a host, as shown in Fig. 6b. Decisions must be made from a controlling
    PC, which can increase the process time and decrease the response speed. Download

    of (a) the RS232c standard and (b) a USB. In 1990, the international communication
    protocol ISOBUS was published. The communication system of agricultural vehicles
    was adopted by the ISO 11783 standard based on Society of Automotive Engineers
    (SAE) standard J1939. With this standard, the controller area network (CAN-bus)
    was introduced (AEF, 2019). Using CAN-bus, different devices and microcontrollers
    can communicate with each other without any host PC, as shown in Fig. 7. In this
    system, several ECUs, PCs, the internet of things (IOT), and microcontrollers
    as nodes can connect with each other using a bus connection. Download : Download

    of CAN-bus. Different control units have been used to control an AV''s steering,
    forward and backward motion, brake, shift, rotary speed, hitch, PTO, user interface,
    and implements'' ECUs. In vehicle robotics laboratories, the internal communication
    of AVs was first developed based on ''direct control'' and then improved to RS232,
    and eventually the CAN-bus was used. The details of this progress are discussed
    below in Section 3.1. 2.1.5.2. The variation in external communication AVs have
    also been designed to communicate with controlling rooms, monitoring rooms, cloud
    servers, user interfaces, and separate vehicles such as a tractor, combine harvester,
    or drone. This communication requires a wireless communication system that is
    a type of external communication (Fig. 8). It can be two-way communication, one-way
    communication, or master-slave communication. Based on the application of the
    system and the target of the research, the external communication can be a Wi-Fi
    signal, Bluetooth signal, or long-term evolution (LTE) with the use of a Wi-Fi
    router, Bluetooth device, personal digital assistant (PDS), or cell phone. Download

    The external communication of AV. 2.1.6. The variation in sensors One of the main
    components of a robot is its sensors, which detect the information from the environment
    and send the related signals to the controlling unit. For agricultural vehicles,
    the sensors can be divided into three main groups: positioning sensors (Section
    2.1.6.1 below) that provide the location of the robot, attitude sensors (Section
    2.1.6.2) to provide the orientation of the robot, and safety sensors (Section
    2.1.6.3) for emergency situations. 2.1.6.1. The variation in positioning sensors
    The well-known positioning sensors for AVs are image sensors, including lateral
    navigation (LNAV), Smooth navigation (SNAV), X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV),
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), global positioning system (GPS), differential
    GPS (DGPS), and real-time kinematic - GPS (RTK-GPS). The accuracy, interval, and
    methodology of these sensors differ. The topography of image sensors (positioning
    sensors) as a positioning system is illustrated in Fig. 9. This system is composed
    of a single main system which is uploaded on a robotic platform, and two static
    image sensors as subsystems (Ishii et al., 1998a) that can control the entire
    system based on the principle of triangulation. The system calculates the robot
    position using two angles from the base line to a visual marker mounted on the
    robot and a predetermined distance (L) between two subsystems. Download : Download

    of positioning systems (image sensors) based on the principle of triangulation.
    Because the positioning system recognizes the visual marker based on chromaticity,
    two fluorescent lamps with red and white radii have been used as the visual marker
    mounted on the robot. Each subsystem is composed of a rotary encoder, a CCD camera,
    a stepper motor, and a computer. To measure the angle to the visual marker on
    the robot ( ), the rotation angle of the CCD camera ( ) and the deflection angle
    of the visual marker in an image ( ) are detected by the rotary encoder and the
    CCD camera, respectively. The controlling system performs an image analysis to
    calculate the robot''s position using the two angles from the subsystems, and
    it transfers the location data via a radio receiver (e.g., a wireless modem) (Ishii
    et al., 1998b). LNAV was an off-the-wire electromagnetic induction system with
    power cable installation around the field (Fig. 10a) (Kondo et al., 2011). This
    navigation system was developed by Kubota Co., and the cables installed around
    the field provided a magnetic field. The generated magnetic fields are strongly
    deepened with the distance from each cable. In this system, two magnetic field
    sensors were used at each side of the vehicle. To use this positioning system,
    it was necessary to manually ''teach'' the robot along the field boundary. This
    system could be effective in different weather conditions, but the cost of construction
    can increase dramatically in large fields. Download : Download high-res image

    (10) mobile station. (11) Reference station Topcon AP-L1 (Kondo et al., 2011).
    The SNAV developed by Japan Aviation Electronics Industries (JAEI) used DGPS,
    a Transcranial Magnetic Sensor (TMS), and an inertial measuring unit (IMU) (Fig.
    10b) (Kondo et al., 2011). The IMU and TMS were used to improve the interval of
    positioning system. The accuracy of SNAV was sufficient, but the costs, information
    service, and the reference station were major limitations for the use of SNAV.
    XNAV was developed by BRAIN-IAM and manufactured by Sanyo Electric Co. Generally,
    XNAV looks like an image sensor, but this positioning sensor used an optical measurement
    system (Fig. 10c) (Kondo et al., 2011). The installed target on the vehicle (Fig.
    10 (9)) was observed from the reference station, and the diagonal distance (L)
    and the horizontal angle could then be obtained. The coordination of the target
    was thus obtained. The GNSS, GPS, DGPS, and RTK-GPS are four important positioning
    systems nowadays. The general principles of GNSS, DGPS, and RTK-GPS are based
    on a global satellite navigation system (GNSS), but each has small differences
    in methodology, accuracy, topography, and application. Several GNSSs are now in
    use, including NAVSTAR (U.S.), QZSS (Japan), GLONASS (Russia), IRNSS (India),
    BeiDou-3 (China), and GALELEO (Europe). The GPS uses three satellites for the
    determination of attitude and longitude and one satellite for altitude, providing
    accuracy within 3 m. The mobile unit (rover) carries a GNSS antenna (or cellphone)
    to receive GNSS signals. DGPS enhances the position using a base station which
    has a known positional coordination. DGPS can provide accuracy of 10 cm. For some
    agriculture applications, a minimum accuracy of 5 cm is required, and thus RTK-GPS
    could the best option. RTK-GPS corrects the position of the mobile unit using
    the positional coordination of a base station, which is transferred by a transmission
    antenna. In this case, the mobile unit should carry a GNSS antenna and a radio
    antenna. Several companies currently provide both antennas in one package. Some
    positioning sensors that are commonly used in vehicle robotics laboratories along
    with their accuracy and intervals are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Different type

    The variation in attitude sensors The attitude sensor is a complementary unit
    for autonomous navigation that indicates the orientation of the vehicle. It can
    also improve the positioning accuracy using sensor fusion methods when the GPS
    signal is unavailable because of tunnels, trees, or buildings. Geomagnetic direction
    sensors (GDSs) were previously used for agricultural robots to measure the heading
    angle (Yaw). These sensors had two main problems; their accuracy is affected by
    the surrounding magnetism field, and errors resulting from vehicle inclinations
    can occur. Fiber optical gyroscope (FOG) sensors then became popular, but FOG
    sensors are quite expensive, and they are not cost-effective for use in agricultural
    robots. The inertial measurement units (IMUs) are known as the best choice for
    indicating the orientation of vehicles. These sensors can measure the quaternions,
    headings (pitch, roll and yaw velocity and indirectly pitch and roll angle, eventually
    yaw angle), linear accelerations, and gravity. An IMU consists of gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, and magnetometers are also available in some IMUs. The combination
    of an IMU and RTK-GPS with a sensor fusion method can guide vehicles with high
    accuracy. Some companies have recently offered an IMU as part of their RTK-GPS
    package. The attitude sensors commonly used in vehicle robotics laboratories are
    listed in Table 4. Table 4. Different type of attitude sensor and examples. Type

    systems. 2.1.6.3. The variation in safety sensors An autonomous vehicle should
    have a specific safety zone to prevent accidents with humans, other vehicles,
    and any other possible obstacles. This safety zone can be controlled by different
    safety sensors such as a laser scanner (2D or 3D), camera (2D, 3D, or an omni-directional
    stereo vision [OSV] camera), different switches (e.g., a tap switch, proximity
    switch, bumper switch, and emergency switch). These safety sensors can cover a
    specific safety zone (such as a 10-m-dia. circle), or it can work by physical
    force (mostly switches). The safety sensors that are frequently used in vehicle
    robotics laboratories are listed in Table 5. Table 5. Different type of safety

    classifications of sensors in the literature for mobile and autonomous vehicles
    which classify them based on (1) the type of sensing parameter, (2) the direction
    of energy, and (3) the application of sensor (Siegwart et al., 2011, Vasconez
    et al., 2019b). (1) The first and most common classification of sensors is based
    on the type of sensor''s parameters which can be internal (proprioceptive sensors)
    or external parameters (exteroceptive sensors) (Narvaez et al., 2017, Soter et
    al., 2018). The proprioceptive sensors know a sensor to measure the internal parameters
    of AVs such as encoder to measure motor speed and joint angles, or loadcells to
    measure forces. The exteroceptive sensors achieve the information from the surrounded
    environments of AVs such as LIDAR, laser-scanner, or sonar for obstacle detection
    and distance measurements (Vasconez et al., 2019a). Exteroceptive sensors are
    usually applied for the environment observation, mapping, autonomous navigation,
    action estimation, or characterization of the environment''s variables. They may
    use as a safety sensor, positioning sensor, attitude sensor, or a combination
    of them. (2) The second classification is based on the direction of energy which
    can be from the sensors (active sensors) or to the sensor (passive sensors) (Narvaez
    et al., 2017). The active sensors check the environmental reaction by emitting
    energy into the environment such as encoders, ultrasonic sensors, and laser rangefinders.
    And, the passive sensors measure ambient environmental energy entering the sensor
    such as thermal sensors and probes for temperature measurement, and cameras to
    achieve image parameters (Vasconez et al., 2018). (3) the last and most practical
    classification is based on the application of sensors which can be divided into
    ground-based beacons, heading sensors, tactile sensors, active ranging sensors,
    motion/speed sensors, and vision-based sensors (Ampatzidis et al., 2009, Narvaez
    et al., 2017). The ground-based beacons are for localization and positioning of
    AVs which is mentioned in Section 2.1.6.1 (such as GNSS, RTK-GPS, RF/Active ultrasonic/Reflective
    beacons) (Prado et al., 2018). The heading or orientation sensors are to measure
    the orientation and attitude of AVs which is mentioned in Section 2.1.6.2 as positioning
    sensors (such as IMUs, FOGs, Compass, and Inclinometers). The tactile sensors
    are for detection of physical contact which introduced as safety sensors in Section
    2.1.6.3 (such as contact switches, bumpers switches, and proximity sensors). The
    active ranging sensors check the reflectivity, time-of-flight, and geometric triangulation
    which mentioned as safety sensors in Section 2.1.6.3 (such as ultrasonic sensor,
    laser scanners, and sonar sensors). The motion/speed sensors are sensors to measure
    the velocity and acceleration of AVs relative to fixed or moving objects (such
    as Doppler radar). The last group of sensors is the vision-based sensors which
    mentioned as safety sensors in Section 2.1.6.3 and they use for visual ranging,
    image analysis, segmentation, obstacle recognition (such as CCD/CMOS camera, OSV
    camera, and visual ranging packages) (Moshou et al., 2011, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard,
    2017, Vasconez et al., 2018). 2.1.7. The variation in controlling unit The autonomous
    navigation of an AV is always controlled using a control unit. The main control
    unit is a computer (PC) with different connections. The controlling program is
    always written in the PC in various languages such as C and C#. When there was
    no ECU available in vehicles, the autonomous navigation of robots was designed
    based on a direct control system. In this type of controlling system, a PC was
    usually connected to the actuator and sensors using different AD, DA, or PMC boards
    or IO ports (Fig. 11). In this case, the control of an actuator was achieved based
    on the controlling program written in the PC, with the data received from the
    sensors. Later control units were designed to use a microcontroller such as Arduino
    or Raspberry. With this type of control unit, the pre-written program in the PC
    can control the actuator based on signals from sensors. This type of control system
    is suitable for some vehicles that have no ECU. A control unit using a microcontroller
    can play the role of an ECU for the vehicle. Download : Download high-res image
    (81KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Controlling unit. For vehicles
    that are equipped with an ECU, a PC connected to the ECU can control the system.
    Unlike a direct control system which has different control boards, in this system
    only a PC is connected to the ECU. The PC only sends the command to the ECU; the
    ECU controls the vehicle''s motion. Factories that manufacture ECUs provide an
    application programming interface (API) library for the development of a control
    algorithm based on pre-determined standard codes. In this system, some vehicle-related
    sensors and actuators are connected to the ECU, and some external sensors and
    external communication systems are connected to the PC. The communication system
    between the PC and ECU progressed from RS-232c to CAN-bus. When CAN-bus is used
    as the communication system, different ECUs for different units can be added.
    The external ECU can be connected with implements and external functions. 2.2.
    The variation in environment Autonomous vehicles have been designed for a variety
    of farming environments. The AVs can be designed to maneuver in open fields such
    as corn and soybean fields; they can be designed for orchards such as those of
    oranges and apples; and they can be designed for specific fields such as paddy
    fields. Based on the new innovations in agriculture, the target environments can
    be changed. Each environment can have specific features and limitations. In open
    fields, the sun''s radiation, the wind, and muddy soil can present different limitations.
    In orchards, the surrounding trees can reduce the efficiency of a navigation system.
    In paddy fields, muddy soil and maneuvering limitations are major concerns. The
    parameters for designing an AV can and do vary based on the farming environment.
    2.3. The variation in controlling algorithm The control algorithm is the decision
    unit of an AV. The main objective of this algorithm is the development of a kinematic
    and dynamic model to control the lateral and longitude error of the vehicle and
    thus guide the vehicle along a desired path. The kinematic model of an autonomous
    vehicle must be defined as shown in Fig. 12. The parameters include the coordination
    of the vehicle ( ), which indicated the position of the vehicle. The coordination
    can be measured by applying positioning sensors such as those used with RTK-GPS,
    the reference coordination ( ), the objective position or desired location ( ),
    and the orientation of the vehicle ( ) which is measured using attitude sensors
    such as an IMU, the steering angle (δ), the longitudinal velocity ( ), the heading
    error ( ), and the lateral error ( ). The is the difference between the heading
    angle of the vehicle and the desired angle of the path. The is the distance between
    the communication port of the vehicle and the desired path. The general kinematic
    model for autonomous vehicles is as shown in Eq. (1). The dynamic model is shown
    in Eq. (2). (1) (2) Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. General kinematic model of AVs. Then, the global coordination
    frame is as follows: (3) where is the longitudinal error and is the yaw rate velocity.
    However, in the real field conditions, the values of and can vary due to the slip
    angle and different parameters related to features of the soil. As autonomous
    navigation in agricultural fields has non-linear behavior, different logic or
    different control systems could be used to control lateral and longitudinal errors,
    such as a neural network, fuzzy logic, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
    controller, or a model predictive control (MPC). A neural network can be used
    to define the output of attitude sensors in non-linear conditions (Fig. 13a).
    When a neural network was used in 1992, GNSS and GPS was not sufficiently developed
    and/or it was too expensive for autonomous navigation, and a GDS was commonly
    used as an attitude sensor. Neural networks were used to improve the performance
    of navigation, because the image sensors (positioning sensors at that time) had
    a large interval and low accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (341KB)

    (b) Fuzzy logic, and (c) PID controller, (d) Theoretical principle of MPC. A neural
    network was composed of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output
    layer. The hidden layer could be a single or several layers based on the requirements.
    As the GDS was affected by the surrounding magnetic fields, the neural networks
    were modified to overcome the error of inclinations and magnetism. However, it
    was necessary to train the neural network, and the AV had to be trained before
    main maneuvers were performed. One of the major disadvantages of neural networks
    was the black boxes, i.e., some unidentified boxes in programming due to the hidden
    layers. The presence of such boxes resulted in some uncontrollable behaviors in
    navigation that could make the AVs dangerous. Fuzzy logic is a many-valued logic.
    To control a vehicle, there are three different functions that handle the lateral
    error based on the steering angle (Fig. 13b), which is defined as trapezoid-shaped
    curves. When the lateral error is almost zero, the controls the steering angle.
    When the lateral error starts to increase, the density of decreases and the system
    is going to use . This is the same situation when the lateral error is decreasing.
    The functions can be developed based on the required parameters in the algorithm.
    A PID controller is a type of controller that can correct the required navigation
    parameters using the feedbacked signal which produces the error value. This controller
    uses three proportional-integral-derivative functions to control the error (Fig.
    13c). PID controllers are now used as an appropriate control for autonomous navigation
    because of their high capability and controllable functions. Because of the disadvantages
    of neural networks and fussy logic, the use of a PID controller is becoming more
    popular nowadays. In this regard, mainly using two PID controllers, the dynamic
    model can be developed for the control of lateral (PID-1) and longitudinal (PID-2)
    motion by adjusting the steering angle and gas pedal command, respectively. The
    PID-1 controller is for lateral control, which consists of two control systems:
    a P control based on and a PID controller based on as shown in Eq. (4) and Fig.
    14a. The objective of this control system is to control the vehicle''s steering
    angle along a desired path. In this regard, the system tries to keep and near
    zero. (4) Download : Download high-res image (82KB) Download : Download full-size

    control (PID-2). The PID-2 controller is for longitudinal control (Fig. 14b).
    This control system adjusts the current longitude velocity of the vehicle ( )
    based on the desired velocity ( ). The velocity error ( ) comes to the PID-2 controller
    as an input value, and the PID-2 controls the gas command ( ) of the ECU. This
    can be a pedal control output for the vehicle, controlled by external actuators.
    The control function is as follows: (5) Where (6) For agriculture applications
    (Fig. 12), a simplified steering control is sometimes used as follows: (7) in
    which and are gains. The error is: (8) in which α, β, and C are constant coefficients
    in the linear equation. The , and are RTK-GPS easting and northing, respectively.
    The is: (9) The MPC is a feedback control algorithm that uses a model for a prediction
    about the feature of processes that can be used for prediction and optimized controlling
    of an AV including steering angle and velocity. There are many reasons to use
    the MPC controller: 1. The MPC can handle multi-input and multi-output (MIMO)
    systems the same as ANN. This functionality is useful when it is predicted that
    there are some interactions between inputs and outputs (Fig. 15). The MPC consists
    of three parts: prediction model, rolling optimization, and feedback adjustment.
    In an AV the steering wheel angle can affect the velocity output because of wheel
    slip or other possible reasons. Using the PID controller can make the controlling
    algorithm more complicated because two PID control loop would operate independently
    of each other. As if there are no interactions between loops, designing larger
    systems would be even challenging. The advantage of MPC is its multivariable controller
    that controls the outputs simultaneously by consideration of all the interactions
    between system variables. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download

    constraints which are important because violating them leads AVs to undesired
    consequences. An AV must obey speed limits and maintain a safe distance from other
    vehicles, AVs (in the multi-robot system), and obstacles. They are also constraints
    due to the physical limitations of AVs such as limits on acceleration. If the
    AV works based on an MPC algorithm, the controller would track a desired trajectory
    while satisfying all these constraints. 3. The MPC has preview capability which
    is similar to feedback control. When an AV travels on a curvy path or would turn
    at the headland if the controller doesn’t know that the corner coming ahead, the
    AV only be able to apply the brake while it takes the corner. However, the AV
    equipped with a safety sensor like a camera which provides trajectory feature,
    the controller will know in advance about the upcoming corner. So, it can brake
    sufficiently to safely stay in the lane. The MPC can easily incorporate future
    reference information into the control problem to improve controller performance.
    The MPC has all the advantages a bow mentioned but to apply this algorithm, a
    powerful and fast processor with a large memory required. This is because the
    MPC solves an online optimization problem at each time stem. Thanks to a valuable
    review paper about the MPC, its development procedure, and its application in
    agriculture by Ding et al. (2018). The paper explained different types of MPC
    such as hybrid MPC, adaptive MPC, robust MPC, nonlinear MPC, tube-based MPC, stochastic
    MPC, distributed MPC, and explicit MPC which were developed to improve the disadvantages
    of PID, ANN, and other controllers. 2.4. Performance indicators The performance
    of an AV can generally be defined using two main parameters: and . When an AV
    is being developed, these two parameters must be defined (Fig. 16a). The determination
    of whether the designed vehicle is accurate enough or not is based on these two
    parameters. In Japan, the required lateral error must be ≤8 cm, because the average
    distance between crop rows is 66 cm, whereas the width of wheels or crawlers is
    ~50 cm. In this case, the maximum accuracy of 8 cm can be acceptable for AVs (Fig.
    16b). Otherwise, the vehicle can damage the crop rows and the efficiency of AV
    can be dramatically decreased. Download : Download high-res image (119KB) Download

    maximum limitation of lateral error. For the determination of the values of and
    , the root means square error (RMSE) must be defined. The average values cannot
    be the representative of the values because an autonomous vehicle can have an
    average error of zero but still show high turbulence in lateral and heading control.
    The maximum and minimum values can be used as the sub-main parameters. After the
    evaluation of each AV based on the different indicators described here in Section
    3.7, the performance indicators of all AVs will be compared. 3. Literature review
    results 3.1. Autonomous vehicle in Hokkaido university The laboratory of vehicle
    robotics (VeBots) at Hokkaido University is one of the pioneer laboratories studying
    autonomous vehicles (Roshanianfard). In this section, the VeBots studies conducted
    between 1990 and 2018 are summarized, and the development component for each AV
    is discussed. The AVs developed at the VeBots lab have gone through several evolutions
    from a path planning system in 1997 to a multi-robot tractor (multi-RTs) system
    and intelligent systems (Roshanianfard and Noguchi, 2020) in 2018. The 12 VeBots
    lab projects are introduced in the following section with ''AV-n'' titles; the
    n is the project number. Table 6 provides a general description of each projects
    (which described in Section 3 and illustrated in Fig. 21) and a summary of the
    variety in platform types, transportation systems, and mobile platforms. The development
    procedure for autonomous agriculture vehicles can be divided into three eras:
    the development of technology (AV-1 to AV-3), commercialization (AV-4 to AV-11),
    and intelligent systems (AV-12 and AV-13). During the development era, the main
    target was designing, manufacturing, and evaluating an autonomous tractor that
    can maneuver in fields with little human interposition. At the end of that approx.
    8-year era, the AV-3 could maneuver autonomously with high accuracy. Table 6.

    Innovation Promotion Program. After this technology was established, laboratories
    decided to commercialize their systems and apply them on different platforms.
    A collaboration between Hokkaido University and the University of Illinois produced
    the AV-4. In VeBots laboratory then developed another system by applying autonomous
    system to a crawler-type tractor (AV-5; model CT801, Yanmar), a utility vehicle
    (AV-6; E-Gator, John Deere), a commercialized wheel-type tractor (AV-7; model
    EG83, Yanmar), a combine harvester (AV-8; model AG1100, Yanmar), an airboat (AV-9;
    model RB-26, Yanmar), a rice transplanter (AV-10; model EP8D, Kubota), and a half-crawler-type
    tractor (AV-11; model EG105, Yanmar). After the VeBots laboratory successfully
    expanded their technology, the multi-robot tractor (AV-12; model EG453, Yanmar)
    and the robotic harvesting system for heavy-weight crops (AV-13; model YT5113,
    Yanmar) were developed. The detailed explanations of each systems is presented
    in the following sections. 3.1.1. AV-1 Noguchi et al. (1992) introduced the first
    robot tractor from the VeBots lab in a paper titled “A Study of an Intelligent
    Industrial Vehicle with a Neural Network” at the Second Intelligent Systems Symposium–Japan
    in 1992. This was the first authentic step in the development of an intelligent
    autonomous vehicle for agricultural applications. Before that study, several research
    groups had designed agricultural vehicles controlled on a predetermined path with
    the use of mechanical, optical, ultrasonic, or radio guidance, and in some cases
    using leader cables. Each of these methodologies has specific disadvantages (e.g.,
    large errors, lack of communication, and positioning errors) which made them unsuitable
    for use with an auto-guidance system. At that time, the lack of a stable and accurate
    position-sensing system necessitated the development of different positioning
    systems. The GNSS and GPS became available in 1990 only for military applications,
    and Noguchi et al. (1996) then developed a mobile [42] then developed a mobile
    agricultural robot that used a geomagnetic direction sensor (GDS) and image sensors
    (Ishii, 1997). Their objective was to establish a mobile robotic system for agricultural
    applications that can detect its location using a positioning system and a heading
    angle sensor. They investigated a mobile robot that could be controlled by positions
    obtained from the image sensors and heading angles from a GDS. As shown in Fig.
    21 (AV-1), this mobile robot tractor (AV-1) was a small, prototype, rear-wheel-drive
    tractor with a petrol engine that could electrically control the steering angle
    ( ) using a potentiometer (max. ±35° that improved to ±40° (Noguchi and Terao,
    1997)) and the rotation of a rear wheel by a rotary encoder (max. 7°/s). It was
    also equipped with a controllable clutch and a brake using a computer which provided
    movement speed in the range of 0.4–1.2 m/s. In this AV, the image sensors were
    used for the positioning system. In a robotic system, not only the location of
    the robot should be predetermined as auto-guidance input; the orientation of the
    system should also be recognized. In 1996, GDSs were popular as low-cost sensors
    for measuring the heading angle ( ), and that mounted a GDS almost 1 m above a
    robot tractor to avoid the noise effect. They also corrected the GDS outputs using
    an inclination sensor. The heading angle could measure roll and pitch directions
    in the range of 360° ± 6°. Using a GDS involved two main errors: the error due
    to the magnetism which exists around the robot, and the error from the robot inclinations.
    In this regard, Noguchi et al. (1996) developed a neural network to refine the
    GDS output. Their neural network was composed of two networks: a correction network
    for vehicle inclinations, and a correction network for the magnetism that surrounds
    the robot (Fig. 17, left). The training data of the neural network were obtained
    by giving the tested robot the inclinations in the outdoor environment. Download

    The neural network method for refining the geomagnetic direction sensor output
    (left), for motion of a robot tractor (right). Ishii et al. (1994) compared their
    neural network and a PID controller in order to identify the best control system
    for a robot tractor as a vehicle with a nonlinear kinematic system. The results
    indicated that the neural network controller, with a maximum error of 7.5 cm and
    0.105 rad, had an accuracy higher than that of the PID controller (max. error
    of 31 cm and 0.195 rad). Noguchi and Terao (1997) later developed a control technique
    that used a combination of a neural network and a genetic algorithm (GA) which
    was able to create a suboptimal path for the developed robot tractor (Fig. 17,
    right). The results of their research showed that the RMSE of forward, lateral,
    and yaw angular velocities were 0.0171 m/s, 0.0155 m/s, and 0.0156 rad/s, respectively.
    The developed method was able to effectively determine a maneuver path for the
    robot tractor. The control algorithm and guidance geometry of the robot are shown
    in Fig. 18. Based on these, the robot could measure the angle of the base line
    using the GDS before the robot''s autonomous operation. Next, the target positions
    (which were previously measured using the positioning system) and the order of
    positions for arrival are indicated to the robot. After this procedure, the robot
    turns to the direction of the first target position using the data from the GDS.
    The straight-line path from the current position to the first target position
    (i = 1) can be created. Download : Download high-res image (114KB) Download :

    and displacement errors. The parameters and are the gains which were experimentally
    determined to achieve satisfactory control stability and accuracy. The parameter
    d is the displacement, is the path direction of the GDS, and is the measured heading
    angle. A trial run of the robot was conducted on grassland at 0.5 m/s (Ishii et
    al., 1995), and the results showed that the RMSE of the neural network method
    (1°) was almost 20% that of the conventional method (5.7°). The absolute maximum
    error and the RMSE of the position for the predetermined path were 51 cm and 23
    cm, respectively. The maximum errors of the direction for the conventional and
    neural network methods were approx. 14° and 1°, respectively. The average error
    of the final position for each target position was found to be approx. 40 cm.
    This error was caused by measurement error of the angles, a time delay, and the
    measurement interval of the positioning system. The above results clearly indicated
    that the neural network method was more effective than the conventional method
    because the angle detected from the GDS indicate more precise values. This result
    can be attributed not only to the position error, but also to the poor steering
    response due to the lack of power of the stepper motor with which the robot was
    equipped. It seemed that the position error of the robot was satisfactory for
    transport work in a field, but the measurable area of the positioning system should
    be increased for practical uses. In addition, more accurate measurements of the
    robot position are required for various farm operations. 3.1.2. AV-2 Noguchi and
    his colleagues were able to successfully develop their first autonomous vehicle,
    but the navigation system and interval of the vehicle required some modification.
    The accuracy of a positioning system should be optimized, and the communication
    time delay between a mobile vehicle and station should be kept to a minimum. Yukumoto
    et al. (2000a) developed an autonomous agricultural robot that can find a position
    with an error <5 cm (Yukumoto et al., 2000b); the positioning error was almost
    40 cm when they used image sensors and the principle of triangulation. In another
    study, Yukumoto et al. (2000a) used a Kubota tractor (model GL320) (Kubota Co.,
    2018) as a platform equipped with a TMS (geomagnetic) heading sensor, a control
    box, and a reflector for the navigation system. The configuration of this robot
    tractor (AV-2), named ROBOTRA, is shown in Fig. 21 (AV-2). For newly developed
    autonomous systems with limited experimental data, it is essential to evaluate
    different auto-guidance navigation systems. Yukumoto et al. (2000a) designed and
    evaluated three different navigation systems: (1) a system using an off-the-wire
    method, named LNAV, (2) a method based on a combination of a DGPS and an inertial
    navigation system (INS) named ''SNAV,'' and (3) an optical method named XNAV that
    uses two different types of reference stations, i.e., XNAV and AP-L1. LNAV was
    developed by Kubota Co. (Tokyo). SNAV was developed by Japan Aviation Electronics
    Industries (Tokyo). XNAV was designed by BRAIN-IAM (The Institute of Agricultural
    Machinery, Saitama, Japan), and XNAV by AP-L1 was developed by Topcon Co. (Tokyo).
    The experiments were performed in a 100 × 150 m paddy field at the speed of 0.5
    m/s. The results indicated the following positioning accuracy and interval values:
    LNAV, 50 mm and 0.1 s; SNAV, 100 mm and 0.1 s; XNAV, 50 mm and 0.52 s; and XNAV
    by AP-L1 10 mm and 0.5 s (Table 7). However, the interval of the SNAV system improved
    when the system was equipped with an IMU. The XNAV results with the reference
    station AP-L1 were the most satisfactory. Table 7. Specifications of different
    navigation systems used with the ROBOTRA robot tractor. Navigation system LNAV

    (s) 0.1 1 0.1 0.52 0.5 The four navigation systems described above were costly,
    and this was a commercialization limitation. To reduce the cost of orientation
    detection, Mizushima et al. (2000) developed a sensor fusion method (Kalman filter)
    that uses a GDS and a fiber optical gyroscope (FOG) based on dead reckoning. They
    constructed the kinematic model of the vehicle and conducted experiments with
    three autonomous guidance systems: GDS (FGM-300A) alone, FOG (JG35FD) alone, and
    the sensor fusion mode. They set three GDS or FOG sensor to make an IMU for measuring
    the roll, pitch, and yaw angles. The results showed that the lateral offsets of
    the GDS, FOG, and sensor fusion were 200, 400, and 61 mm, respectively, indicating
    that the sensor fusion can support maneuvers more accurately. They then applied
    the sensor fusion method on a Kubota GL320 platform, operated the vehicle manually,
    and collected the positioning data using RTK-GPS (MS750, Trimble Ltd.) with accuracy
    of ±2 cm\\pm2. The results indicated that the RMSE of the lateral offset was 38
    mm, the maximum error from the regression line was 100 mm, and the angular error
    was 0.004°. Mizushima et al. (2000) also reported that when the geomagnetic field
    around the sensor increased, the RMSE of the lateral offset, the maximum error
    from the regression line, and the angular error could increase to 92 mm, 170 mm,
    and 0.057°, respectively. However, their developed sensor fusion method improved
    the auto-guidance performance more accurately compared to the use of a single
    navigation sensor, and the limitation of GDS due to the geomagnetic field could
    decrease the performance accuracy. Mizushima et al. (2011) later developed a low-cost
    attitude sensor composed of three vibratory gyroscopes (Gyrostar ENV-05F-03, Murata
    Manufacturing Co., Nagaokakyo, Japan), two inclinometers (D5R-L02-15, Omron Co.,
    Kyoto, Japan), and a sensor fusion algorithm. This attitude sensor could measure
    the roll, pitch, and yaw angles with RMSE values of 0.43°, 0.61°, and 0.64°, respectively
    to improve the positioning accuracy of the vehicle in a sloping field from 25.9
    cm to 3 cm and in a bumpy field from 8.4 cm to 3.7 cm. This low-cost attitude
    sensor provided high accuracy at a price (USD $500) that was only 5% of the cost
    of previous IMUs such as combined TMS or FOG sensors. To reduce the price of attitude
    sensors such as FOG and GDS, Liu et al. (2014) evaluated a low-cost IMU (S4E5A0A0,
    Seiko Epson Co., Suwa, Japan) using a mean filter for pre-procession and Kalman
    filter sensor fusion. They aimed to provide acceptable accuracy and attitude.
    The navigations systems that are dependent on satellite signals have shown weak
    performance in covered areas such as tunnels or orchards surrounded by trees.
    Since some agricultural fields include buildings, trees or different objects,
    sometimes RTK-GPS cannot work efficiently. Tsubota et al. (2004) thus developed
    an automatic guidance system that uses a 2D laser scanner (LM291) attached on
    the front of a robot tractor, a virtual reference station for RTK-GPS, and an
    IMU. Their test results showed that the lateral and heading errors of the system
    were 60 mm and 3°, respectively. These results were good enough to autonomously
    operate the robot tractor inside a coconut field (Barawid et al., 2008a). Those
    authors recommended further modifications for the improvement of the applications,
    capability, and performance of this robot tractor by including different applications
    or the cooperation of several robot tractors. 3.1.3. AV-3 To improve the efficiency
    of their developed autonomous tractor, Kise et al. (2001) designed another robot
    tractor that was able to maneuver in a field based on a geographic information
    system (GIS) predetermined path for different applications. They evaluated a robot
    tractor engaged in different agricultural work in actual fields. The configuration
    of this robot tractor (AV-3) is shown in Fig. 21. This was a modified Kubota MD77
    robot tractor (Kubota Co., 2018) equipped with RTK-GPS (#MS750, Trimble, Sunnyvale,
    CA), FOG sensor (#JS35-FD, JAEI), and emergency switches. The data communication
    between the ECU and a personal computer was accomplished with CAN-bus. Because
    of FOG drift, a Kalman filter was applied to the control algorithm. This sensor
    fusion method was proposed by Michio et al. [56], and it could estimate the heading
    angle with 45-mm accuracy on different types of paths (straight, curve, and turns).
    The AV-3 robot tractor was tested in a field at the operation speed of 1.5 m/s,
    and the results indicated that the robot tractor could maneuver based on the predetermined
    path with a lateral error of 6 cm and a heading error of 1.3°. The system could
    also operate a rotary tillage implement with satisfactory required parameters
    (Michio et al., 2001). Noguchi et al. (2001a) tested the same robot tractor by
    adding an IMU (a three-axis FOG sensor, #JCS7401A, JAEI) to the control configuration.
    They also used the same sensor fusion method, and they tested the robot tractor
    at a speed of 2.5 m/s in a soybean field in different operations including tillage,
    planting, fertilizing, and cultivating (Noguchi et al., 2002). The results demonstrated
    that the applied sensor fusion system with an IMU improved the accuracy of maneuvers,
    although the lateral error of the robot tractor was 30 mm. Those authors did not
    mention the heading error results in that study, but this error can be expected
    to improve (Mizushima et al., 2002). Mizushima et al. (2005) obtained the same
    heading errors (1.59°, 0.41°, and 0.65° in the yaw, roll and pitch angles, respectively)
    when they used a microcomputer (#H8S2612, Renesas Co.) instead of a personal computer.
    Because a robot tractor should be able to maneuver for various types of operation,
    the turning task at the end of a field remained a serious problem to solve. Noguchi
    et al. (2001b) addressed this problem by developing a switch-back turning function
    based on a spline function. They conducted this research by a computer simulation
    and real-world experimentation. The computer simulation determined the desired
    motion path, and they applied the developed function to the robot tractor (AV-3).
    The turning function was composed of a forward and backward movement. The experimental
    results confirmed that the system could complete all turns successfully (Kise
    et al., 2002a). The positioning error was 70 mm overall for the turns (Kise et
    al., 2002b). Yokota et al. (2005) later installed a 2D laser scanner (#LMS291,
    SICK, Minneapolis, MN) on top of the robot tractor to generate a 3D GIS map that
    could be used for the collection of field information for precise farming. They
    were able to generate a map with a positioning error of 65 cm and an attitude
    error of 19 cm. The same laser scanner was installed by Barawid et al. (2007)
    on the front of a tractor (70 cm above the ground) to develop an autonomous navigation
    system that can travel between trees in an orchard. After calibration Barawid
    et al. (2008b), the completed tests at various speeds (0.36, 0.48, 0.62, 0.86,
    1.23, and 1.43 m/s) indicated that the best heading and lateral were 0.5° and
    50 mm respectively when the robot''s speed was 0.36 m/s. Those results, in a comparison
    with the system developed by Tsubota et al. (2004) for the second robot tractor
    (AV-2) revealed that the heading error and lateral error were improved from 60
    to 50 mm and from 3° to 1.5°, respectively, demonstrating that autonomous navigation
    using different navigation and attitude sensors was significantly improved. When
    a third generation of robot tractors was being developed, it was necessary to
    devise a communication system between two robots as multi-robot cooperation. A
    system that could connect two independent robot tractors with sufficient safety
    was desired. Noguchi et al. (2004) presented a master-slave system for farm applications.
    Their system consisted of two algorithms: a GoTo algorithm (the slave is guided
    to go to some predetermined position or path), and a FOLLOW algorithm (the slave
    mimics the master''s behaviors by a lateral offset) as shown in Fig. 19. Download

    GOTO and FOLLOW algorithms for a master-slave robot system. To increase the safety
    of robot tractor operations, Yang and Noguchi (2012) created a human detection
    system that uses omnidirectional stereovision (OSV) in a 3D panorama image. They
    used two multi-lens-based high-definition omnidirectional cameras and two RTK-GPS
    systems. The position of an obstacle (a human, height 1.7 m) was detected using
    the RTK-GPS installed on the human''s helmet, and this was compared with the results
    obtained with the OSV system. The RMSE of the distance error and maximum error
    between the RTK-GPS data and the OSV data were 0.49 and 1 m, respectively. The
    OSV system also successfully detected the direction of obstacle movement. Those
    results demonstrated that the system designed by Yang and Noguchi can detect a
    mobile or fixed obstacle in the daytime, and the accuracy of the system was better
    than those of laser scanners, ultrasonic sensors, and infrared sensors. Using
    an OSV method could counteract the drawbacks of the above-mentioned sensors because
    of the inconsistency of appearance information such as the color of the obstacle.
    Jongmin (2014) later improved the performance of a robot tractor and a combine
    harvester for working during the nighttime. 3.1.4. AV-4 In 1997, the VeBots laboratory
    collaborated with the University of Illinois to learn the latter''s agricultural
    robot technology. Zhang et al. (1999) designed a robot tractor [70] designed a
    robot tractor (AV-4) that uses DGPS, a FOG sensor, and a camera with a positioning
    error < 150 mm and a steering error of <0.4° at the travelling speed of 3.6 m/s.
    They installed navigation sensors, steering sensors, and a control unit on a modified
    Case-IH 7220 tractor (Case-IH Corp.) as shown in Fig. 21 (AV-4). Noguchi et al.
    (1999) later developed an intelligent vision system for a robot tractor that could
    classify crops. They used fuzzy logic (FL) for crop classification, a genetic
    algorithm (GA) for the FL optimization of vision system, an artificial neural
    network (Aneural network) to estimate the crop height, and GIS for map creation.
    The system was expected to have a positioning accuracy of 200 mm. The developed
    system was able to accurately classify the estimated weight and height of soybean
    crops. Image processing to detect orientation in which the positioning error was
    improved to 44.7 mm was reported by Pinto et al. (2000). The heading error of
    this guidance algorithm was 1.26°, which is greater than the error afforded by
    the sensor fusion method. The sensor fusion algorithm of the robot tractor (AV-4)
    was improved and recorded by Monte et al. (2000) as a patent entitled “Sensor-fusion
    navigator for automated guidance of off-road vehicles” in 2002. 3.1.5. AV-5 Hokkaido
    Island is the northernmost island in Japan, with a long winter and an average
    winter snowfall of 1 m. Only five months of the year can be used to cultivate
    rice, and the muddy rice fields decrease the efficiency of wheel-tractors. Takai
    et al. (2010) designed a crawler robot tractor (AV-5) by applying RTK-GPS (Legacy-E,
    Topcon) with a virtual reference station (VRS) and an IMU (#JCS-7401A, JAEI) on
    a modified crawler-type tractor (Model CT801, Yanmar, Osaka, Japan) as shown in
    Fig. 21 (AV-5). The least squares method (LSM) was used for the sensor fusion;
    the navigation map was provided by the GIS, and the control of each crawler motion
    was provided by a digital-to-analog converter of the ECU (Takai et al., 2014).
    At the speed of 0.6 m/s, the robot tractor''s heading error was 0.22° and the
    positioning error was 14 mm, indicating that the maneuvering of this full-crawler
    robot tractor was more accurate than that of wheel-type robot tractors. This could
    be because of the specifications of crawlers (which can provide stable motion),
    or it could be due to the low-speed operation. The positioning error and heading
    error of system were as follows: at the speed of 0.6 m/s, 10 mm and 0.24°; at
    0.9 m/s, 18 mm and 0.47°; at 1.3 m/s, 29 mm and 0.76°; at 1.7 m/s, 22.3 mm and
    0.63°; and at 2 m/s, 18 mm and 0.54° (Takai et al., 2011). To increase the safety
    of the robotic maneuver, three types of safety sensors, i.e., a 2D laser scanner
    (#LMS291, SICK), a tap switch (#T5-16, Tapeswitch Japan, Matsudo, Japan), and
    two proximity switch sensors (#ED-130, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) were later used.
    3.1.6. AV-6 In the subsequent research by Barawid et al. (2008a) in their efforts
    to develop an automatic guidance system for orchards in 2008, Barawid and Noguchi
    (2010) extended their studies by developing a small, low-cost robotic vehicle
    (AV-6) that uses an electric power source instead of fuel. They used an electric
    utility vehicle (E-Gator, John Deere Co., Moline, IL) because of its easy maintenance
    and energy efficiency (Fig. 21). The E-Gator was modified to have controllable
    steering, movement, and speed by applying an ECU that was connected to a personal
    computer using CAN-bus. An RTK-GPS sensor (#MS750, Trimble) and an IMU (#VN-100,
    JAEI) were used as positioning and attitude sensors, respectively. A proper motor
    as an electric engine was selected based on the vehicle maneuver in on-road and
    off-road conditions, and then the steering of vehicle was calibrated. The AV-6
    was evaluated in straight line tests, and the results showed that at the speeds
    of 0.86, 1.52, and 1.61 m/s there was a lateral error of 80, 180, and 410 mm and
    heading error of 1.23°, 3.17°, and 7.67°, respectively. The performance of this
    robot was compared with that of the robot tractor AV-3 (MD77) described above,
    which was used a wheel-type tractor. The results indicated that the electric vehicle
    AV-6 was more accurate than the fuel robot tractor AV-3 regarding positioning
    and attitude, although charging the batteries of the electric vehicle can be a
    limitation for long applications. Barawid and Noguchi (2011) attached a camera
    on an AV-6 to develop a follower vehicle that uses target recognition. The system
    was observed to be able to follow a mobile target with a heading error of 4.6°
    and a lateral error of 1 m at the speed of 1.1 m/s (Barawid and Noguchi, 2011).
    Yin et al. (2013) also developed an obstacle detection system using a 3D camera
    (PMD CamCube 2.0) which had a lateral error of 56 mm and 71 mm in static and dynamic
    situations, respectively. The maximum positioning accuracy of 100 and 184 mm with
    an RMSE of 56 and 71 mm was achieved in static and dynamic motion, respectively
    (Yang, 2013b, Barawid, 2011). Ospina and Noguchi (2016) used an AV-6 robot vehicle
    to estimate dynamic parameters and improve the efficiency of autonomous navigation
    in order to reduce the tire sideslip effect. The main objective was to dynamically
    model the relationship between the sideslip angle of the platform and the yaw
    rate (as outputs) and the vehicle velocity and steering angle (as inputs) using
    bicycle geometrical and dynamic models. They used potentiometers (#CPP-60, Midori
    Precisions, Tokyo) on one of the steering wheels to provide the steering angle,
    plus a microcontroller and a computer for communication and data processing. The
    vehicle was tested on a flat concrete surface. The comparison of experimental
    results and the modeled data confirmed that the developed model can be used for
    robotic vehicles with an estimate of dynamic parameters; however, some modification
    was needed because of the non-linearity of the agriculture field conditions. Ospina
    and Noguchi (2018) later evaluated their developed model in different soil conditions
    including a flat experimental field, dry soil conditions, and wet soil conditions
    to find a relation between the tire''s lateral forces and slip angles in terms
    of soil moisture content and cone index. This study was done to improve the automatic
    steering controller systems of AVs. The results showed that the model could give
    a more accurate description of the relation between the tire''s lateral forces
    and slip angles and could be applied to agricultural field conditions with slight
    modifications. 3.1.7. AV-7 Yang et al. (2016) developed a CAN-bus-based robot
    tractor (AV-7) (Fig. 21). They applied an RTK-GPS sensor (#AGI3, Topcon), an IMU,
    OSV, and two laser scanners (front and rear, and a 2D laser scanner with 100-mm
    accuracy (Yang and Noguchi, 2014)) as safety sensors, a personal computer, two
    CAN-buses (CAN-1: internal communication between the tractor''s ECU and the sensors
    and actuators, CAN-2: communication between the PC and the robot tractor) on a
    wheel-type tractor (#EG83, Yanmar). Three experiments were conducted in a rectangular
    agricultural field with eight paths with 5-m intervals and a turning algorithm
    developed by Kise et al. (2002b). The experiments were performed at (1) an experimental
    farm, without implements for an accuracy evaluation (at 1 m/s speed); (2) at a
    soybean field with a spraying implement for an evaluation of non-straight path
    navigation (the speed was not reported); and (3) at a normal 2-ha agricultural
    field for almost 5 hr during the night-time for a test of the stability of the
    system for long-term work (speed: 0.6 m/s). At the first, second, and third experiments
    the heading error and lateral error were 0.57°, 0.77°, and 0.75°, and 50, 20,
    and 40 mm, respectively. At the second test, the heading error was increased because
    of the spraying implement''s weight. Compared to the previously developed robot
    tractors (AV-6 and before), the navigation parameters were clearly improved in
    this robot tractor (AV-7). The third experiment was also the first reported experiment
    conducted in the absence of daylight. The efficiency of farm work could increase
    if one driver could control two tractors, and if a robot tractor could follow
    another human-driven tractor (Noguchi, 2015). (Zhang et al., 2014a) developed
    an algorithm for the AV-7 robot tractor to follow an AV-3 tractor that was operated
    manually. The robot tractor was equipped with wireless video transmission, four
    cameras, a laser scanner, and a Bluetooth device. The best distance between the
    two tractors was 150 m. The experiments were done on six paths, with a U-turning
    method, speed of 0.9 m/s, and when the robot tractor moved before the human-driven
    tractor moved. The results showed that this system a had lateral error (straight
    line and turning) of 30 mm and a heading error of 0.71° (Zhang et al., 2013a).
    The lateral error of the human-driven tractor was improved from 60 mm to 30 mm
    because it followed the robot tractor (Zhang et al., 2015, Zhang, 2014a, Yang,
    2013a). 3.1.8. AV-8 Zhang et al. (2013b) developed a robot combine harvester (AV-8)
    for different applications (Fig. 21). They used a commercial combine harvester
    (Model AG1100, Yanmar) equipped with RTK-GPS + IMU (#AGI3, Topcon). A disadvantage
    of the AGI3 Topcon RTK-GPS was that it should be used at speeds > 3 m/s, which
    probably decreases the efficiency of autonomous vehicles (Zhang, 2014b). After
    Zhang et al. evaluated the AV-8 in a straight-line test in the field, the RTK-GPS
    installation location was modified. The experimental results demonstrated that
    the developed robot combine harvester had a heading error of 0.92° and a lateral
    error of 34.7 mm at the traveling speed of 1.0 m/s. This robot combine harvester
    was clearly more accurate than the previous robot tractors due to its crawlers.
    In the case of robot tractor AV-5, its accuracy was already in a comparison with
    other robot tractors with similar horse power values. This is because the crawlers
    have a greater connection surface, which reduces the momentary heading fluctuations.
    Zhang et al. later optimized the control parameters by developing a kinematic
    model for steering and turning functions, and the robot was retested (Zhang et
    al., 2014b). They reported that the performance of the robot was optimized at
    the speed of 1.2 m/s when the optimized lateral error was 250 mm; however, this
    lateral error was larger than those in their earlier report (Zhang et al., 2013b).
    Rahman et al. (2017) developed a dynamic model to estimate the heading angle and
    reduce the harvesting time. They also devised an optimum harvesting area for convex
    and concave polygon-shaped fields using sensor measurement. The test results indicated
    that the absolute estimated heading angle was sufficient to apply to exact crop
    periphery determinations (Rahman, 2018). Choi et al. (2014) added a laser scanner
    (#UTM-30LX, Hokuyo USA, Indian Trail, NC) to the AV-8 combine harvester to provide
    a navigation system by obtaining more field information (such as the shape of
    the field). They did not use this sensor for obstacle detection or safety applications.
    Their findings in static and dynamic (speed: 0.97 m/s) conditions showed that
    the system had heading errors of 200 and 700 mm and lateral errors of 0.8° and
    3°, respectively. This system could distinguish the crop rows and harvested boundary
    precisely. In the manual operation of the system, the operator can detect the
    edge of harvester crops and tries to harvest the uncut crops. In the system''s
    autonomous operation, sensor detection was needed to detect the cut/uncut crops
    and to operate the system to reduce the uncut rows. In this regard, Teng et al.
    (2016) developed an edge detection system that uses a laser rangefinder that was
    a laser scanner (#UTM-30LX, Hokuyo) installed on a pan-tilt unit (PTU). The indoor
    edge detection tests showed an average offset of 217 mm and an RMSE of 6.7 mm.
    In static and dynamic experiments in a wheat field, the system had a lateral error
    of 42.7 and 101.5 mm, respectively. The accuracy of the edge detection in the
    dynamic condition was affected by the vehicle''s vibration, the steering error
    of the navigation (manually operated in that study), and the non-linearity of
    the wheat edges. Because of the low resolution of laser finder, the authors recommended
    the use of image processing or sensor fusion in future studies. Fan (2015) subsequently
    developed a real-time quality sensor to predict the protein and moisture of wheat
    using spectroscopy reflectance; however, this research was not directly related
    to the autonomous navigation (Choi et al., 2013). 3.1.9. AV-9 The monitoring of
    paddy field growth and spraying has been another common concern in Hokkaido (Roshanianfard).
    Liu and Noguchi (2016) developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) (AV-9) for
    paddy fields. They used a radio-controlled air propeller agricultural vessel (RB-26,
    Hokuto Yanmar Co., Ebetsu, Japan) as platform, a personal computer, a GNSS / GPS
    compass (V100: DGPS + gyroscope, Hemisphere GPS, Calgary, Canada), an ECU (Arduino
    UNO), servo motors for rudder control, and a magnetic sensor (#GV-101, Futaba,
    Mobara, Japan) to measure the rotary speed of the engine, and a wireless router
    for data communication (Fig. 21). They evaluated the performance of the USV in
    three different conditions: (1) line-follow navigation to minimize lateral and
    heading errors, (2) headland turning to evaluate the turning functions, and (3)
    map-based navigation. The developed robot USV showed linear and autonomous navigations
    with lateral errors of 250 and 380 mm, respectively. The USV was also able to
    navigate ellipses in turning paths. The large lateral errors were due to a crosswind,
    and Liu et al. (2017) tested an idea to simulate and reduce the effect of a crosswind.
    The main objective of their study was a determination of the USV''s maneuverability
    in paddy fields. The experimental results in a test of a zig-zag maneuver at 1.2
    m/s were compared with those of a computer simulation and related parameters.
    The simulation results indicated that the crosswind force can reach 2.85 N at
    the speed of 3 m/s under 0.1% turbulence. Liu et al. recommended that an optimized
    control algorithm that considers crosswind force be used in future studies (Liu
    et al., 2016). 3.1.10. AV-10 Rice cultivation in paddy fields presents specific
    challenges including maneuverability in the fields and labor concerns. Okamoto
    and his team have been working on the autonomous navigation of a specifically
    designed rice transplanter made by Kubota Co. (Japan) (Kawahito, 2016, Okada,
    2017, Wada, 2017). As shown in Fig. 21 (AV-10), this specifically designed vehicle
    has metallic wheels and unique dynamic characteristics that make it easier to
    control the vehicle. Okamoto et al. developed a low-cost navigation system that
    uses an RTK-GNSS sensor (#SPS 855, Trimble) and a CAN-Bus connection. This rice
    transplanter can maneuver in a paddy field with maximum and minimum lateral errors
    of 33.6 and 6.7 cm, respectively. Okamoto et al. later equipped the vehicle with
    a camera (4 mm, Tamron, Saitama, Japan) to recognize pre-provided paths. They
    observed that they could control the new system by an average lateral error of
    10.34 mm. This study is in progress. 3.1.11. AV-11 As mentioned, autonomous navigation
    includes the turning phase at the end of each straight maneuver (headland). To
    address this phase, several algorithms have been developed: a U-turn, keyhole
    turn (Takai et al., 2011), and fish-tail turn (Michio et al., 2001) algorithm.
    Wang and Noguchi (2016) designed a robot tractor (AV-11) with optimized maneuverability
    in straight lines and turning at the headland (Fig. 21). Their main objectives
    were the optimization of the trajectory, headland distance, and economy indexes.
    A wheel-type tractor (Model EG105, Yanmar) was equipped with a personal computer,
    control unit, RTK-GPS sensor (SPS855, Trimble), and IMU (#VN100, VectorNav Technology,
    Dallas, TX). Their vehicle''s turning function was named ''circle back (CB),''
    which includes two circular motions and one linear motion. Their experiments indicated
    that the robot tractor can maneuver with lateral and heading errors of 60 mm and
    1.2° respectively when the speed of the platform is 1.4 m/s. This turning algorithm
    provided efficient and optimized maneuvering. 3.1.12. AV-12 In a continuation
    of their research into follower robots such as a master-slave system (GoTo and
    FOLLOW systems) (Noguchi et al., 2004) and follower robot tractor (Zhang et al.,
    2014a, Zhang et al., 2013a, Zhang et al., 2015), Zhang and Noguchi (2015) developed
    a leader-follower system that is a collaboration of two independent robot tractors
    in the field, to reduce the total working time. They equipped a half-crawler tractor
    (Model EG453, Yanmar) with RTK-GPS (SPS855, Trimble), IMU (VN100, VectorNav),
    PDA (personal digital assistant), personal computer, and Bluetooth as the robot
    tractor (AV-12, Fig. 21). This system has two major parts: the robot''s navigator
    (all control functions) and the robot''s server/client. The system was first simulated
    on six paths at the average speed of 0.83 m/s when the distance between the robots
    was 12 m. The minimum distance between the safety zones was 1.56 m. The total
    operation time was 22.5 min. When the simulation results satisfied the safe distance
    criterion and the system was confirmed to work without collisions, Zhang and Noguchi
    tested the system in a field, using the same parameters as the simulation. The
    results indicated that the minimum distance between the safety zones was 0.8 m,
    and the total operation time was 24.5 min. These values were obtained because
    the software did not include all of the parameters of a real field, and due to
    IMU errors. Compared to a single robot tractor, the AV-12 system had 84.3% efficiency.
    The lateral errors of the first and second robot tractors were 70 and 50 mm, although
    the reported lateral error of the system was almost zero. Zhang et al. (2016)
    then improved the algorithm so that the minimum distance between the safety zones
    could be decreased to 0.59 m; the total operation time decreased to 20.4 min,
    and the efficiency increased to 95.1%. As was the case when the VeBots laboratory
    designed robot tractors with reasonable heading errors, this parameter was not
    reported in follower robots. The spark of the multi-robot operation idea was provided
    by Noguchi and Barawid (2011) for rice, wheat, a[109] for rice, wheat, and soybean
    in Japan, planning a five-year project beginning in 2010. They introduced developed
    autonomous vehicles (AV-2, AV-5, AV-6, AV-8, and AV-10) as platforms, RTK-GNSS
    and IMU as navigation sensors, and laser-scanner and ultrasonic sensors as safety
    sensors as the components of future multi-robotic systems. Their idea was the
    communication among a robot management system (navigation sensors, sensor fusion,
    Kalman filter), a real-time monitoring system (management and monitoring), a navigation
    system, and a safety system using a wireless local-area network (LAN). After several
    attempts, Zhang and Noguchi (2017) developed the first multi-robot tractor system
    for agricultural field work. They aimed to increase the efficiency and speed of
    farm work in order to decrease the risk of harvesting and other natural limitations
    such as rain and temperature variation. Their multi-robot system can decrease
    the economic indexes and labor costs that provide an infrastructure for high-efficiency
    agriculture. They used the robot tractor (AV-12) as the main platform in three
    different patterns: an I-pattern, a V-pattern, and a W-pattern using a U-shaped
    turning method. They controlled the lateral and longitudinal distances between
    the robots, and they defined a circular safety zone and a rectangular safety zone.
    They defined and evaluated two types of efficiency: the efficiency of the multi-robots''
    working time compared to that of a single robot, and the efficiency of multi-robots''
    working time compared to the total consumed time. As shown in Table 8, the I,
    V, and W patterns were simulated using three robot tractors (18 paths), five robot
    tractors (30 paths), and seven robot tractors (42 paths). The observed efficiency
    of these combinations were 268.4%, 365.6%, and 437.8%, respectively compared to
    a single robot tractor. The field experiments using three (V-pattern) and four
    (W-pattern) robot tractors showed efficiency values of 247.5% and 352.9%, respectively
    compared to a single robot tractor. Table 8. Details of the simulation and experimentation

    study''s comparison of working times indicated that the three-robot tractor and
    four-robot tractor combinations has efficiency and lateral error values of 80%
    and 82.1% and 50 and 42.5 mm, respectively. Based on the results of safety experiments,
    the developed system was confirmed to be safe for field performance. The final
    efficiency evaluation showed that the I-pattern, V-pattern, and W-pattern have
    83.2%–89.8%, 67.3%–78.9%, and 59.4%–65.8% ranges of efficiency, respectively (Fig.
    20), which are strongly dependent on the field size (Zhang, 2017). Download :

    patterns for multi-robot systems. 3.1.13. AV-13 Heavy-weight crops such as pumpkin,
    watermelon, melon, and cabbage have recently attained remarkable market value
    in Japan (especially Hokkaido), but the number of farmers in Japan continues to
    decrease because of the strenuous workloads and a labor shortage. For Japan as
    a developed country, farming is considered an overwhelming job compared to office
    work. The current harvesters are not precise or careful enough, and this can result
    in damage to crops and decline marketing value. Robot technology is a potential
    solution for these issues, but most of the agricultural robots that are currently
    available are designed for small-sized and lightweight crops (Roshanianfard).
    Vehicle robotics laboratories can design smart robot tractors for real farms,
    including farms with heavy crops. Such autonomous vehicles are equipped with different
    sensors (navigation sensors, safety sensors, and attitude sensors) and different
    platforms (tractors, combine harvesters, rice transplanter, airboats, and electric
    utility vehicles). As an intelligent system, a proportionate actuator is necessary
    as the complementary unit. This actuator could be applied for different applications.
    Roshanianfard and Noguchi (2017b) developed a ''harvesting robot for heavy-weight
    crops (HRHC)'' system (Roshanianfard, 2018a). They sought to develop an automatic
    harvesting system to improve the Japanese farmers'' work in different fields.
    The HRHC system consists of five main units: (1) an automatic robot tractor (which
    could be an AV-7, AV-11 or AV-12), (2) a 5-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm,
    (3) a specifically designed end-effector, (4) main controlling units, and (5)
    a vision system (Fig. 21, AV-13). Automatic maneuvers in the field, crop detection
    by a vision system, field monitoring, and precise field operations are only some
    of the planned applications for the HRHC system (Roshanianfard and Noguchi, 2017c).

    21. The configurations of the autonomous vehicles designed at Hokkaido University
    (Roshanianfard). To develop this system, Roshanianfard and Noguchi (2016) first
    designed the development procedure for a low-cost 5-DOF robotic arm for farm use,
    considering the limitations when facing complex agricultural conditions with a
    limited workspace and payload. Different parameters such as joint torque, payload
    per weight (PPW), and repeatability were calculated and simulated dynamically
    and statically. After the system''s development, the control algorithm Kamata
    et al. (2018) was created using the Denavit and Hartenberg method in forward kinematics
    and inverse kinematics calculations (Roshanianfard and Noguchi, 2018b). The performance
    evaluation of the system revealed that the workspace volume was 8.024 × 109 mm3,
    the front access was 3.518 × 106 mm2, and the harvesting area was 808 mm (Roshanianfard
    et al., 2019). Before the end-effector of the system was designed, three varieties
    of pumpkin (JEJEJ, TC2A, Hokutokou) as a heavy-weight crop were characterized
    (Roshanianfard, 2018a). Three experiments were conducted: (1) an evaluation of
    the general physical properties for investigating the pumpkins'' orientation and
    possible harvesting methodologies, (2) a compression strength test for measuring
    the yield force, and (3) a bending-shear test for measuring the yield force to
    cut the pumpkin stems. The results showed that the average pumpkin''s lift weight
    was 26% more than pumpkin''s pure weight. A special applied technique simplified
    the harvesting procedure (Roshanianfard and Noguchi, 2018a). Roshanianfard and
    Noguchi (2017a) then designed an end-effector with a unique harvesting methodology
    based on the extracted properties of pumpkins. The components were designed and
    dynamically simulated, and after several modifications, the final components were
    manufactured and assembled. The designed end-effector had five fingers designed
    to grasp and harvest heavy-weight crops with the diameter of 170–500 mm by a sustainable
    force distribution. The trial results demonstrated that the systems'' fingers
    have enough capability under the maximum payload of the HRHC system (i.e., 25
    kg), and the new end-effector could harvest the varieties of pumpkin mentioned
    above because the range of the system''s radius, volume and mass values covered
    the extracted physical parameters of pumpkins. After the control unit of the HRHC
    system was designed (based on a programmable logic controller system and consisting
    of a personal computer, a position board, amplifiers, servo motors, switching
    unit, and emergency switches), the performance of the HRHC system was evaluated.
    The results showed that the HRHC system has a 92% harvesting success rate, 0%
    damage rate, and an average cycle time of 42.4 s. The final parameters of workspace
    were as follows: workspace volume, 5.662 × 109 mm3; harvesting surface, 2.86 ×
    106 mm2; and harvesting length, 800 mm. The average accuracy values were as follows:
    x-direction, 10.91 mm; y-direction, 9.52 mm; and repeatability, 12.74 mm. The
    control resolution in the x-, y-, and z-directions were 1 ± 0.075, 1 ± 0.05, and
    1 ± 0.025, respectively (Roshanianfard et al., 2018). The harvesting success rate
    of the HRHC system (100%) was higher than the overall average harvesting success
    rate of previous studies 66% (40–86%) between 1984 and 2012 (Bac et al., 2014).
    The results of each calculation, simulation, development, modification, and characterization
    show that the HRHC system can be used for heavyweight crop robotic harvesting
    applications. Although this system was designed for specific crops (i.e., pumpkin,
    watermelon and cabbage), it could be used for other applications such as precise
    seeding, fertilizing, watering, and weeding. As Fig. 22 shows, the number of published
    papers in the developing era increased rapidly. During the next era of commercialization,
    the number of publications decreased because the highest priority was the expansion
    of the technology. Nowadays, the VeBots laboratory is focusing on upgrading their
    technology in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Table 9 presents more

    One of the main components of an autonomous vehicle is the mobile platform. For
    the category of autonomous agriculture vehicles, there are several platforms that
    can be used. The VeBots laboratory used mostly tractors (in nine projects and
    60 papers). They also used a combine harvester (one project, eight papers), a
    utility vehicle (one project, eight papers), an airboat (one project, four papers),
    and a rice transplanter (one project, one paper) (Fig. 23). In general, a tractor
    was the platform in 70% of the projects (74% of the papers), and the other types
    of platforms were used in only 30% of the projects and described in 26% of the
    papers. These data are not surprising, because the tractor is a multi-application
    vehicle that can carry different types of implements and equipment and perform
    several types of farm work; a tractor can thus be used for various robotic applications.

    Fig. 23. Different types of platforms used. Among the projects mentioned above,
    in seven projects (52 papers, 64.2%) a wheel-type transporter system was used;
    in three projects (14 papers, 17.3%) a half-crawler type was used, and in two
    projects (11 papers, 13.6%) a crawler transporter was used. Most of the robotic
    projects thus used a wheel-type tractor, which is the most commonly used agriculture
    machine in the world (Fig. 24). Download : Download high-res image (112KB) Download

    the development procedure of operation functions of AVs such as the steering control,
    forward and backward motion, brake, shift, rotary speed, hitch, and PTO. The advances
    in steering began with AV-1, the steering of which was controlled using a stepper
    motor connected to the steering shaft. An electro-hydraulic valve was used later
    in AV-2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -11, and -12. AV-5 and AV-8 each had a hydrostatic transmission
    (HST) system with which the steering could be controlled from a swash plate. The
    steering control of the AVs was not directly by the ECU until AV-13. This was
    because of Japan''s strict governmental policy regarding vehicle traffic and autonomous
    navigation of vehicles; this policy did not allow manufacturers to sell a vehicle
    with controllable steering. After 2016, the policy was revised and companies were
    allowed to offer controllable-steering vehicles. Before that, when an AV was being
    designed, some modification of the steering control was required. Table 10. Operation

    functions (i.e., forward and backward motion, brake, shift, rotary speed, hitch,
    and PTO control) were originally performed manually using the related handle.
    A handle connected to a switch could control the actuator. Until the AV-6, an
    extra ECU was required to control these functions. This ECU was connected between
    a switch and actuators and could control it using the signals received from a
    personal computer. This was why these functions need further modification. From
    the AV-7 onward, manufacturers have included a commercialized ECU on the platforms
    that makes the controllable functions possible. After that (with the exception
    of the AV-9, which has a different topology, control system, and platform), the
    operation functions of all AVs have been controllable without modification. 3.3.
    The development of communication system Fig. 25 illustrates the internal communication
    system development procedure. As shown, the internal communication system was
    directly controlled in the beginning because there was no ECU available on tractors.
    The research groups were obliged to use different interface cards to receive data
    from the sensors and to send commands to the actuators. Some prototype ECUs were
    eventually developed and installed on tractors. These ECUs were not commercialized
    at the time, but then researchers and manufacturers investigated several systems
    to obtain an ideal control unit. At that time, the RS-232c (and a USB in some
    cases) was used for communication between a personal computer and an ECU. In some
    systems, a USB was also used. After the ISO-Bus and the immediately CAN-Bus communication
    systems were developed, the communication of several ECUs became easier and faster.
    Tractors, like cars, can be equipped with CAN-Bus, and this communication method
    is now constantly used. Download : Download high-res image (41KB) Download : Download

    3.4. The development of positioning system For autonomous navigation, positioning
    sensors are known as the most important sensors because they can influence the
    accuracy of the entire autonomous system. When the AV-1 was developed, GNSS was
    not yet available, and its positioning sensor had been designed only for military
    applications. Image sensors were then created to guide a tractor (Fig. 26). As
    the accuracy of this positioning sensor was not good enough, researchers decided
    to use some available positioning sensors, including LNAV, XNAV, SNAV, and DGPS
    sensors. The SNAV sensor was selected as the optimal sensor because the navigation
    topology of SNAV is based on RTK-GPS. However, RTK-GPS and DGPS were still at
    the early development stages at the time, and their accuracy was not very high.
    RTK-GPS was also too expensive to use for agricultural applications (see Fig.
    27). Download : Download high-res image (123KB) Download : Download full-size

    high-res image (118KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 27. The attitude
    sensor development process. When Japan faced several challenges such as a labor
    shortage, the expensive price of autonomous vehicles became more acceptable and
    several laboratories expressed their interest in the development of robotic vehicles.
    During this period, RTK-GPS became the standard position sensor in autonomous
    vehicles. The current RTK-GPS, with 2-cm accuracy, is known as an accurate but
    expensive positioning sensor. The development of low-cost RTK-GPS or a new economic
    navigation method is necessary. 3.5. The development of attitude sensors Overall,
    attitude sensors can be divided into three categories: GDS, FOG, and IMU sensors.
    GDS sensors was the most commonly used sensors before developing FOG and IMU.
    GDS and TMS sensors, which are affected by the surrounding magnetic field, were
    unavoidably inaccurate which resulted in large random and bias errors. FOG sensors
    then became more popular, and three-axis FOG sensors were soon used to measure
    the 3D orientation of vehicles. These sensors were applied in airplane navigation
    systems before being used in the agriculture industry. Because of the three-axis
    FOG sensors'' high price, micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) IMUs were evaluated,
    and this type of attitude sensor is now frequently used. It thus seems that attitude
    sensors will continue to be used in future designs of autonomous agriculture vehicles.
    3.6. The development of safety sensors Fig. 28 illustrates the safety sensors
    on different AVs. Safety sensors — which protect an AV from various obstacles
    in agricultural environments — have changed over time. Contact sensors (e.g.,
    bumper switches) were used as the first safety sensors. This type of safety sensor
    has high reliability, but the large delay and long response time could cause serious
    damage. To increase the safety index, a camera was added to the next generation
    of AVs. Different methodologies based on the cameras were applied to analyze the
    agricultural environment, such as stereovision. A camera can collect valuable
    and diverse information about the environment, but this type of sensor had two
    significant disadvantages (1) more information can reduce the safety, and (2)
    environmental factors such as lights and shadows can give rise to errors. Researchers
    then started to combine a camera with a laser scanner to increase the safety level.

    Fig. 28. The safety sensor development process. The camera/laser scanner combination
    is now the main choice as a safety sensor, but the use of only a laser scanner
    has been examined. Compared to a camera, a laser scanner can cover a longer distance,
    and, in most cases, a laser scanner is more accurate. The development of safety
    sensors began with switches, moved on to cameras, and eventually to the combination
    of a laser scanner and camera as the most effective sensor. Agricultural environments
    have been the main substrates examined in the development of AVs for farming,
    which has provided many challenges in the design of robotic systems. This type
    of substrate is special because in an agriculture environment, many complex and
    varying factors must be considered. Examples include light reflection, which can
    affect image sensors; dusty environments, which can affect a mechanical platform
    or its components; and humidity, rain, wind, non-flat surfaces, isolation, and
    vibration. All of these factors increase the complexity of the design process,
    and this complexity it is the reason why researchers select a specific environment
    when they start to design the required system. As shown in Fig. 29, the VeBots
    laboratory at Hokkaido University has conducted research in three main environments:
    agricultural fields, an orchard, and a paddy field. Most of the research was performed
    in agricultural fields (87% of all experiments); the orchards and paddy field
    accounted for only 14%. The agricultural field experiments used different platforms
    (e.g., a tractor, combine harvester, or utility vehicle). The orchard experiments
    used only a tractor, and the single paddy field experiment used both a rice transplanter
    and an airboat. Download : Download high-res image (82KB) Download : Download

    Fig. 30 illustrates the heading error of each of the 13 AVs and their travel speeds.
    The horizontal axis indicates the different experiments, e.g., AV-2, PS-9, 0.8,
    and Bumpy, along with the positioning sensor used (PS-9: RTK-GPS, Topcon, Legacy-E;
    see Table 3), the travel speed (0.8 m/s), and the environment specifications (e.g.,
    Bumpy field). The blue vertical line indicates the threshold of the attitude sensor.
    This threshold is located between the AV-2 and the AV-3, when the attitude sensor
    was changed from GDS to IMU (three-axis FOG or MEMS). These data establish that
    the IMUs had a revolutionary effect on the heading error. Before the AV-3, GDSs
    were used in the AV-1 and AV-2 as the attitude sensor. Download : Download high-res
    image (552KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 30. Performance indicators
    of the AVs (heading error). As is clear in the figure, the heading error in (AV-2,
    PS-5, 0.55), (AV-2, PS-5, 0.6), (AV-2, PS-5, 0.64), (AV-2, PS-9, 0.8, Flat), and
    (AV-2, PS-9, 0.8, Slope) were 3.11°, 3.02°, 3.48°, 4.39°, and 3.15°, respectively
    (Fig. 30 (1)). These errors were quite high and were not suitable for autonomous
    applications. In standard experimental conditions, the heading error has always
    been < 2°. From AV-3 onward, three-axis FOGs began to be used, and this type of
    IMU changed over time to the MEMS type. Some experiments indicated that high speed
    (Fig. 30 (3)), a rapid turn (Fig. 30 (4)), and using only a 2D laser scanner as
    the positioning sensor (Fig. 30 (2)) can cause large heading errors. Generally,
    the average heading errors before (using GDS) and after (using IMU) the threshold
    were 2° and 1.6°. Using an IMU thus has a positive effect on the heading error
    in navigation. The next performance indicator of AVs is the lateral error (Fig.
    31), which is directly related to the positioning sensor and also related to the
    platform, the transporter system, the tire slip angle, and the environmental conditions.
    The horizontal axis in Fig. 31 indicates the number of autonomous vehicles, the
    positioning sensors, the travel speed, and environmental specifications. The figure
    is divided into two periods using a threshold between AV-1 and AV-2. The threshold
    is the time point at which the positioning sensor changed to RTK-GPS. Before that,
    different positioning sensors (e.g., image sensor, LNAV, SNAV, XNAV, and DGPS)
    were used, and the results were not stable over all different conditions. The
    lateral error of the AV-1 was 23 cm — a large error due to the image sensor and
    stations. Download : Download high-res image (534KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 31. Performance indicators of the AVs (lateral error). In the first
    AV-2 projects, positioning sensors such as LNAV, SNAV, and XNAV were used, with
    poor results. When the positioning sensor was changed to RTK-GPS, the average
    lateral error decreased to 6.78 cm. The RTK-GPS, Topcon, and Legacy-E positioning
    sensors together had an average lateral error of 2.5 cm when attached to the AV-5
    and AV-7. The RTK-GPS, Topcon, and AGI-3 positioning sensors together had an average
    lateral error of 2.61 cm when attached to AV-5, -7, -8, and -11. The RTK-GPS,
    Trimble, and SPS855 sensors had an average lateral error of 6 cm when attached
    on the AV-7 and AV-12. The RTK-GPS, Trimble, and MS750 sensors had an average
    lateral error of 9.83 cm when attached to the AV-2, -3, -6, and -8. The DGPS,
    Hemisphere, and V100 sensors had an average lateral error of 11 cm when attached
    to the AV-2 and the AV-9 (31 cm). Although it has not been possible to determine
    the lateral error by considering only the positioning sensors, the positioning
    sensors play the main role in attaining high position accuracy. The data in Fig.
    31 also indicate that high speed (AV-6) and a wet environment such as a paddy
    field (AV-9) can dramatically increase the lateral error. 4. Lessons learned Almost
    thirty years of study on the agricultural autonomous vehicles in the laboratory
    of vehicle robotics – Hokkaido University – Japan has yielded valuable experiences,
    the most important of which are outlined below (see videos at Roshanianfard (2020)):
    1. To develop an autonomous vehicle (for various applications including agriculture
    industry) with minimum human interposition, the selected platform (such as tractor,
    combine harvester, Utility vehicle, Transplanter) must have an automatic transmission
    and an electrical controllable steering system. An automatic transmission helps
    to adjust the vehicle''s maneuver velocity by sending a command through the TECU.
    Speed control of platforms that have manual transmission should be done with additional
    mechanical/hydraulic actuating systems (to change gears and control clutch control).
    It is not recommended to use additional actuators because their installation has
    many challenges and their application includes many errors. 2. The steering control
    is also an important character that should be considered based on the national
    policies of each country. Many developed countries such as Germany and Japan,
    have restricted the use of electronic steering on various vehicles because of
    safety reasons. After designing the necessary standards and regulations, this
    system is gradually seen on the new designs and platforms such as Yanmar YT5113
    (Tractor). In some other countries, there may be similar policies that restrict
    the development of autonomous vehicles. Designers and researchers must carefully
    review the related standards and rules before starting their project to avoid
    wasting time and budget. 3. To control all the components of an AAV, there must
    be sufficient access to the ECU using USB, RS232c, or CAN-BUS. This is because,
    controlling a platform through its ECU helps the automation process to control
    the components according to the factory''s designed standards and applied APIs.
    This requires that the manufacturing company either allow to access the contents
    of the ECU or to develop an external port to communicate the ECU and provide the
    related controlling API. Otherwise, the designer should include a separate ECU
    for autonomous control. An external ECU may have various challenges such as (1)
    inconsistency of the controlling commands of external ECU versus the main ECU,
    (2) lack of equipment equipped with CAN-BUS communication system, (3) multi-ECU
    control challenges using USB or RS232c communication system, and (4) inability
    to stop the device when it gets out of control. 4. Each prototype AAV needs to
    be equipped with a computer that receives the commands from sensors (such as RTK-GPS,
    IMU, LIDAR) and send the related commands to the actuators (such as steering and
    brake) using a related algorithm. It is strongly recommended to use solid-state
    drive (SSD) hard disks to store data inside the computer so that the vibrations
    of the vehicles during maneuver have less effect on the performance of the algorithm.
    This type of hard disks is more resistant to physical shock and can support fast
    communication with ECUs. 5. The GNSS-based navigation systems have weak performance
    in covered areas such as tunnels or environments with obstacles trees or buildings.
    It is important to consider this disadvantage in designed algorithms. There are
    many studies introduced in this study that have developed different algorithms
    using sensor fusion, LRF, or other methods. 6. However, the fuzzy logic, genetic
    algorithm, and artificial neural network can help to solve the non-linear behavior
    of algorithms and support MIMO controls, it is recommended to develop the controlling
    algorithms as simple as possible regardless of the least important parameters.
    A simple algorithm can be run fast, and its troubleshooting and coding are much
    easier. In this regard, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and model predictive
    control (MPC) controllers recommended. 7. More detailed information about the
    characterization of different components including hardware, environments, controlling
    algorithm, and performance indicator described in detail in Section 2. It is recommended
    to study this section before developing a new AV. 5. Conclusion Different aspects
    of autonomous agricultural vehicles have been presented in detail: the variation
    in hardware (development, platform, transportation system, operation function,
    communication methods, sensors, and control units), the environment, control algorithms,
    and performance indicators. The development procedures and characteristics of
    each AV were compared and discussed. Case studies of autonomous vehicles designed
    at Hokkaido University and the development process were presented as practical
    cases and representative development challenges. The case studies also contribute
    to researchers'' understanding of the aspects of future robotic systems and to
    the prevention of repeat failures and unnecessary challenges. It is hoped that
    this review will assist scientists who are working to develop robots for the benefit
    of humanity and a peaceful future. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

  description: Indian agriculture is undergoing transformation due to technological
    revolution, sprawling urbanization, modern cultivation techniques, and climate
    change. These changes offer unique challenges and opportunities to transform agriculture
    to smart, more productive, economically remunerative, socially equitable and environmentally
    sustainable through adoption of smart mechanization technologies. In this paper,
    the approaches and strategies are highlighted for sustainable mechanization of
    Indian agriculture. The smart farm mechanization includes application of sensors,
    controllers, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.
    The research work in the areas of precision agriculture, digital farming, precision
    irrigation, AI powered machinery, user friendly mobile applications, etc. has
    gained momentum in India during the last decade. The emerging smart agriculture
    mechanization combines precision farm with management tools (GPS/GNSS, DSS, VRT),
    end user ap plications (platforms, mobile, machines, Agri-bots), data solutions
    (data IoT, information, tech empowered tools), etc. These technologies not only
    make farm machinery smart and efficient but also help in saving inputs such as
    seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, water and energy for sustainable agriculture.

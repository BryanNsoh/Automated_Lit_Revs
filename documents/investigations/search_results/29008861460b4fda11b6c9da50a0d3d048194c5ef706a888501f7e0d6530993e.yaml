    Big Data applications have the potential to help agricultural industries meet
    productivity and sustainability challenges. However, these benefits are unlikely
    to be realised if the social implications of these technological innovations are
    not adequately considered by those who promote them. Big Data applications are
    intrinsically socio-technical; their development and deployment are a product
    of social interactions between people, institutional and regulatory settings,
    as well as the technology itself. This paper explores the socio-technical factors
    and conditions that influence the development of Smart Farming and Big Data applications,
    using a multi-level perspective on transitions combined with social practice theory.
    We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 Australian grain farmers and industry
    stakeholders to elicit their perspectives on benefits and risks of these changes.
    The analysis shows that issues related to trust are central concerns for many
    participants. These include procedural concerns about transparency and distributional
    concerns about who will benefit from access to and use of “farmers’ data”. These
    concerns create scepticism about the value of ‘smart’ technologies amongst some
    industry stakeholders, especially farmers. It also points to a divergence of expectations
    and norms between actors and institutions at the regime and niche levels in the
    emerging transition towards Smart Farming. Bridging this divide will require niche
    level interventions to enhance the agency of farmers and their local networks
    in these transactions, and, the cooperative design of new institutions at regime
    level to facilitate the fair and transparent allocation of risk and benefit in
    farming data information chains. Keywords: Multi-level perspectiveSocio-technical

    1 Introduction Advances in Smart Farming (also known as digital farming or digital
    agriculture) and Big Data applications have the potential to deliver a range of
    benefits, such as improved decision-making, increased efficiency and economic
    gain and even decreased environmental impact, which could in turn help agricultural
    industries meet their productivity and sustainability challenges ( Sonka, 2016;
    Everingham et al., 2016; Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming takes advantage
    of emerging smart machines, sensors and precision agriculture equipment that create
    vast amounts of real-time farm data (e.g. monitoring animals, soil, water and
    plants) and uses this data to make more timely or accurate decisions, both on-farm
    and across the supply chain ( Wolfert et al., 2017; Eastwood et al., 2017). Big
    Data refers to the capability to extract information and insights at a large scale
    where previously it was economically and technically not possible ( Sonka, 2015),
    through the use of “computerised analytical systems that interrogate extremely
    large databases of information in order to identify particular trends and correlations”
    ( Keogh and Henry, 2016: 4). Big Data is often described in terms of the 3 Vs:
    Volume; Velocity; and Variety ( Manyika et al., 2011; Kitchin and McArdle, 2016).
    Big Data applications are already being deployed to improve productivity and profitability
    in many sectors ( van Rijmenam, 2017; Davenport and Dyché, 2013; Kitchin and Data,
    2014). Early experiences with Big Data applications in agriculture suggest that
    their success hinges upon multiple social and technical factors, including the
    willingness of stakeholders to share and integrate data, end-user acceptance of
    the technologies, and the existence of protocols for protecting farmers’ rights
    to privacy, data ownership and control ( Sonka, 2015; Eastwood and Yule, 2015;
    Griffith et al., 2013; Kaloxylos et al., 2014; Poppe et al., 2015). Furthermore,
    Big Data applications have the potential to transform roles and power relationships
    between stakeholders within the agricultural sector ( Wolfert et al., 2017; Bronson
    and Knezevic, 2016). Table A1 Final coding structure. Download CSVDisplay Table
    Consequently, Big Data applications are socio-technical configurations, their
    development and deployment being a product of social interactions between people,
    institutional and regulatory settings, as well as the technology itself ( Vines
    et al., 2013). In this respect, Big Data applications are similar to other agri-environmental
    decision-support technologies, or farming practices more broadly, that rely upon
    stakeholder collaboration ( Carberry et al., 2002; Jakku and Thorburn, 2010) and
    trusted local networks and intermediaries that buffer farmers’ perceived risks
    and enhance local benefits ( Taylor and Van Grieken, 2015). These dynamics occur
    within and across nested levels of social, institutional and cultural organisations
    that are tied to processes of innovation and transitions in society. To address
    what we argue is presently an empirical gap in understanding these emerging dynamics
    as they relate to digital disruption in Australian farming, we employ a multi-level
    perspective on transitions in the Australian grains industry, combined with social
    practice theory to further explore social responses to smart farming technologies.
    The aim of our research is to explore the socio-technical factors that influenced
    stakeholder expectations about Big Data applications. Our key overarching research
    questions were: (i) what are the socio-technical conditions that assist the effective
    and acceptable use of digital agriculture and Big Data applications; and (ii)
    how might these technologies enhance or disrupt existing social and economic relationships
    in the agriculture sector? We examined the socio-technical factors that influence
    the impacts of Big Data applications at multiple levels, from the micro (the farmer
    and the technology developer) to the meso and macro (regulatory settings and institutional
    arrangements). 2 Two perspectives on understanding change: multi-level perspective
    on socio-technical transitions (MLP) and social practice theory This research
    draws on the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP) ( Geels,
    2002, 2012; Schot and Geels, 2008; Geels, 2004), combined with social practice
    theory ( Hinrichs, 2014; Shove and Walker, 2010; Ingram, 2015) to inform our analysis
    of stakeholder expectations of Big Data applications. The MLP approach was designed
    to provide “analytical and heuristic concepts to understand the complex dynamics
    of sociotechnical change” ( Geels, 2002: 1259), making it a useful framework for
    understanding socio-technical factors related to emerging technologies. The MLP
    approach identifies three nested hierarchical levels of a socio-technical system:
    niche innovations (micro level); regimes (meso level) and landscapes (macro level),
    as illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Multiple levels (niches, regime, landscape) of
    a socio-technical system form a nested hierarchy ( Nykvist and Whitmarsh 2008:
    1375, adapted from Geels, 2002). Display full size The socio-technical landscape
    represents the overarching level. It represents the wider context of macro, long-term
    economic, political, cultural and environmental trends and material context (e.g.
    physical infrastructure, population growth, economic development, resource availability,
    political ideologies and dynamics, societal values, climate change) ( Geels, 2002,
    2004). The socio-technical regime level refers to the dominant and relatively
    stable systems of interacting practices, social structures and institutional elements
    (e.g. cognitive routines, shared belief systems and expectations, as well as normative,
    regulative and formal rules) that shape the activities of relevant actor groups
    ( Geels, 2002, 2004). Micro-level niches are protected spaces (e.g. R&D laboratories,
    demonstration sites) where radical novelties (innovations) are generated, incubated
    and developed. The MLP approach includes a focus on socio-technical transitions,
    defined as major shifts in structures, cultures and practices such that the way
    societal functions are fulfilled is profoundly altered ( Geels, 2002; Ingram,
    2015). The MLP has been applied to a variety of contexts, including agro-ecological
    innovations ( Wigboldus et al., 2016), algae blooms ( Diaz et al., 2013), low-carbon
    transitions ( Geels, 2012), transport systems ( Nykvist and Whitmarsh, 2008),
    the UK Carbon Trust ( Kern, 2012) and urban water systems ( Quezada et al., 2016).
    As illustrated in Fig. 2, the central notion of the MLP approach to socio-technical
    transitions is that these are non-linear, co-evolutionary processes that result
    from the interplay of multiple developments across these three analytical levels:
    “(a) niche innovations build up internal momentum, (b) changes at the landscape
    level create pressure on the regime, (c) destabilisation of the regime creates
    windows of opportunity for niche innovations” ( Schot and Geels, 2008: 545). The
    MLP approach therefore helps make sense of the complex socio-technical dynamics
    and processes that must align in order for novel technologies to successfully
    disrupt the existing regime. For the purposes of this study we approximate digital
    technology related experimentation and uptake on individual farms or local, place-based
    networks of farms, as the empirical site of an emerging innovation niche. However,
    similar to Ingram (2015) in relation to the importance of niche-regime interactions,
    we recognise that there are multiple actors engaged with farmers through supply
    and information chains (e.g. scientists, advisors, retailers, cooperatives, industry
    organisations etc.) and that, in our conceptualisation, these actors directly
    and indirectly connect these innovation niches with regime-level structures and
    norms, situated within the broader socio-technical landscape. Fig. 2 Multi-level
    perspective on socio-technical transitions ( Schot and Geels, 2008: 546). Display
    full size Despite its utility, there has been constructive discussion in the literature
    on some of the limitations of MLP in examining the social dimensions of those
    transitions ( Hinrichs, 2014; Shove and Walker, 2010; Ingram, 2015; Wigboldus
    et al., 2016; Raven et al., 2011). Hinrichs, (2014) in particular, in exploring
    transitions to sustainability in food systems, has argued that social practice
    theory can complement a multi-level perspective, and when used together can improve
    our analytical and explanatory purchase on food systems change. Social practice
    theory is a type of cultural theory that draws on the work of Bourdieu (1977,
    1990); Giddens (1984); Heidegger (1962) and Wittgenstein (see Schatzki, 1996)
    to explore how social structures and individual agency interact (for a comprehensive
    review see Reckwitz, (2002). While there is no unified approach within social
    practice theory ( Schatzki, 2001), there is a common focus on understanding social
    life through the everyday and routine performance of social practices ( Hargreaves,
    2011; Spaargaren, 2011), including, for example, agriculture. Reckwitz (2002:
    249) defines a practice as ‘a routinized type of behaviour’ made up of several
    interconnected elements, including both physical and mental activities, ‘things’
    and their use, background knowledge and know-how and emotions and motivations.
    Thus, a practice is a ‘rountinized way in which bodies are moved, objects are
    handled, subjects are treated, things are described and the world is understood’
    ( Reckwitz, 2002: 250). Shove and colleagues ( Shove et al., 2012: 14) provide
    a useful account of three elements that make up practices, namely: (i) materials,
    including things, technologies, physical entities and objects; (ii) competences,
    including skills, know-how and techniques; and (iii) meanings, including symbolic
    meanings, images, ideas and aspirations. The connections between these elements
    shape the way in which practices emerge, remain, change and disappear ( Shove
    et al., 2012). Previous work by Hargreaves (2011) has found these connections
    to create subtle but influential shifts in the performance of working practices
    and the interactions and identities that sustain those practices. Similarly, Spaargaren
    (2011) argues that social practice theory provides new and useful ways of understanding
    issues of agency, technology and culture, which can inform environmental governance
    around sustainable consumption. Thus, social practice theory provides a valuable
    lens for understanding stability and change, including ways in which practices
    are established, reproduced or broken across space and time ( Hargreaves 2011;
    Shove et al., 2012). Indeed recent scholarship has examined the ways in which
    smart farming technologies are accommodated within and modify the everyday lives,
    practices and identities of farmers ( Carolan, 2016; Higgins et al., 2017). Following
    Hinrichs (2014: 143) we use social practice theory to recognise the importance
    and influence of “normal everyday routines and practices”, the “possibilities
    of shifting these (or not)” and their relationship to politics, governance, values
    and ethics. That is, we focus on those social and institutional factors that influence
    uptake and outcomes associated with technology. These include actors’ experiences
    with and perceptions of the risks and benefits of the technology and the extent
    to which the technology is seen to be compatible with existing farming or industry
    practices, routines and relationships ( Rogers, 1995; Pannell et al., 2006; Vanclay
    and Lawrence, 1994). 3 Methodology Our research adopted a broadly interpretivist,
    qualitative approach, following a social constructivist grounded theory strategy
    for analysis, informed by sensitising concepts described above from MLP and social
    practice theory ( Charmaz, 2006). This allowed us to identify and explore different
    perceptions of, and experiences with Smart Farming and Big Data applications in
    the Australian grains industry. Through in-depth interviews with diverse public,
    private and non-government organisations in the grain farming industry, as well
    as addressing our overarching research questions we specifically sought to elicit:
    (i) Multiple contexts of use of the technologies, e.g. how do Big Data applications
    integrate (or not) with existing practices and emerging trends in the agricultural
    sector? This question informs our first research question: what are the socio-technical
    conditions that assist the effective and acceptable use of digital agriculture
    and Big Data applications? (ii) Characteristics of the multiple stakeholders and
    end users and multiple technologies, e.g. how do different stakeholders understand
    Big Data applications and their associated risks and benefits? This question informs
    our second research question: how might these technologies enhance or disrupt
    existing social and economic relationships in the agriculture sector? Since the
    applications of Big Data are likely to vary across different agricultural sectors,
    we chose to focus on one of Australia’s largest agricultural industries where
    Big Data applications are emerging, namely, the grains sector. The grains sector
    makes an important contribution to the Australian economy, with the production
    of grains, oilseeds and pulse crops accounting for around 23 per cent ($13 billion)
    of the total gross value of farm production and around 24 per cent of the total
    value of farm export income in 2015–16 ( ABARES, 2017). Grain production (predominantly
    wheat) occurs across a wide range of distinct agroecological zones, each with
    different climate and soil characteristics ( Guthrie et al., 2017). Family farm
    ownership continues to dominate Australian grain production with more than 95%
    of grain farms being family owned and operated ( Kalisch Gordon, 2016). The Australian
    grains sector is an example of an industry that has had to embrace niche innovation
    at the farm level in the past in order for farms to remain viable in an unprotected
    market and to mitigate the risk of significant climatic variability. Innovation
    examples include the uptake of no-till farming, GPS technologies for auto-steer
    and, more recently, modest rates of adoption of precision agriculture approaches,
    such as variable rate fertiliser application ( Robertson et al., 2012). Practices
    can change rapidly in order for grain farmers to remain competitive and as such
    it provides an interesting case study industry with a history of niche innovations
    taking off. Examples of smart farming platforms in the Australian grains industry
    include ProductionWise ( GrainGrowers, 2018), YieldProphet ( BCG, 2017), Graincast
    ( CSIRO, 2018) and Smart Farmer ( Elders, 2018). 1 With the help of subject matter
    experts known to the researchers, we identified the key stakeholders in the grains
    industry. We selected interviewees using a purposive sampling approach ( Patton,
    1990), collaborating with key informants to identify and recruit participants
    from different sectors within the grains industry and with different levels of
    involvement with digital technologies. Participants were invited via email and
    a follow-up phone-call. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 grains
    industry participants (23 men and 3 women): 14 participants were from the dryland
    broad acre and mixed farming systems of the Wimmera-Mallee region (in the southern
    state of Victoria), providing regional level grains sector insights; and 12 participants
    represented a cross-section of other industry stakeholders from the state and
    national level (see Table 1; see also ( Jakku et al., 2016); Ethics clearance
    #070/15). The Wimmera-Mallee region was selected because the region is engaged
    in active discussions about the future of digital agriculture. At the time of
    the interviews a key local grower group with a strong innovation record – the
    Birchip Cropping Group, a farmer-led agricultural research and extension organisation
    – was exploring opportunities for setting up a data co-operative, while the local
    council was developing a digital futures strategy. In the Wimmera-Mallee Region
    there is approximately 3 million hectares of dryland cropping and livestock country
    predominately cropped (approximately 75%). There are approximately 4000 family
    farms in the region and they make up the vast majority of landholders. Farm size
    ranges from very small (under 200 ha) to over 5000 ha, with some up to 10000 ha.
    The Birchip Cropping Group has 430 family farms as members, farming approximately
    1 million hectares. A typical membership consists of two family units farming
    the land together. Often both families will have children back on the farm or
    expecting to be back on the farm shortly. Farm size is mostly commonly between
    2000 to 4000 ha. Table 1 Interview participants by stakeholder category. Download
    CSVDisplay Table Interviews were generally one hour in duration and nine were
    conducted face-to-face in the Wimmera-Mallee region in February 2016, while the
    remaining 17 interviews were conducted via telephone between January – March 2016.
    The interviews started by covering some background information on individual participants.
    This was followed by questions about their place within the grains industry supply
    chain and their views on information flows and relationships among key players.
    Next, the interviews explored perceptions of digital agriculture and Big Data,
    prompted by the following questions: (i) what does Big Data and digital agriculture
    mean to you?; (ii) how much is Big Data part of your current business or future
    strategy?; (iii) what benefits or opportunities do these digital technologies
    and Big Data applications provide?; and (iv) what problems or risks do they present?
    The final section explored ideas about how these risks might be managed or reduced
    and some final reflections on the future of digital technologies and Big Data
    in the grains industry. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. We
    used the qualitative data analysis software QSR NVivo® (QSR International, version
    10) to aid the coding, analysis and management of the data. Interview transcripts
    were analysed using a mixture of deductive and inductive coding followed by iterative
    thematic analysis ( Grbich, 2007). This means that our research questions and
    understanding of social practice theory and MLP guided us in determining what
    codes might be relevant, which were then adapted and shaped from what was actually
    found in the data. The result is a hierarchical structure of themes, sub-themes
    and nodes through multiple rounds of coding, informed by (and informing) our theoretical
    perspectives (see appendix for the final coding structure). In the results section
    that follows we explore key themes that emerged in the interviews regarding stakeholder
    perspectives on the benefits and risks of these smart farming technologies. Then
    in the discussion we return to the two theoretical perspectives – the MLP approach
    and social practice theory – to extract key interpretive insights that these complementary
    perspectives offer. 4 Results 4.1 Stakeholder perspectives on the benefits of
    smart farming and Big Data The grains industry stakeholders that we interviewed
    identified a range of benefits and risks associated with smart farming and Big
    Data, as summarised in Table 2. Table 2 Summary of results on perceived benefits
    and risks of smart farming and Big Data applications. Download CSVDisplay Table
    4.1.1 On-farm benefits On-farm benefits were the most frequently mentioned type
    of benefits associated with emerging Big Data applications. Interviewees outlined
    a range of ways in which Big Data could improve farm management and decision-making,
    focusing on improved efficiencies through more targeted applications of on-farm
    inputs: Well, benefits are more targeted application of inputs across our farms,
    so if we have the data to be able to aid in decision making then we can match
    our inputs to the potentials of the season. Not only on a paddock scale but down
    to a pixel scale or a particular point on the farm. (Grower group 8) A related
    theme was the increased productivity and profitability that improved farm management
    and decision-making could bring: “…farmers make lots of decisions through the
    life of their crop on a farm, and if they can make better decisions…they are able
    to improve their efficiency and productivity out of that” (Input provider 3).
    The value of real-time information for decision-making was also highlighted as
    a potential benefit associated with advances in digital agriculture, especially
    sensing technologies: “So having a system - it might only be one or two weather
    stations on a property - that feeds in almost real time data to the farmer; would
    be really useful” (Grower group 6). Future benefits of Big Data were expected
    from linking-up current or future data sets, such as soils, climate projections,
    weather forecasts, water models and crop information on an individual farm basis.
    Several participants expressed views that the efficiencies enabled by Big Data
    would mean higher prices for growers at the farm gate, although this view was
    not always supported by growers themselves: So digital agriculture, for me, is
    the automation of a lot of management processes for farmers largely, I don’t think
    that you could necessarily automate much more of the supply chain. So it…is the
    next productivity gain pre-farm gate, it means that growers more take a role of
    managing their farm and putting prescriptions in place to automate those processes,
    [such as] a sprayer going out and spraying without a human actually sitting in
    it… (Grower group 4) 4.1.2 Industry and supply chain benefits Interviewees also
    identified a number of potential industry and supply chain benefits, particularly
    those related to optimisation along the supply chain and the improved industry-level
    decision-making that this could bring: “I think, the supply chain will streamline
    itself and will be able to drive efficiencies from the use of Big Data, so there’ll
    be a commercial benefit for the business” (Grower group 4). Another important
    benefit associated with Big Data was improved predictive and analytical capabilities
    for storage and transport logistics providers: “Certainly through logistics…being
    able to track, maintain, record is important for supply chain optimisation. …So
    at every level it will drive improved performance” (Grower group 3). More accurate
    tracking and predictions of yield would allow for better optimisation of decisions
    and resource allocation related to transport, logistics, labour, timing and price
    points ( Sonka, 2016). One interviewee referred to this as visibility along the
    supply chain where there may have been unknowns before, such as when grain was
    transported or combined with other growers’ grain: The marketers want to keep
    data separate to get commercial advantage whereas [from a logistics and handlers’
    supply chain perspective]…greater visibility and accuracy around that data is
    what we’re chasing. (Logistics and trading 2) Big Data applications could also
    increase the traceability of grain in the supply chain, creating value for consumers,
    retailers and processors as well as growers: Traceability is the one that everyone
    talks about, so traceability is a good example because we’re seeing increasing
    demand for people who understand where their food came from. The digital technology
    will enable that. (Input provider 1) Similarly, one grower described how information
    on varieties of grain (including GM varieties, provenance, quality) could now
    be traced by customers, creating premium products and niche markets with potential
    to grow demand for specialist products (e.g. grain for craft brewing). Improved
    crop forecasting data was reported as another potential future benefit of Big
    Data. Interviewees noted that the ability to gather and analyse data on variety,
    quantity, location, quality, weather events, management decisions and market prices
    offers a whole new way of understanding the grains industry. However, support
    will be required to improve the capacity to interpret the data in order to answer
    specific questions, for example to compare years and management decisions, as
    well as to look at non-traditional indicators to open new market niches. Bulk
    handlers described the potential for value generation from collaboration between
    companies involved in grain storage and transport. One handler described the benefits
    of data-driven predictive modelling of the location, timing, volumes and quality
    of grain yields for informing decisions on rolling stock and road transport. The
    efficiency of the system overall, including managing grain flows into the port
    terminals, could be improved by co-investment across grain handling companies
    in a given region in generating a ‘complete’ picture of where and when grain was
    moving. However, investment in such a system by one company alone was seen as
    unviable and therefore improved collaboration across supply chains would be necessary
    to fully realise the potential benefits of Big Data applications. 4.2 Stakeholder
    perspectives on the risks associated with smart farming and Big Data Despite the
    potential benefits of Big Data applications, interviewees identified a range of
    concerns about these emerging technologies, from technical concerns about the
    technologies to broader concerns about the social and institutional context within
    which these new technologies are operating. 4.2.1 Data accuracy, reliability and
    capabilities One common theme that emerged was that Big Data applications are
    novel and immature technologies. The ‘teething problems ‘often associated with
    new technologies, combined with concerns about data accuracy, made people wary
    about the reliability of emerging Big Data applications: But given this is…a relatively
    new field, it is going to take some time to get that validation and to get the
    systems working at a high level of accuracy. So that’s, I think, one of the challenges
    over time that farmers are going to need to be able to work with systems that
    might not be perfect, but as they work with them, they will get better. (Input
    provider 3) A related concern here was the challenges of data storage and handling
    in the context of a new and emerging technology: So we’ve got a lot of data that
    we’ve been collecting. And where we can use it, we do. But we really haven’t found
    an easy outlet for that. And I think that’s one of the things that the Big Data
    problem’s created. There’s just lots of information, which we know we need to
    collect to be able to get enough to be useful, but we don’t know what to do with
    it and we should have enough by now to be useful. (Grower 3) The transferability
    and applicability of the new technologies were another related area of concern,
    including the difficulty of making judgments about competing technologies in this
    domain: …there’s at least half a dozen companies [in the United States] offering
    precision, prescription farming services for farmers to deal with, typically nitrogen
    in corn. …So those sorts of services are going to come here eventually, and how
    does a farmer evaluate whether the Pioneer solution is better than the Monsanto
    solution…? (Grower 1) Interviewees also noted that data within the current Australian
    agricultural system is highly fragmented and people are not currently maximising
    existing data. A related issue here is the challenge of interoperability (the
    ability of information technology systems to exchange and make use of information),
    which is compounded by the fragmented nature of Australia’s digital agriculture
    data landscape: …it’s like different railway systems. In the end, it’s sometimes
    easier to do it your own way than find a compromise. And I think that goes back
    to trust and everything like that. It’s how much are you willing to give up and
    how much are you willing to drive forward? (Research & consulting 3) Furthermore,
    it takes new skills and capabilities to properly apply and interpret the results
    of Big Data systems and analysis, as identified by this grower: It will change
    the skills, over time, required to be a successful farmer. (Grower 1) 4.2.2 Digital
    infrastructure The fundamental limitations of Australia’s digital infrastructure,
    especially in rural and regional areas, was one of the most significant barriers
    to the success of Big Data applications identified by interviewees. There were
    widespread views amongst interviewees that the mobile phone network and internet
    access in rural Australia was not currently sufficient to support some of the
    potential advances in Smart Farming: …another risk is actually not having the
    ability to download all this data and actually upload stuff and have good internet
    coverage. …If we want this to happen in the country we''ve got to have our mobile
    phone working pretty much, and that''s a major concern. (Grower 2) Although one
    interviewee acknowledged that “there are work arounds” for the limitations to
    digital infrastructure (Grower 1), there remained a degree of scepticism about
    how much the rural and regional digital infrastructure would improve in the near
    future, which some interviewees linked to the further widening of the city/country
    divide: And our other big problem that’s going to become more pronounced is just
    lack of Internet access… I’m not sure what''s going to come out of the rollout
    of the NBN [National Broadband Network] but…we’re going to be left off the end
    of that and a lot of this sort of stuff is going to be quite data hungry that
    we should and could be using. So I’m not sure what the answer to that is but it’s
    certainly going to create a bigger city/country divide. (Grower 5) 4.2.3 Governance
    of data privacy, security and ownership The adequacy of current regulations and
    practices to protect the privacy and security of farmers’ data was another issue
    that was mentioned by several participants. Some interviewees were satisfied that
    privacy and security measures would be adequate: So we have privacy policies that
    are inserted into our licensing agreements with growers on an annual basis. And
    they obviously take into account federal and state requirements. And we update
    them as there are any changes in local requirements in Australia around privacy.
    (Input provider 3) However, other interviewees expressed more concern: …All that
    privacy stuff, it’s just can of worms. And it’s got the potential to completely
    explode. But we are so reliant on our technology nowadays, that we can’t really
    stop it. …So definitely some healthy scepticism and concern about how that sort
    of privacy can go. And I think people just need to become more and more aware
    of it - me included. And making those safeguards to make sure that you can protect
    your data. (Grower group 6) Moreover, even with privacy and security measures
    in place, breaches are always going to be a risk: …I think that it is incumbent
    upon organisations that are storing data that they need to be doing their very
    best to maintain that security, but at the same time the consumers and the farmers
    need to understand that there can be breaches that happen from time to time even
    with the best intentions. And that’s always going to be a risk. (Input provider
    3) The broader dynamics surrounding data ownership, data sharing and the way in
    which the benefits from this are distributed also emerged as key themes. Data
    was understood as a valuable commodity, hence data ownership was an important
    theme within discussion about the implications of these emerging technologies:
    “I have to admit everyone seems caught up in [the idea] that data will be valuable
    therefore I should focus on owning it and extracting insight from it” (Input provider
    1). Many growers were concerned that large corporations could capture this value,
    possibly at the expense of local growers, based in part on observations about
    how these issues are playing out in the United States: Now, if there is value
    in it you kind of want to make sure that if we’re doing all this, we want a little
    bit of something back and I guess the fear is the big players swoop down, grab
    it, run off and make some big business model and they make a good living off it
    and the guys that generate it all miss out. …I’m of the thinking that we’re probably
    at the bottom of the food chain. We’ve got something that maybe someone wants
    collectively and if they get it for nothing it just doesn’t feel right. (Grower
    4) Many interviewees expressed uncertainty about rights to data ownership and
    use: It would be…really good to know how the information could be misused…actually
    that''s probably as relevant as anything, to be honest, the risk side of it, how
    could it be misused, so then we can make an informed decision about where it goes
    and how it’s used. (Grower 2) Competing views were particularly evident regarding
    the principle that growers own their on-farm data. Some interviewees accepted
    digital agriculture service providers’ assurances that growers’ retained ownership
    of their on-farm data under emerging Big Data opportunities. For example, one
    interviewee discussed the approach taken by a major company to ownership of farm
    data: But effectively what [the company] has said is that if data is generated
    by a farmer or from their farming equipment on their farm, that data is owned
    by the farmer. … And…if a farmer brings their data to [the company] or they generate
    it through their equipment and it’s used as part of [the company’s] systems, if
    the farmer wants to leave, they can take their data with them, and we [the company]
    don’t own that data. …That’s why I do really like the guiding principles that
    [the company] have put in place. (Input provider 3) However, other interviewees
    expressed a more critical view, focusing instead on how that data may be used
    and by whom it might be used. Thus, lack of trust in data ownership regulations
    is a key factor mediating perceptions of these new forms of technologies: They
    [digital agriculture service providers] say the farmer owns the data, the farmer,
    legally that’s true but practically what does it mean? Almost nothing. A far more
    interesting and pertinent question is what are they doing with that farm data?
    (Grower 2) The lack of trust also reflects established belief systems and normative
    roles between farmers and agribusiness. Several participants referenced the unequal
    power relations that were seen to exist between farmers and large businesses:
    But it depends on how the information is going to be disseminated once it’s collected
    as well and who has control of it. And that’s one of the areas that really worries
    me is that it seems to me that most farmers are still reasonably small and most
    of the businesses they deal with are reasonably large so there’s going to be an
    inequity in the data. (Local government 1) Concerns around data ownership and
    use also related to the boundaries around what data growers are comfortable with
    sharing and what data they want to protect: I’d be more worried about that…when
    you sign the dotted line to buy that tractor you lose control of the data without
    really realising it. … Well I think one farmer versus [a large company], we’ve
    got Buckley’s. …[T]he information about how many hours our tractors do, what sort
    of conditions do they work in, what problems they have, that’s all great information
    to have. [The large company] needs that information to build better tractors,
    more efficient, which is going to benefit us. I think the data that we have that’s
    most value to other people is our yields, our varieties that are much more specific
    to our farms. Our gross margins, our business information. And that we should
    be more able to keep control of. (Grower group 6) As a consequence, some interviewees
    raised doubts about the willingness of growers to share their on-farm data, even
    with other growers: But I can’t see people openly sharing their data. I can see
    people giving you a bit of something that you might need, or sitting down with
    your agronomist, giving them some stuff. But I can’t see me and you, being farmers
    that are 100 km away, really, openly sharing. We might talk on basics, but I’m
    never going to let you take my yield maps and you’re never let me take yours.
    We might look at them together and talk about different farming methods and the
    physical, but you’re never going to walk away with that data, I wouldn’t have
    thought. (Input provider 4) It was clear that the perceived adequacy of data ownership
    and third party benefit regulation, along with inequalities and lack of trust
    between farmers and large agribusinesses were directly connected with willingness
    to adopt in practice Big Data applications that involve data sharing: “I think
    the risk lies in farmers being confident that they don’t need to lock up their
    data and make it absolutely unavailable to anyone except a very narrow limited
    range of providers” (Grower group 2). One interviewee pointed out that the industry
    needed to better explain the value proposition for access and use of on-farm data:
    …the industry has done, frankly, a terrible job of explaining why they want access
    to farm data. Not so much an issue probably here in Australia yet, it’s probably
    just starting to happen now, but in the US it’s been going on for quite a few
    years, and it’s even more so. ….So it’s this weird thing where they don’t want
    to tell us exactly what they’re doing with it but if they don’t tell us what they
    do with it, why would we trust them? …[P]robably mostly they are doing the right
    thing but that’s not explained anywhere and we’re certainly just trusting that’s
    what they say they’re doing, there’s no way of verifying it…and that’s what’s
    holding more farmers back from adopting it, but we miss out on the benefits of
    it then as well. (Grower 1) Thus, issues of trust and transparency, based on normative
    roles between farmers and agribusinesses, have the potential to constrain the
    willingness of farmers to participate in smart farming technologies. 5 Discussion
    Our interviews reveal how grains industry stakeholders portrayed the potential
    benefits that smart farming technologies offer, both on-farm and across the industry
    value chain. Interviewees also raised a range of concerns about these emerging
    technologies, from technical issues such as data accuracy and reliability through
    to broader concerns about the social and institutional context within which these
    new technologies operate and are governed. We now consider how theoretical insights
    from the MLP approach and social practice theory can inform our interpretation
    of grains industry stakeholders perceptions of these benefits and risks associated
    with Smart Farming and Big Data applications. The MLP approach identifies three
    nested hierarchical levels of a socio-technical system that socio-technical transitions
    must navigate: niche innovations (micro level); regimes (meso level) and landscapes
    (macro level). Drawing on the MLP approach, we found that niche level mobilisation
    processes are currently using on-farm benefits as the key means to establishing
    a vision and value-proposition for smart farming. Smart farming platforms in the
    grains industry such as ProductionWise and YieldProphet are designed to help improve
    on-farm decision-making. The fact that these benefits were also expected to accrue
    across the supply chain and even more broadly is likely to facilitate changes
    to processes and systems at the regime level. This confluence of benefits could
    be harnessed to support the collaboration required for effective use of Big Data
    applications, if potential barriers and risks of the kind identified in our study
    can be mitigated or managed. For example, the potential to derive national benefit
    from Big Data applications may support collaboration across firms and organizations
    along with regional co-investment, which participants believed would be needed
    to support the diffusion of such innovation. This supports commentary in the literature
    that collaboration across firms and organizations will be necessary in order to
    fully realise the potential benefits of Big Data applications in agriculture (
    Sonka, 2016). However, elements of the socio-technical regime and landscape are
    constraining niche level innovation. For instance, a major constraint at the landscape
    level is the current state of Australia’s digital infrastructure, which in rural
    and regional areas is not currently sufficient to support the full potential of
    smart farming technologies. The challenges surrounding rural and regional digital
    infrastructure and the growing divide in data infrastructure quality between urban
    and rural areas have been noted elsewhere and are a significant issue to overcome
    in the effort to build sustainable digital futures for rural and regional communities
    ( Salemink et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2017; Pant and Hambly Odame, 2017). There
    are also important niche-regime interactions shaping social responses to smart
    farming. The current state of data governance at the regime level is an important
    factor, as seen by the range of concerns held by stakeholders about the adequacy
    of current regulations to protect the privacy and security of farmers’ data and
    to manage data ownership rights (see also Dyer, 2016). There are currently no
    governing legal principles in Australia that clarify and build trust for producers
    around the access and use of agricultural data. This lack of ag-data standards
    and licensing arrangements contributes to the lack of trust that producers have
    towards data contracts ( Wiseman and Sanderson, 2017). Digital agriculture service
    providers seek to address concerns about privacy and data ownership through written
    contracts, which specify the terms and conditions regarding data ownership and
    use ( Keogh and Henry, 2016). The lack of trust is in part due to the way in which
    some user agreements “bury exclusions deep in the document which in effect give
    free reign to the software providers…to use the data in many different ways, including
    via the sale or transfer of the data to a third party” ( Keogh and Henry, 2016:
    37). Lack of trust due in part to previous experience, can lead to apathy and
    withdrawal ( Stern and Baird, 2015). Other researchers have identified that concerns
    over data sharing are also related to the dynamics of power relations between
    industry stakeholders ( Wolfert et al., 2017; Avelino and Wittmayer, 2015; Nelson
    and Tallontire, 2014; Avelino and Rotmans, 2009). Thus, institutional arrangements
    for data ownership and sharing in the current regime are not providing a trusted
    environment necessary to encourage a willingness to share data. Although the MLP
    approach provides a useful lens for examining the multi-level dynamics shaping
    potential trajectories for Big Data applications, we now turn to social practice
    theory for further insights into how people are currently responding to these
    emerging technologies. While the MLP approach puts technology at the centre of
    analysis, social practice theory focuses on the actions of people and the way
    in which images and meanings, materials (including technologies) and competencies
    and skills shape dynamic systems through interacting and co-evolving practices
    ( Shove and Walker, 2010; Shove et al., 2012). Social practice theory therefore
    helps to uncover the importance of human agency and sheds light on the “inevitable
    contests and politics” that are involved in transitions ( Hinrichs, 2014: 149).
    In terms of the images and meaning given to smart farming technologies, grains
    industry stakeholders that we interviewed considered Big Data applications to
    be one of the most important developments in agriculture. These new technologies
    were portrayed as offering the potential to transform Australian agriculture through
    improved on-farm decision-making, prediction and analysis, leading to significant
    productivity gains. On the one hand, this is part of an emerging shift in what
    it means to be a farmer, with increasing emphasis on management skills and knowledge
    over hands-on labour. On the other hand, these smart farming technologies build
    on existing precision agriculture technologies and are therefore broadly compatible
    with existing everyday routines and practices within dominant forms of farming.
    However, we found that perceptions of who would benefit most from these emerging
    technologies shaped the images and meaning given to these technologies. Furthermore,
    data sharing arrangements are not currently part of everyday routines and practices,
    which underpins some of the concerns around putting Big Data applications into
    practice. While the potential for Big Data applications to aid decision-making
    at both the on-farm and broader industry level was a common theme in descriptions
    of the benefits of these technologies, the greatest financial returns on implementing
    Big Data approaches were largely reported to be tied to businesses upstream and
    downstream of the farm gate (i.e. input suppliers and manufacturers, traders and
    marketers), rather than farmers themselves (see also Fleming et al., 2018). Marketers
    and traders expected that Big Data would allow them to better predict export demand
    and prices, however growers expressed concerns that this could exacerbate the
    commercial advantage these groups currently exercised over growers. Consequently,
    growers were concerned that disproportionate benefit from Big Data applications
    would accrue to businesses upstream and downstream of the farm gate and indeed
    believed that growers were most exposed to potential risks and exploitation of
    these technologies within supply chains already characterised by power asymmetries.
    Furthermore, many participants also made reference to the city/country divide.
    This deep cultural pattern was linked to issues of trust and inequality more generally,
    such as the belief that the benefits of Big Data would accrue to large corporations
    (urban entities) with farmers (rural actors) losing control of their own data
    and thus the benefits to be derived from it. This aspect of Australia’s cultural
    identity is influencing how Big Data applications and related innovations are
    perceived. This is further exacerbated by the lack of trust in current data governance
    arrangements, outlined in relation to the MLP approach. When combined, these factors
    shape perceptions of the meaning and value of these technologies and their potential
    implications for stakeholder relationships in the agricultural sector. Social
    practice theory also focuses attention on skills and competencies that are needed
    to underpin novel practices. It takes new skills to properly apply and interpret
    the results of Big Data systems and analysis. However, the skills and capacity
    of different grains stakeholders to engage with or benefit from Smart Farming
    (including Big Data applications) is presently highly varied, especially amongst
    farm businesses. There were growers who were investing heavily in digital technology,
    sensing, automation and other data intensive elements of their business in readiness
    for future Big Data applications. These growers reported that they were already
    realising benefit from that investment. However, for the majority of growers we
    interviewed, the benefits they receive are likely to be realised longer term or
    ‘down the track’ and in many cases appear uncertain. In the short to medium term,
    concerns about transparency, equity (in terms of the distribution of benefits),
    data ownership and access appear to dominate. Similar themes have emerged in other
    studies investigating digital transformation in the farming sector in Australia
    ( Guthrie et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) as well as in New Zealand ( Shepherd
    et al., 2018), North America ( Bronson and Knezevic, 2016; Carolan, 2016; Carbonell,
    2016) and Europe ( Wolfert et al., 2017; Poppe et al., 2015; Regan et al., 2018).
    This suggests that our findings have broader applicability, particularly in terms
    of the importance of trust and transparency as central themes underlying social
    responses to the risks and costs associated with the use of on-farm data, which
    in turn have the potential to limit the informed and consensual participation
    of all stakeholders in Smart Farming and Big Data applications. 6 Conclusion and
    recommendations The successful implementation of Smart Farming and Big Data applications
    depends on ensuring that the design and implementation of these technologies respond
    to stakeholder dynamics within the agricultural sector, including the way in which
    these novel technologies are understood, adopted and adapted in practice by farmers
    and other decision-makers ( Sonka, 2016; Wolfert et al., 2017; Bronson and Knezevic,
    2016). Trusted information and advice networks are likely to be important mechanisms
    for growers in mediating the benefits and risks of engaging with these regime
    factors. As such, alignment of these new opportunities with existing (or re-negotiated)
    trust relationships is a critical enabling condition. Therefore, our primary recommendation
    is the need to invest in building the capability of growers and farm businesses
    to be both informed data consumers as well as co-creators and curators of data,
    by involving growers and their trusted information and advisory networks in the
    cooperative development and trialling of these systems. We argue such actions
    would broker the understanding of everyday practices and decisions of farmers
    at the niche level, with the networks, norms and structures of regime-level elements
    that enable or constrain possible transitions. Key questions remain, for example:
    what are the implications of emerging and diverse models of services and governance
    of Smart Farming and Big Data applications, and how adequate are they at meeting
    the requirements of transparency, shared benefit and access raised in this study?
    We found that participants’ views were divided on this point. Furthermore, since
    advances in Smart Farming are also likely to converge with a variety of information-based
    compliance processes (e.g. food safety and environmental regulation), it will
    also be necessary to understand how this regime level convergence is likely to
    impact on farm productivity related developments and the regulation of agricultural
    production and supply chains at the enterprise level. There is an important role
    for social researchers working in a participatory way with industry, corporate,
    research, development and extension and other stakeholders to identify the complex
    and intertwined factors and processes influencing the deployment of Smart Farming
    and Big Data applications. Such research will support their ongoing improvement,
    assess their transferability between sectors or growing regions and ultimately
    help to ensure that the application of these novel technologies has the widest
    possible benefit across the agricultural sector. Acknowledgments This study was

    \ 2022\nAbstract\nThe rise and spread of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has\
    \ created an imbalance in all sectors worldwide, massively \ndisrupting the global\
    \ economy. Social distancing, quarantine regulations, and strict travel restrictions\
    \ have led to a major \nreduction in the workforce and loss of jobs across all\
    \ industrial sectors. One of the sectors completely exposed was the agri-\nculture\
    \ and food sector. The initiation of a nationwide lockdown by the government resulted\
    \ in the shutdown of industries \nglobally impacting the overall supply chain\
    \ from farmer to consumer. The need of the hour is to propose effective solutions\
    \ \nwhich can serve the dual purpose of market growth as well as customer satisfaction.\
    \ This paper reviews the impact of COVID-\n19 on the agro-food system and its\
    \ economy stressing critical factors like food production, demand, price hikes,\
    \ security, \nand supply chain resilience. To conserve natural resources and meet\
    \ the sustainable development goals (SDG), importance \nhas been given to adopting\
    \ sustainable agricultural practices with a prime focus on techniques like urban\
    \ agriculture, crop \nrotation, hydroponics, and family farming. Possible advancements\
    \ like the use of digital tools, mainly artificial intelligence, \nmachine learning,\
    \ deep learning, and block-chain technology, in the agro-food sector have been\
    \ discussed as they could be \na promising tool to develop a self-reliant society.\
    \ This work would be a perfect platform to understand the growing impact \nof\
    \ the pandemic as well as supporting cost-effective solutions for a green ecosystem.\n\

    Introduction\nThe outbreak of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pan-\ndemic posed\
    \ a significant threat to health with a ripple effect \non various sectors impacting\
    \ human life. The virus rapidly \nspread and affected economies thus bringing\
    \ out inefficien-\ncies in both the agriculture and industrial sector resulting\
    \ \nin food insecurity (Jámbor et al. 2020). Different national \nand international\
    \ organizations like Food and Agricultural \nOrganization (FAO), International\
    \ Food Policy Research \nInstitute (IFPRI) have tried to keep the global market\
    \ open \n(Pu and Zhong, 2020). However, the rapid transmission of \nthe virus\
    \ resulted in several nations restricting international \ntrade and travel resulting\
    \ in poverty, hunger, and malnutri-\ntion across the globe (Torero, 2020).\nThe\
    \ virus showed its first signs in December 2019 when \na pneumonia outbreak took\
    \ place in the Wuhan province \nof China (Abbott et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2020).\
    \ World \nHealth Organization (WHO) later declared the outbreak \nof COVID-19\
    \ as public health emergency of international \nconcern in January 2020 (Saadat\
    \ et al. 2020; Usman et al. \n2020). The continuous transmission of the virus\
    \ has led to \ncrude mortality of 3.4% across the world. The initial out-\nbreak\
    \ of COVID-19 was seen in China and gradually spread \nto 190 countries across\
    \ the world (Sharma et al. 2020a). \nAs of September 2020, India has become one\

    1 3\nepicenters of COVID-19. According to the National Institute \nof Epidemiology\
    \ and recent Bloomberg report, the coun-\ntry could easily surpass USA and Brazil\
    \ due to the daily \nsurge in cases (Altstedter, 2020). The COVID-19 virus can\
    \ \nbe transmitted through direct surface contact, touch, or via \nrespiratory\
    \ drops while sneezing or coughing (Mandal et al. \n2020). The virus has also\
    \ been shown to impact individuals \nwith low immunity or those who live in densely\
    \ populated \nregion (Eisenberg, 2020).\nThe hidden cascading domino effect has\
    \ proved preven-\ntion as a challenging path in this interconnected world. \n\
    The majority of the growing sectors have been adversely \nimpacted including the\
    \ agriculture and food industry. The \nsector continues to combat challenges from\
    \ the aspect of the \nproducer as well as consumers for restrictions, labor short-\n\
    ages, speed to market, and priority buying of commodities \n(Luckstead et al.\
    \ 2020; Rajput et al. 2020).\nFor decades, agriculture has played a critical part\
    \ in \nfostering the economy of different nations. It has been the \nsource for\
    \ early development in countries like the UK, \nFrance, and the Netherlands (Allen,\
    \ 2000). Major transfor-\nmations in the agriculture sector were observed in the\
    \ late \n1900s where there was a switch from labor-intensive and \nbullock farming\
    \ to mechanization and usage of large equip-\nment in the twenty-first century\
    \ as depicted in Fig. 1 (de Jan-\nvry and Sadoulet 2020). Along with modern equipment,\
    \ the \nimprovements in crop varieties, animal-based farming, and \nusage of different\
    \ fertilizers were other interests to increase \nyield and production capacity.\
    \ This created a spark for revo-\nlutionizing the agro-food sector.\nThe agro-industry\
    \ has always been the expected root of \ngrowth for balancing import–export and\
    \ managing interna-\ntional trade relations (Qiao et al. 2019). With the sudden\
    \ \noutbreak of COVID-19, the sector has been hit with severe \nissues related\
    \ to trade, transport, price volatility, and rising \ndebts. To add on, the declaration\
    \ of nationwide lockdown \nexacerbated the situation resulting in shortage of\
    \ labor \nsupply, lack of availability of fertilizers, imbalance in sup-\nply–demand,\
    \ and problems associated with post-harvesting \ndue to social distancing (Consultancy\
    \ Asia, 2020; Insights, \n2020).\nWith the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the agriculture\
    \ \nsector is facing huge challenges in satisfying the increasing \ndemands for\
    \ food. Factors like health and nutrition-based \nfoods, improving safety, poverty\
    \ reduction, and environmen-\ntal sustainability have been of vital importance\
    \ since the dis-\nease outbreak (Christiaensen and Martin 2018; Chatterjee, \n\
    2020). An increase in the production capacity of crops and \nfoods giving adequate\
    \ focus to safety and sustainability has \nbecome the top priority during this\
    \ pandemic. The use of \neco-friendly fertilizers and other biological alternatives\
    \ may \nenhance crop productivity and replace harmful chemicals. \nHowever, these\
    \ products are expensive and take months to \ndeliver to the market. In recent\
    \ years, there has been a prom-\nising approach toward sustainable agriculture\
    \ and farming \nto deliver better health and economic outcomes (Arora and \nMishra\
    \ 2016; Hellin et al. 2020). Capitalizing the advan-\ntage of information and\
    \ communication technologies (ICTs), \nfunctioning and efficiency of the supply\
    \ chain management \ncan be increased extensively. For instance, the mobile pro-\n\
    curement of perishable commodities can be incentivized \n(Kumar et al., 2020).\
    \ Digital technologies, and satellite and \ndrone technologies can allow remote\
    \ sensing for crop growth \ndevelopments and soil moisture. Computing techniques\
    \ can \nallow digital tools like artificial intelligence (AI), machine \nlearning\
    \ (ML), and deep learning to process large amounts \nof data in a short span of\
    \ time for faster speed to market. \nHowever, the need of the hour is to increase\
    \ the value of \nsuch digital technologies for a better reach and an efficient\
    \ \nsupply chain.\nThis review addresses the impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic\
    \ on the agro-food sector in the areas of food \nFig. 1  Agricultural transforma-\n\
    tion through the years\n42510\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023)\
    \ 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nproduction, pricing, and supply chain. A special focus\
    \ has \nbeen given to the adoption of sustainable farming techniques \nand agricultural\
    \ practices to ensure food security. Few rec-\nommendations have been addressed\
    \ for enhanced agriculture \nwith the utilization of digital technologies like\
    \ AI, AI-based \nconcepts, and block-chain as they could progress to an agri-\n\
    culture creating a green agro-ecosystem.\nImpact of COVID‑19 on agriculture\n\
    The agriculture sector is a source of income for more than \n1 billion people\
    \ across the globe. Agriculture production, \nincluding different stages from\
    \ planting, growing, nurtur-\ning, harvesting to shipping of goods, needs labor\
    \ require-\nments (Workie et al. 2020). The dependence of market value \nchains,\
    \ food, and agricultural sectors are considered to be \nless resilient due to\
    \ the occurrence of the pandemic. The \nimpact of COVID-19 on the agricultural\
    \ sector is discussed \nbelow (Fig. 2).\nAgriculture production\nAgriculture production\
    \ has been an engine for reducing \npoverty and food security. The ongoing pandemic\
    \ has \nadversely affected the value chain from farmers to retailers \n(Sharma\
    \ et al. 2020b). Local restrictions and travel bans \nhave led to limited access\
    \ to farm inputs (seeds, fertilizers, \netc.) and resulted in low agricultural\
    \ production (Aromo-\nlaran and Muyanga, 2020). This could be attributed to the\
    \ \nhike in the price of farm inputs like seeds, chemical ferti-\nlizers, reduced\
    \ household income, lack of availability of \ninputs, and labor shortage during\
    \ the initial months of the \npandemic (Aromolaran and Muyanga 2020).\nThe global\
    \ pandemic caused a shortage of workers for \nthe cultivation of non-staple crops\
    \ like fruits and veg-\netables affected planting and harvesting. Canada, USA,\
    \ \nand Europe have a shortage of nearly 1 million migrant \nworkers from Eastern\
    \ Europe and African countries (FAO \n2020a). In India, the nationwide lockdown\
    \ has adversely \naffected the harvest of winter crops. Lockdown has forced \n\
    the migrant laborers as well as small-scale shopkeep-\ners to forcefully shut\
    \ down their business and return to \ntheir homes leading to a shortage of labor.\
    \ A financial \nimbalance was also observed with the exchange of dif-\nferent\
    \ types of equipment that the small-scale farmers \nrent for harvest (S. Mahendra\
    \ Dev 2020). A recent report \nestimated that there has been an overall decrease\
    \ in agri-\nculture production in Southeast Asian countries of 3.11% \n(17.03\
    \ million tons) in the first quarter of 2020 due to the \nabsence of laborers\
    \ on the farm (Gregorio and Ancog, \n2020).\nDeveloped countries utilize highly\
    \ sophisticated \nmechanized equipment for the cultivation of crops like \nwheat,\
    \ rice, maize, and other vegetables. These types of \nmachinery can be used for\
    \ different activities like land \ndevelopments, irrigation, planting, and sowing.\
    \ Due to \nlabor-intensive farming, many staple crops had not been \ncultivated\
    \ due to lockdown measures, leading to low food \nproduction and food insecurity\
    \ (FAO 2020b). On the con-\ntrary, due to excessive production of crops and imposing\
    \ \nof strict rules and regulations (Trade and travel), farmers \nwere forced\
    \ to dump crops in various parts of Nepal, USA, \nand India (Poudel and Subedi\
    \ 2020; WFO 2020a, b). The \nshortage in the employees and poor food supply network\
    \ \nFig. 2  Describing the overall \nimpact of COVID-19 on agri-\nculture and\
    \ farming systems\n42511\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023)\
    \ 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nforced the industries to shut down resulting in huge uncer-\n\
    tainties in the global food sector (FAO 2020c).\nAgriculture production has also\
    \ indirectly disrupted \nthe fertilizer and pesticide industry with the imbalance\
    \ in \nthe supply of fertilizers like urea, potash, ammonia, and \nphosphate which\
    \ are necessary for the growth and nutrient \nmanagement of plants. The sudden\
    \ factory shutdown and \nlimited transportation facilities delayed the flow of\
    \ product \ntoward the market and farmers (Affognon et al. 2020). This \nled to\
    \ many crops getting rotten and several being used as \nmanure owing to massive\
    \ losses.\nDifferent coping strategies were adopted to strengthen \nthe agro-food\
    \ sector during the pandemic. Some of them \nwere (1) mechanization of agriculture\
    \ to reduce the load \namong workers and to avoid time delays (Daum and Birner\
    \ \n2020); (2) introducing staggered shifts of labors, which \ncould be one of\
    \ the ways adopted to ensure the minimal \ndistance between workers, therefore\
    \ minimizing the risk of \ntransmission (Laborde et al. 2020); (3) post-harvest\
    \ man-\nagement to minimize the harvest loss and to ensure proper \nstorage of\
    \ goods through hermetic packaging and triple \nbagging technology against seed\
    \ infestation for grains and \ngrains (Baoua et al. 2014; Ng’ang’a et al. 2016;\
    \ Afzal \net al. 2020); and (4) implementation of farming support \nand extension\
    \ service for the grievances of farmers on \nallied areas (Baloch and Thapa 2019;\
    \ Affognon; et al. \n2020).\nFood demand\nThe consumption of food during the lockdown\
    \ rose due to \nrapid transmission leading to panic shopping and back stock-\n\
    ing of commodities. Various staple foods like beans, rice, \nand packaged foods\
    \ were in great demand due to better shelf \nlife. At the beginning of March,\
    \ consumption of products \nlike pasta, flour, rice, and canned foods increased\
    \ by more \nthan 150% as they had a higher shelf life (Mengoub, 2020).\nAs an\
    \ aftereffect of COVID-19, the demand for food dras-\ntically increased. For instance,\
    \ the “food away from home” \nsector accounts for 10% of the fruit consumption,\
    \ 32% of \nvegetables, 25% of dairy, and 31% of cereals. This particular \nsector\
    \ accounts for at least 25 to 30% of total sales of fresh \nfruit and vegetables.\
    \ In addition to logistical challenges, \nhouseholds’ consumption patterns at\
    \ home are different from \nthose away from home (OECD 2020).\nFood prices\nAs\
    \ a major effect of COVID-19, the global food price has \nlinearly increased from\
    \ February 2020. According to the \nFAO Food Price Index (FFPI), the international\
    \ price of food \ncommodities reached the highest level of 97.19 points in \n\
    September 2020 (FAO 2020d). The value increased by 5% \nsince last year and was\
    \ the highest between September and \nFig. 3  Possible implementation of lean\
    \ PDCA model by the government\n42512\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research\
    \ (2023) 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nFebruary (Fig. 3). Similarly, a significant rise\
    \ was seen in the \nprice index of cereals and vegetable oils for four consecutive\
    \ \nmonths. This was mainly due to the greater shelf life in food \ncommodities\
    \ (FAO 2020d).\nAn article revealed that the price of 14 commodities \nincreased\
    \ by 6.4% including apples, chicken, potatoes, eggs, \nbeef, milk, rice, tomatoes,\
    \ cheese, bread, lettuce, onions, \nand rice based on food price hike in 136 country–food\
    \ com-\nbinations (Nordhagen, 2020). FAO (2020e) highlighted \nthat prices have\
    \ increased by 20% in Afghanistan, 35% in \nYemen, and by 50% in Syria since April\
    \ and faced severe \nfood shortages in the countries (FAO 2020e). The primary\
    \ \nreasons for the price hike during COVID-19 were the \ndemand, panic purchase,\
    \ and back stocking of goods. Other \nfactors responsible were the shortage of\
    \ laborers, closure of \nfood processing plants, lack of marketing platform, disrup-\n\
    tions in the global supply chain due to travel ban, and sort-\ning of commodities\
    \ (Sen, 2020). As a long-term effect of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, this may also\
    \ lead to inadequacy \nleading to unemployment, high cost, and low production.\n\
    The control of food price hikes is necessary to ensure the \naccessibility of\
    \ nutrient-rich diet to the citizens at an afford-\nable right price. Therefore,\
    \ stringent actions and necessary \nrevisions in the policy frameworks are necessary\
    \ to con-\ntrol inflation in this sector. As a first step, governments and \n\
    NGOs should focus on social protection programs for the \neconomically backward\
    \ classes (M 2019). They should also \nmake sure of the availability of nutrients\
    \ and food resources \nfor children, women, and other vulnerable communities in\
    \ \nspecific. Second, timely revision in the trade and tax poli-\ncies should\
    \ be done to ensure proper trade and availability \nof goods inside and outside\
    \ the country (M 2019). Third, \nsupport should be extended to small farms to\
    \ enhance pro-\nductivity, pre- and post-harvest loss, and training on opening\
    \ \nup e-commerce channels. Finally, initiating food fortifica-\ntion programs\
    \ in rural areas to provide micronutrients to \nvulnerable communities is crucial\
    \ to reduce the effects of \nthe pandemic (Gharibzahedi and Jafari 2017).\nSupply\
    \ chains resilience\nThe tremendous amount of disruptions has been caused in \n\
    the food security and supply chain areas. Leading the supply \nchain, farmers\
    \ play a crucial role in land management, crop \nmanagement, post-harvest, and\
    \ maintaining soil pH and mois-\nture. Now, with the advent of the pandemic, workers\
    \ are find-\ning it a challenge to maintain a balance between labor, social \n\
    distancing, and livelihood. Restrictions imposed in many parts \nof the world\
    \ have made transportation of food and crops close \nto impossible. A recent report\
    \ highlighted the shortage of \ntruck drivers for transporting goods in developing\
    \ countries \nlike India (Saul, 2020a) as workers and migrant laborers in \nfactories\
    \ or production houses fear to resume work due to the \ntransmission. The lack\
    \ of raw material supplies to factories \nhas led to the deterioration of quality\
    \ in the finished product. \nShips and huge cargos were forced to lay idle in\
    \ Asia and \nEurope following strict quarantine guidelines leading to a huge \n\
    delay in purchase orders (Todd R Smith 2020). This has led to \nimmense pressure\
    \ building up indirectly on the consumers as \nthe goods fail to reach the market\
    \ on time. When it comes to \nretailers in the USA, the country has faced a $700\
    \ million hit \ndue to coronavirus. Shipping consultancy Alphaliner estimated\
    \ \nthe cancellation of 46% of the scheduled departures from Asia \nto Europe\
    \ for more than a month (Saul, 2020b). However, due \nto the strict local lockdown\
    \ and increased port congestion, \ncarriers were finding it a challenge to transport\
    \ goods. The \nsudden drop in the world’s economy and lack of supplies due \n\
    to transportation barriers has led to a huge rise in the cost of \nall food commodities.\n\
    The Chinese government recently launched a “Clean Plate \ncampaign” where families\
    \ and groups must order one dish less \nthan the number of total number of diners\
    \ to understand the \nfood shortage issues and crisis (BBC 2020). When it comes\
    \ to \nconsumers, the mentality of buying has completely changed \nin the last\
    \ few months. The idea of “prioritizing” their list of \nitems has emerged due\
    \ to the scare of the virus along with job \nstress. Table 1 gives a detailed\
    \ description of the immediate, \nshort-term, and long-term impacts on supply\
    \ chain drivers and \nfood security due to COVID-19 (Mutikani, 2020).\nThe potential\
    \ long-lasting impact of COVID-19 is seen on \nboth the demand and supply chain\
    \ of the food and agricultural \nsector across the globe. The FAO has highlighted\
    \ a set of rec-\nommendations to tackle the issues related to supply chains: \n\
    (1) expanding food assistance programs and social protection \nprograms; (2) use\
    \ of e-commerce channels for purchase and \ndelivery of goods; (3) focus on bottlenecks\
    \ in logistics depart-\nment to keep up the food value chain; (4) strategies to\
    \ keep \ninternational trade open and amendment in trade and tax poli-\ncies;\
    \ (5) proper management of macroeconomic ramifications \n(Paulo and Santos Gomes,\
    \ 2020; Cullen, 2020). In addition to \nthese strategies, good government policies\
    \ and frameworks \nare required to minimize the time delay through transporta-\n\
    tion restrictions. Moreover, the public should encourage the \nadaptation of local\
    \ food supply chains to ensure adequate \navailability of staple foods (Hobbs,\
    \ 2020). Figure 3 shows the \npossible implementation of the lean PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-\n\
    Act) model by the government.\nFood security\nFood security means ensuring the\
    \ availability and acces-\nsibility of a sufficient amount of nutrient-rich foods\
    \ to all \ncommunities. Figure 4 explains the range from food security \nto food\

    \ security is to ensure enhancements \nin food access. Developing a metric scale\
    \ for food security \ncould be one of the potential ways to enable adequate food\
    \ \nfrom households to low-income line. Over the last decade, \nclimate change,\
    \ population boom, hike in food price, and \nenvironmental constraints posed a\
    \ great impact on food \nsecurity. The international travel restrictions created\
    \ severe \ntroubles in the production, supply, and trade of agronomi-\ncal products\
    \ in the global market (Swinnen and McDermott \n2020). In addition to this, many\
    \ countries imposed stringent \nsocial protection measures to combat COVID-19\
    \ (Swinnen \nand McDermott 2020).\nDifferent articles have highlighted the economic\
    \ fallout \nacross deprived countries in the world. In this global sce-\nnario,\
    \ reports estimated that 140 million people may fall into \nextreme poverty with\
    \ a marginal increment of 20% from the \npresent stages. Food security particularly\

    \ disruption of markets and \nimproper public distribution system due to non-availability\
    \ \nof food stocks (Bahadur Poudel et al. 2020). The reduction \nin food production,\
    \ rapidly declining reserves, and trade \nconstraints are likely to influence\
    \ food security between \n2020 and 2021. The potential impact of COVID-19 on food\
    \ \nsecurity can be further prolonged in the form of economic \ndisruptions, lowered\
    \ investments in the agriculture sector, \ngovernment expenditure, and financial\
    \ assistance toward the \nfarmers (Udmale et al. 2020).\nRecommendations to ensure\
    \ food security among the \nvulnerable community of a society (Lawson-Lartego\
    \ and \nCohen, 2020; FAO 2020e) are as follows: (1) protection \nof food supply\
    \ chains and all allied services to ensure the \nmovement of goods, (2) proper\
    \ utilization of food reserves \nto meet the requirements according to demands,\
    \ (3) protec-\ntion of farmers and food workers by providing subsidized \ninputs\
    \ and other services to avoid disruptions in the food-\nsupply chain; (4) keeping\
    \ global trade market open to ensure \navailability of all commodities and avoid\
    \ price hike due to \npanic buying or hoarding; (5) adopting sustainable farming\
    \ \npractice to meet the daily household demands; (6) introduc-\ning social protection\
    \ programs to reduce the risk of hunger \nand starvation among vulnerable groups\
    \ through providing \nfood materials.\nMethods to develop a resilient food system\n\
    Adaptation of more resilient food production \nsystem based on sustainable forms\
    \ of agriculture\nFAO explained sustainable agricultural development as \na tool\
    \ for the management and conservation of the natu-\nral resource and the orientation\
    \ of technological change to \nensure the satisfaction of human needs for a better\
    \ tomorrow \n(FAO 2014) The development of this particular agenda was \nto achieve\
    \ zero hunger challenge, environmental advance-\nment, and to attain social sustainability\
    \ through the develop-\nment of living standards. Five major principles that balance\
    \ \nall the domains like socioeconomic–environmental areas of \nthis sector are\
    \ listed below (FAO 2014):\n• Principle 1: Improving efficiency of food production\
    \ \nthrough proper utilization of resources is important in \nsustainable agriculture.\n\
    • Principle 2: Protection of natural resources.\n• Principle 3: If agriculture\
    \ fails to protect and improve \nrural livelihoods, equity and social well-being\
    \ are unsus-\ntainable.\n• Principle 4: Enhanced resilience of community, citizens,\
    \ \nand ecosystem are responsible for sustainability.\n• Principle 5: The need\
    \ for effective governance and super-\nvision.\nSustainable agricultural development\
    \ can be adopted \nusing different methods either through complete organic \n\
    agriculture or using different principles. Some of the major \nsustainable farming\
    \ methods are reported in Fig. 5. Adopting \nthese agricultural practices improves\
    \ agriculture production \nalong with the conservation of biodiversity with minimal\
    \ \necological hazards. Sustainable agriculture methods like \nurban agriculture\
    \ and family farming can be practiced in \ndeveloping a self-sustained agro-food\
    \ economy to ensure \nfood security.\nUrban agriculture\nUrban agriculture is\
    \ the production of necessary crops and \nlivestock within cities for the benefit\
    \ of citizens (Zezza and \nTasciotti 2010). Innovative and sustainable growing\
    \ methods \nused in urban areas are community gardens, rooftop farms, \nbackyard\
    \ farms and gardens, greenhouse farms, and indoor \nhydroponic farms. It is also\
    \ reported that urban farming \nimproved sustainability through integration with\
    \ building \nand household wastes (Weidner et al. 2019). Different prod-\nucts\
    \ like vegetables, cereals, fruits, spices, flowers, dairy, \nmeats, and livestock\
    \ are produced using urban agriculture \n(De Bon et al. 2010; Weidner et al. 2019).\
    \ Urban agriculture \nFig. 5  Sustainable farming methods\n42515\nEnvironmental\
    \ Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nhas also shown to\
    \ generate opportunities in terms of employ-\nment and business. A literature\
    \ study reported the develop-\nment of urban agriculture in sustainable cities\
    \ with emphasis \non social safety, employment, and promoting environmental \n\
    sustainability (Azunre et al. 2019).\nUrban agriculture can be considered a highly\
    \ resilient \nfarming technology as it overcomes the short supply chain \nand\
    \ diversified farming methods (Khan et al., 2020). The \ndifferent studies reported\
    \ that urban agriculture has grown as \na sustainable method to ensure food security\
    \ on the planet. \nFor example, in Cuba, 1  m2 is capable of producing 20 kg \n\
    of food items per year. This could meet the daily needs of a \nfamily and excess\
    \ crops can generate income and employ-\nment (Altieri and Nicholls (2020). Yoshida\
    \ and Yagi (2021) \nemphasized the resilience and sustainability of urban agri-\n\
    culture in Japan. The results indicated that urban farming \nwas resilient to\
    \ the pandemic and the authors termed this \nresilience as persistence. Second,\
    \ sustainable farm activi-\nties improved the intentions for the development of\
    \ farms. \nThe direct marketing strategy, entrepreneurship, and social \nnetworks\
    \ also help urban agriculture. The improved pro-\nductivity of urban agriculture\
    \ is the best method to attain \nlocal food security by increasing the accessibility\
    \ of the \nfamilies toward food. So, urban agriculture can be utilized \nfor post-COVID\
    \ or any other pandemic which may occur in \nthis world.\nPolyculture and crop\
    \ rotation\nPolyculture is defined as the cultivation of more than one \nspecies\
    \ at the same time and place along with the conserva-\ntion of biodiversity. Different\
    \ methods of polyculture include \nintercropping, cover cropping, strip cropping,\
    \ and integrated \naquaculture (Andow 1991; Bracken 2008). The crop diver-\nsity\
    \ in polyculture helps in the control of pests, weeds, and \ndiseases, with the\
    \ minimum usage of chemical aids (Iverson \net al. 2014). High diversity makes\
    \ the system more stable \ntoward weather conditions, soil fertility, and maintaining\
    \ a \nbalanced diet. Therefore, the main advantages of this farm-\ning technique\
    \ are better yield and fast sowing, stable and \nconsistent income, and minimum\
    \ emission of greenhouse \ngases. The slower harvest and more economic investment\
    \ \nmajorly hinder its development on a larger scale. Crop rota-\ntion is a sustainable\
    \ farming method of growing different \nvarieties of crops in a common area across\
    \ different sea-\nsons (Zhao et al. 2020). Crops like legumes (alfalfa, clo-\n\
    ver), grasses, cereals, and vegetable crops are implemented \nthrough intercropping\
    \ or multiple cropping and an organic \napproach (Baldwin 2006; Sharma et al.\
    \ 2018; Zhao et al. \n20202020). This strategy will minimize the loss of fertility\
    \ \nin the soil where both polyculture and crop rotation use a \nminimum quantity\
    \ of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and \nimprove soil fertility. However,\
    \ special care should be taken \nin terms of crop selection for a better yield.\n\
    Hydroponics\nHydroponics, in simple terms, refers to a “garden in the \nabsence\
    \ of soil.” This technology aims to grow healthy plants \nrich in quality and\
    \ sensory attributes but with the help of \nlight, nutrient dosing, and mineral-rich\
    \ water. It is reported \nthat by providing the right amount of nutrients and\
    \ water, \nthe plants grow 50% faster than they do in soil-based media \n(Sanchari\
    \ Pal 2016). Currently, the USA has the fastest mov-\ning hydroponics market in\
    \ the world followed by Europe \nand Scandinavia. Various agro-food start-ups\
    \ in the USA \npromote hydroponics in small-scale farms. In Jordan, FAO \nlaunched\
    \ a project on hydroponic technology on account of \nwater scarcity in the country.\
    \ The initiative has also aimed \nto contribute to employment for youth and woman\
    \ job \nseekers promoting more opportunities (FAO 2020f). Spain, \nFrance, and\
    \ Netherlands use either large greenhouse agricul-\ntural areas or tunnel-like\
    \ greenhouses to lead a sustainable \nenvironment. Scandinavian countries have\
    \ increased their \ndemand for this technology due to harsh climatic conditions.\
    \ \nThe plants are grown indoors in many households during \nwinters (ValueStrat\
    \ 2019). Figure 6 shows the working \nmethodology of a hydroponic system. India\
    \ and China too \nare improving and investing heavily in this technology due \n\
    to their large population density and lack of available land. \nAdvantages are\
    \ efficient water use, limited pesticides, and \nhigher yields and food production\
    \ throughout the year. So, \nhydroponics is a well-known planting methodology\
    \ for the \ncultivation of crops in the urban areas where fertile land is \nhighly\
    \ limited (Khan et al., 2020).\nFamily and community farming\nFamily farming and\
    \ community farming are vital to the \neconomies of all countries. The objective\
    \ of these techniques \nis to produce and deliver food that is environmentally,\
    \ eco-\nnomically, and nutritionally sustainable. Family farming is \ndeveloping\
    \ family farms through their labor, land, dedica-\ntion, and passion on a small\
    \ scale for their needs. It is an \nopportunity to develop family-based agriculture\
    \ in the world \nfor food security, socio-ecological sustainability, and eco-\n\
    nomic development (Graeub et al. 2016). Latin American \ncountries like Brazil,\
    \ Uruguay, and Paraguay have taken \npositive steps to combat the world food crisis\
    \ by encourag-\ning local family farming (Cervantes-Zapana et al. 2020).\nSimilarly,\
    \ the community-supported agriculture or com-\nmunity farm is a direct partnership\
    \ between farmers and \na consumer group to share the risk and responsibilities\
    \ of \nfarming operations. Community farming follows the agro-\necological method\
    \ to produce high-quality food materials. \n42516\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution\
    \ Research (2023) 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nThis method also develops an alternative\
    \ distribution system \nthrough direct contact with the farmers that is independent\
    \ \nof traditional market behavior. This results in sales of farm \nproducts locally\
    \ which benefits both consumers and farmers.\nGroup farming on the family basis\
    \ or community base \nis always better than individual farming as they can enjoy\
    \ \nthe economies of scale, higher investible funds, skills, and \nminimized input\
    \ costs. One such example is the group farm-\ning stated by the Government of\
    \ Kerala through the women \ngroup farm under the Kudumbashree mission. Currently,\
    \ \nthere are almost 68,000 farms across the state, which are \nmaintained by\
    \ women. Studies claimed that the group farms \nof Kerala yielded 1.8 times the\
    \ annual value of output per \nhectare and fivefold net return. The study also\
    \ proved that \nthe group farms survived the pandemic as they were able \nto sell\
    \ their products locally and through the community \nkitchens under the tag of\
    \ Kudumbashree (Shagun, 2021). \nHaga (2020) described that adopting such farming\
    \ methods \nis beneficial to meet the demands of the domestic markets. \nThe involvement\
    \ in the market at the local level is helpful to \nensure the continuous food\
    \ supply which is helpful to over-\ncome the issues created by COVID-19 regarding\
    \ logistical \nand transport issues. The use of family members as labor \navoids\
    \ the labor shortage. Resilient farmers are necessary \nto develop a resilient\
    \ food system. Small farming can build \na resilient food system in a post-COVID\
    \ world.\nThe concept of family farming and community farming \nis dependent on\
    \ the policy of individual countries that \ndescribe the production of goods relied\
    \ on labor and land. \nAlong with the maintenance of rural sustainability and\
    \ \neconomy, they always tend to enhance natural resources. \nThe advantages of\
    \ these farming methods are economic \nbenefits, better productivity, food security,\
    \ social inclu-\nsion, employment, crop diversification, and minimum \n CO2 emission\
    \ (Cervantes-Zapana et al. 2020). The adop-\ntion of these farming practices will\
    \ ensure the adequate \navailability of food resources and maintain food security\
    \ \nin this scenario. Recommendations to strengthen family \nand community farming\
    \ activities (Bruil, 2014) are as \nfollows:\n• Adopting cross-sectoral and territorial\
    \ approaches to \nintegrate rural development (rural infrastructure, tradi-\n\
    tions, indigenous knowledge, culture, youth develop-\nment).\n• The strengthening\
    \ of technical capabilities of rural \ncommunities through rapid training and\
    \ education pro-\ngrams.\n• Developing stronger farmer organization to consolidate\
    \ \nthe voice of farmers in policymaking and framework of \nnew regulations.\n\
    • Accessibility of natural resources like water, land, and \nadopting voluntary\
    \ guidelines.\n• Improving trade and building markets for promotion of \nlocal\
    \ markets, storage, and transportation.\nFig. 6  Work flow schematic of a hydroponic\
    \ system\n42517\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:42509–42525\n\
    1 3\nAdvantages, challenges, and recommendations\nThrough adopting these techniques,\
    \ we can improve the agri-\nculture distribution that may be helpful to yield\
    \ integration \nof natural biological cycles and controls. This development \n\
    tool (1) protects and enriches the fertility of the soil and \nnatural resource\
    \ base, (2) minimizes the production inputs, \n(3) reduces the usage of renewable\
    \ resources, (4) conserves \nenergy with minimum emission of greenhouse gases,\
    \ (5) \nimproves food production with minimal waste, and (6) pro-\nmotes family\
    \ farming and family communities. During this \nscenario, the development of a\
    \ sustainable agriculture sys-\ntem will always help people to be self-dependent\
    \ as they \nwill cultivate crops for their family more organically and \nsustainably.\
    \ Along with these advantages, sustainable agri-\nculture development creates\
    \ job opportunities through which \nfood security can ensure and further benefited\
    \ in poverty \nalleviation. Therefore, the practice of sustainable agriculture\
    \ \ndevelopment is a key strategy to be addressed as it makes \nself-sufficient\
    \ economies during pandemics like COVID-19.\nThe major challenges in adopting\
    \ sustainable agriculture \ndevelopments are discussed below:\n 1. Availability\
    \ of water: To address sustainable agri-\nculture, the proper use and conservation\
    \ of water is \nextremely important. The present farming systems face \nextreme\
    \ stress in the availability of water due to water \npollution and drought along\
    \ with inefficient irrigation \npractices. As a result, farmers of Egypt have\
    \ shifted to \ncultivation of commercial crops like wheat and cot-\nton which\
    \ utilize minimum quantity of water (Shalaby \net al. 2011). Therefore, significant\
    \ importance should \nbe given to irrigation management to address the \nissues\
    \ related to water utilization. Recommendations \nto improve water utilization\
    \ are as follows:\n 2. Rainwater harvesting involves collection of rainwater \n\
    mainly from rooftops and swollen streams. This tech-\nnique ensures that farmers\
    \ have a substantial amount \nof water stored during the summer season.\n 3. Adopt\
    \ lining channels or closed conduits to reduce \nconveyance loss.\n 4. Avoid over-irrigation\
    \ to restrict surface water runoff \nand percolation loss.\n 5. Use of drip-irrigation\
    \ systems or a sprinkler system to \nminimize transportation loss during irrigation.\n\
    \ 6. Availability of land resources: The need for fertile land \nis a driving\
    \ force for the cultivation of any type of \ncrop. The deterioration of land quality\
    \ is due to sea-\nsonal shifts, surface erosions, and waterlogging. Along \nwith\
    \ urbanization and industrialization, climate change \nis also attributed to land\
    \ loss in different regions like \nAfrica, South America, India, and Europe (Zhang\
    \ \nand Cai 2011). Therefore, the practice of sustainable \nmethods like hydroponics,\
    \ polyculture, urban farm-\ning, and family farming is encouraged due to minimal\
    \ \nland requirements. The efficient land utilization can be \nachieved using\
    \ the following:\n 7. The need for proper land reclamation policies.\n 8. Adopting\
    \ hydroponics and vertical farming for the cul-\ntivation of vegetables and to\
    \ overcome issues related \nto land availability.\n 9. Encourage organic farming\
    \ to maintain soil fertility.\n 10. Soil testing at regular intervals to assess\
    \ the pH and \nother soil parameters.\n 11. Lack of support services towards farmers:\
    \ Farmers find \ninadequate support services with respect to accessibil-\nity\
    \ of farm inputs like seeds, fertilizers, etc. Most of the \nrural farmers face\
    \ inadequate access toward extension \nservices and technology transfer. The farmers\
    \ belong-\ning to rural side of India and African countries lack \nknowledge in\
    \ advanced technologies related to crop \nprotection and management (Shalaby et al.,\
    \ 2011). \nHowever, an efficient and extensive support center \ncan be developed\
    \ through introducing 24*7 call centers \nand special training programs on advanced\
    \ technolo-\ngies.\nOther recommendations also include the following:\n• Fixed\
    \ cash transfers and an improved supply chain. With \nthe ill-effects of the pandemic\
    \ rising exponentially, set-\nting targets play a crucial role for effective planning.\n\
    • Coping strategies like setting up a specific amount or \na donation limit which\
    \ needs to be provided to lower-\nincome class, migrants, laborers, and pregnant\
    \ women at \nsuch uncertain times (Workie et al., 2020). Such strate-\ngies will\
    \ improve the livelihoods of the country as well \nas control the economy of the\
    \ country.\n• Global food decentralization: increasing the usage of \nlocal food\
    \ products and processing technologies most \nsuited for the particular environmental\
    \ condition. The \nsystem makes an attempt to improve the countries’ eco-\nnomic\
    \ growth, thereby saving logistics time making it \nmore self-reliant. For instance,\
    \ countries like Uganda \nmade an attempt to build a decentralization system from\
    \ \ndistrict to village level (Nathan et al., 2020). Continu-\nous campaigns were\
    \ undergone to strengthen this sys-\ntem, making it better for households to receive\
    \ food at \nthe right time. The method has also noticed resilience \nin countries\
    \ like the UK having a remarkable adaptive \ncapacity (Dominic et al., (2020).\
    \ It is noteworthy to men-\ntion that the whole process involves least involvement\
    \ \nwith stakeholders and third parties, thereby reducing \ncosts with an improved\
    \ planning.\n• Adopting digital technologies for crop monitoring and \npest management,\
    \ developing advanced eco-agricultural \n42518\nEnvironmental Science and Pollution\
    \ Research (2023) 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nengineering models based on the suitability\
    \ of applica-\ntions, implementing an awareness program on the usage \nof pesticide\
    \ and its health hazards, development of proper \nfood storage and processing\
    \ industries, and good govern-\nment policy and framework to support farmers.\n\
    Technology‑supported agricultural development\nInnovative opportunities toward\
    \ technology advance-\nments are one of the most promising approaches toward \n\
    improving consumer demands across the world. Ade-\nquate focus should be given\
    \ to business models and sali-\nent features as mentioned in the UN 2030 Sustainable\
    \ \ndevelopment agenda (Nilsson et al. 2016). It is impor-\ntant to understand\
    \ the changing needs of consumers with \ntime to remove the inefficiencies in\
    \ the agricultural sys-\ntem. One possible path to handle post-pandemic situ-\n\
    ations is adopting advanced technologies in the agro-\nfood sector. The key aspects\
    \ for future enhancements \nshould be addressed mainly on three factors: economic,\
    \ \nenvironmental, and social impact of the product/process. \nThe following are\
    \ the technological and financial devel-\nopments that can be introduced for progressing\
    \ toward \nimproving the sustainability and the production compo-\nnent in the\
    \ system.\nDigitalization\nThe digitalization of agriculture is one of the areas\
    \ widely \ngiven importance in recent years as it could be the next agri-\ncultural\
    \ revolution. Figure 7 gives a detailed understanding \nof the versatility of\
    \ digitalization post-pandemic in differ-\nent sectors with a major focus on agro-food\
    \ sector. Table 2 \nshows the utilization of digital technologies from producers\
    \ \nto consumers. The technology could help farmers under-\nstand their land and\
    \ crop better by offering information and \ncollecting data on crops, weather\
    \ forecasts, soil conditions, \ncrop quality, and fertilizer management. In addition,\
    \ farms \nwill also be able to reduce costs by applying the concept \nof digital\
    \ tools through the usage of robotics and autono-\nmous machines (Mentsiev et al.\
    \ 2020). When it comes to \nfood processing units, usage of sensors and sensor-based\
    \ \ntechnologies could enhance the overall productivity of food \ncommodities.\
    \ For instance, an investigation on application \nof sensor-based chips was analyzed\
    \ as they had the potential \nto inhibit oxygen and maintain food quality (Gaikwad\
    \ et al. \n2018). In recent years, machines have also been equipped \nwith sensors\
    \ to detect foreign particles or waste in food \n(Islam et al. 2020). Thus, we\
    \ can conclude that the utiliza-\ntion of creative and innovative technologies\
    \ could have a \nhuge potential in changing the methodology of production, \n\
    delivery, and consumption of foods.\nFig. 7  Versatility of digitalization post-pandemic\
    \ in various sectors with a major focus on agro-food sector\n42519\nEnvironmental\
    \ Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:42509–42525\n1 3\nThe integration of\
    \ information technology (IT) with \nagriculture and food production has shown\
    \ remarkable \nprogress in improving productivity and aiding farming to \nmake\
    \ informed decisions. A good example of this is the \nintroduction to precision\
    \ agriculture. This farming involves \nan innovative concept, which uses the principles\
    \ of AI to \nprocess data for a value-added agriculture. The technology \ncould\
    \ help farmers understand their land and crop better by \noffering information\
    \ and collecting data on crops, weather \nforecasts, soil conditions, crop quality,\
    \ and fertilizer man-\nagement. In addition, farms will also be able to reduce\
    \ costs \nby applying the concept of digital tools through the usage of \nrobotics\
    \ and autonomous machines (Mentsiev et al. 2020).\nThe concept of AI involves\
    \ subfields mainly ML, deep \nlearning, and neural networks. Figure 8 involves\
    \ the applica-\ntion of subfields of AI. In recent years, machine learning and\
    \ \ndeep learning has gained a lot of interest in the agro-food \nsector. ML works\
    \ under running algorithms for statistical \npredictions and inferences (Smith\
    \ et al 2019). For instance, a \nstudy proposed an ML-based integrated approach\
    \ to forecast \nthe seasonal rainfall for assessing the climatic conditions in\
    \ \nAustralia (Feng et al. 2020). Gümüşçü et al. 2019 estimated \nthe wheat crop\
    \ planting date using ML algorithms based \non the available climatic data. The\
    \ data was collected and \nprocessed using genetic algorithms, where farmers could\
    \ \nanalyze the conditions and take decisions. A study was also \nconducted on\
    \ mapping the carrot yield based on concepts \nof precision agriculture and ML\
    \ (Wei et al. 2020). Recently, \na biosensor chip was introduced in China which\
    \ uses the \nconcept of AI and ML to keep track of pigs’ age, location, \nand\
    \ health in farms (Houser, 2018). A US-based agri-food \ncompany introduced agri-robots\
    \ and self-driving tractors \nwhich helped farmers pick and pack strawberries\
    \ and pepper \n(CROO 2014; Faggella 2020). An agri-tech start-up in Ber-\nlin,\
    \ Germany, developed an application that can monitor soil \ncrops just by clicking\
    \ photos. The software reads the photo \nand understands soil defects, detect\
    \ pests in land, and show \nthe crop efficiency patterns using principles of ML\
    \ and IoT \n(Kennepoh, 2020). This posed an essential tool for making \ndecisions\
    \ on improving agricultural practices.\nAnother innovative field growing under\
    \ the concept of \nAI is deep learning. The concept focuses on the processing\
    \ \nof appropriate datasets to get the desired output (Chen and \nRan 2019). Deep\
    \ learning has proven effective in handling \nmany vision-based tasks like image\
    \ recognition, classifica-\ntion, segmentation, object analysis, and fruit detections.\
    \ This \ncan be seen clearly with the analysis done by Balasubrama-\nnian et al.\
    \ who studied plant phenotyping for efficient crop \nmanagement using deep learning\
    \ theories (Balasubramanian \net al. 2020). Advancements in deep learning theories\
    \ with \nmachine learning have led to predictions of large amounts \nof data,\
    \ automatic extraction, and better efficiency in agri-\ncultural methodologies.\
    \ Usage of sensors and sensor-based \ntechnologies could enhance the overall productivity\
    \ of food \ncommodities. For instance, Gaikwad et al. (2018) inves-\ntigated the\
    \ application of sensor-based chip in packaging \nwhich can inhibit the oxygen\
    \ and determine the food quality. \nThe chip, once installed, can detect the quality\
    \ of the food \nTable 2  Utilization of digital technologies from producer to\

    product within seconds. In recent years, machines have also \nbeen equipped with\
    \ sensors to detect foreign particles or \nwaste in the food production line (Islam\
    \ et al., 2020). They \nserve as a dual purpose in helping the whole supply chain\
    \ \nin analyzing crop conditions and detecting weeds or pests \nin large farms\
    \ thus balancing the overall yield. Although \nthese technologies are in their\
    \ nascent stages, there is a huge \npotential to diversify with a faster speed\
    \ to market.\nOverall, the utilization of these technologies is highly \nbeneficial\
    \ for attaining a resilient agricultural system. Digi-\ntal tools such as artificial\
    \ intelligence help the farmers to be \npreemptive regarding the pest treatment\
    \ that can curb crop \ndamage and save money. The key advantages are as follows:\
    \ \n(1) they help farmers know the information about soil, crop \nyields and weather\
    \ patterns through IoT sensors and sat-\nellites; (2) application of innovation\
    \ agriculture increases \nyields and profits; (3) the digital agriculture is transforming\
    \ \nthe food production and helps us to grow using minimum \nresources and investment.\
    \ Thus, we can conclude that the \nutilization of creative and innovative technologies\
    \ could \nhave a huge potential in changing the methodology of pro-\nduction,\
    \ delivery, and consumption of foods.\nBlock‑chain technology\nAddressing food\
    \ and supply-chain distribution, emerging \ndigital strategies like block-chain\
    \ technology will allow \neasier trade and transactions. Block-chain will allow\
    \ greater \ntransparency in the supply chain and agriculture, thus reduc-\ning\
    \ unwanted and untrusted parties. The agro-food system \nnetwork utilizing block-chain\
    \ can be described in the fol-\nlowing process:\n1. Farmer: Receives information\
    \ about crops, fertilizer dos-\nage and requirements, pesticides, and tools needed\
    \ using \nweb services, agricultural scientists, and food technolo-\ngists. Transactions\
    \ between the distributor and farmer \nare recorded.\n2. Production line: Food\
    \ production methodology, process-\ning, fertilizer dosage, nutrient control,\
    \ and soil manage-\nment data are stored using sensors and drones.\n3. Retailer:\
    \ Logistics, export, shipping, and time details are \nrecorded and monitored.\
    \ Financial transactions done are \nrecorded in the block-chain network, thus\
    \ notifying the \nsuppliers.\n4. Consumer: Food commodity is shipped to the super-\n\
    market where barcode scanning processes the informa-\ntion and connects the sales\
    \ success to the whole supply \nchain.\nBlock-chain will allow greater transparency\
    \ in the supply \nchain and agriculture, thus reducing unwanted and untrusted\
    \ \nparties (Kamilaris et al. 2019). A recent article by the World \nEconomic\
    \ Forum published in The Economic Times pro-\nposed a “block chain deployment\
    \ toolkit” with an aim to \nmaximize the benefits with the least risks providing\
    \ a lean \nFig. 8  Application of subfields of AI in agro-food sector\n42521\n\
    Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2023) 30:42509–42525\n1 3\ntechnology.\
    \ The kit will cover aspects and best practices \nexecuted across industries,\
    \ multinationals, startups, aca-\ndemic institutions, and supply-chain departments\
    \ to ensure \ncooperation and accelerate the economy in post-pandemic \nstate\
    \ (World Economic Forum 2020). Currently, North \nAmerica owns the largest share\
    \ of the world’s block-chain \ntechnology in food supply chains and agricultural\
    \ markets. \nThis could be majorly due to food safety concerns leading \nto greater\
    \ research and development. Europe, on the other \nhand, is looking for opportunities\
    \ in agriculture and supply-\nchain markets with block-chain technology (Market\
    \ growth \n2018). When it comes to Switzerland, it was highlighted \nthat the\
    \ country has a separate section on “economy” in its \nconstitution keeping agriculture\
    \ on par with other sectors \nlike banking, beverage, and gaming (Goedde et al.\
    \ 2017). \nIn Asia, China and India have the fastest growing market \nand excellent\
    \ forecast accuracy due to the increasing food \nwastage population.\nThe block-chain\
    \ technologies are deployed to yield high \nefficiency and the integrity of the\
    \ agricultural applications. \nAs a summary, the main uses of the block-chain\
    \ are (1) prov-\nenance traceability and food authentication, (2) smart farm-\n\
    ing data management, and (3) supply-chain management. \nThe implementation of\
    \ block-chain can be concluded as an \nefficient and promising technology for\
    \ the rise in agriculture \nand improvement in food supply chain distribution.\n\
    Conclusion\nThe unprecedented pandemic has posed several challenges \nin the agro-food\
    \ systems worldwide affecting major areas \nof production, dietary changes, environment,\
    \ transportation, \nand overall supply chain. Restrictions in movements, vari-\n\
    ations in supplies, and challenges in logistics due to social \ndistancing and\
    \ strict quarantine measures have posed huge \nbarriers in providing affordable\
    \ and nutritious food to all. \nTherefore, food systems and food security are\
    \ significantly \ninterrupted with a higher impact on the vulnerable popula-\n\
    tion. Thus, one of the key lessons learned due to the spread \nof the virus would\
    \ be building a resilient food system. The \ngrowth of advanced technologies in\
    \ the industry as discussed \nin this review may play a key role in enhancing\
    \ food-supply \npractices. Innovations like developing new products, ser-\nvices,\
    \ and introducing new financial schemes which address \nchallenges faced in agricultural\
    \ sectors would be the key \nto achieve sustainability. Family farming and community\
    \ \nfarming make our households and individuals more self-\nsustainable. The drastic\
    \ changes in human behaviorism with \nrespect to the eating and purchasing habits\
    \ tending to a more \nnutritious and plant-based food may grow in the future.\
    \ The \nadvent of digitalization and the growth of digital market-\ning would\
    \ allow customers to order and deliver any item at \ntheir doorstep. Thus, we\
    \ can conclude that understanding the \ngravity of the situation and acting effectively\
    \ will aid a more \nsocio-technologically innovative ecosystem.\nAuthor contribution\

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\

    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\

    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    \ are helping to improve and transform a multitude of industries in the modern\
    \ world, \nand agriculture industry is no exception. Today, data is transforming\
    \ one of the world’s oldest industries: \nagriculture.  Agriculture has become\
    \ increasingly high-tech and data-driven over the years.  To counter the \nglobal\
    \ problems of increasing food demand and climate changes, agriculture professionals\
    \ are now \npushing for data-driven agriculture, which offers cost savings and\
    \ business opportunities. This paper \naddresses the use of big data in agriculture\
    \ and the management of farming processes. \n \nKeywords: big data; big data analytics;\
    \ agriculture; farming\n \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture is critically important\
    \ for the future of our \nmodern society. It is regarded as one of the oldest\
    \ \nvocations known to mankind. It is the backbone of any \nnation’s economy as\
    \ well as the global economy. In \nsome places like Africa and India, majority\
    \ of rural \nresidents depend on agriculture for their livelihood.  \nAgriculture\
    \ supplies our food, energy, and medicine [1]. \n \nToday, the agriculture sector\
    \ is facing several challenges \nsuch climate change, increasing population, increasing\
    \ \nlabor shortages, land and water constraints, increasing \nurbanization, \n\
    environmental \ndegradation, \nchanging \ndietary habits, coping with the latest\
    \ technology, \nachieving more with less, etc. The United Nations has \nestimated\
    \ that the global population will reach 9.8 billion \nby 2050, indicating the\
    \ urgent need to produce more \nfood production in order to feed the growing population\
    \  \nwith less land to grow it on. These enormous challenges \ncan be dealt with\
    \ by adopting advanced technologies \nsuch as Internet of things, cloud computing,\
    \ GPS \ntechnology, satellites, drones, robots, and artificial \nintelligence.\
    \ \nThese \ntechnologies \nare \ntransforming \nagriculture and generating massive\
    \ volumes of data, \nknown as big data. Big data is critical to help agriculture\
    \ \nmeet the challenges.  \n \nAgriculture has gone through several revolutions:\
    \ \nindustrial revolution, green revolution, biotechnology \nrevolution, and more\
    \ recently the big data revolution.  It is \nundergoing a digital revolution.\
    \ Traditional skill-based \nagriculture is rapidly transforming into digital and\
    \ data-\ndriven agriculture with big data playing a critical role in \nenhancing\
    \ productivity. To extract useful information from \nthe generated data requires\
    \ a new generation of \npractices/tools known as “Big Data Analytics.” Data \n\
    analytics is aimed at deriving knowledge and wisdom from \ndata as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1 [2]. Digital information on \nsoil, weather, climate, crop, etc.,\
    \ is fundamental to digital \nagriculture and predictive data analytics. \n \n\
    BIG DATA CHARACTERISTICS \nBig data (BD) is a relatively newer technology that\
    \ can \nmake use of smart city services. The three main sources of  \n \n \nbig\
    \ data are machines, people, and companies. As shown in \nFigure 2 [3], big data\
    \ can be described with 42 “Vs”.  The \nfirst five “Vs” are volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity, and \nvalue [4]. \n \n Volume: This refers to the size of\
    \ the data being \ngenerated both inside and outside organizations and \nis increasing\
    \ annually.  Some regard big data as data \nover one petabyte in volume.  \n \n\
     Velocity: This depicts the unprecedented speed at \nwhich data are generated\
    \ by Internet users, mobile \nusers, social media, etc. Data are generated and\
    \ \nprocessed in a fast way to extract useful, relevant \ninformation. Big data\
    \ could be analyzed in real time, \nand it has movement and velocity. \n \n Variety:\
    \ This refers to the data types since big data may \noriginate from heterogeneous\
    \ sources and is in \ndifferent formats (e.g., videos, images, audio, text, logs).\
    \ \nBD comprises of structured, semi-structured or \nunstructured data.  \n \n\
     Veracity:  By this, we mean the truthfulness of data, i.e. \nweather the data\
    \ comes from a reputable, trustworthy, \nauthentic, and accountable source. It\
    \ suggests the \ninconsistency in the quality of different sources of big \ndata.\
    \ The data may not be 100% correct.  \n \n Value: This is the most important\
    \ aspect of the big data. \nIt is the desired outcome of big data processing.\
    \ It \nrefers to the process of discovering hidden values from \nlarge datasets.\
    \ It denotes the value derived from the \nanalysis of the existing data. If one\
    \ cannot extract some \nbusiness value from the data, there is no use managing\
    \ \nand storing it. \n \nOn this basis, small data can be regarded as having low\
    \ \nvolume, low velocity, low variety, low veracity, and low \nvalue. Additional\
    \ five “Vs” have been added [5]: \n \n Validity: This refers to the accuracy\
    \ and correctness of \ndata. It also indicates how up to date it is. \nInternational\
    \ Journal of Scientific Advances  \n \nISSN: 2708 \n \nAvailable Online at www.ijscia.com\
    \ | Volume 1 |  Issue 1 |  Jul-Aug 2020 \n45 \n \n Viability:  This identifies\
    \ the relevancy of data for each \nuse case. Relevancy of data is required to\
    \ maintain the \ndesired and accurate outcome through analytical and \npredictive\
    \ measures. \n \n Volatility: Since data are generated and change at a \nrapid\
    \ rate, volatility determines how quickly data \nchange. \n \n Vulnerability:\
    \ The vulnerability of data is essential \nbecause privacy and security are of\
    \ utmost importance \nfor personal data. \n \n Visualization: \nData \nneeds\
    \ \nto \nbe \npresented \nunambiguously and attractively to the user. Proper \n\
    visualization of large and complex clinical reports \nhelps in finding valuable\
    \ insights. \n \nInstead of the 5 “Vs” above, some suggest the following 5 \n\
    “Vs”: Venue, Variability, Vocabulary, Vagueness, and \nValidity [6]. \n \nIndustries\
    \ that benefit from big data include the healthcare, \nfinancial, airline, travel,\
    \ restaurants, automobile, sports, \nagriculture, and hospitality industries.\
    \ Big data technologies \nare playing an essential role in farming: machines are\
    \ \nequipped with sensors that measure data in their \nenvironment. \n \nBIG DATA\
    \ ANALYTICS  \nEvery day, data is growing bigger and bigger, and big data \nanalysis\
    \ (BDA) has become a requirement for gaining \ninvaluable insights into data such\
    \ that companies could \ngain significant profits in the global market. Big data\
    \ \nanalytics and the Internet of things (IoT) form the \nfoundation of the smart\
    \ city model. Smart city initiatives \nneed big data analytics to function. Once\
    \ the big data is \nready for analysis, we use advanced software programs \nsuch\
    \ as Hadoop, MapReduce, MongoDB, and NoSQL \ndatabases [7].  Big data analytics\
    \ refers to how we can \nextract, validate, translate, and utilize big data as\
    \ a new \ncurrency of information transactions. It is an emerging \nfield that\
    \ is aimed at creating empirical predictions. Data-\ndriven organizations use\
    \ analytics to guide decisions at \nall levels [8]. \n \nData scientists know\
    \ how to use tools that identify \npatterns and relationships that may otherwise\
    \ remain \nhidden.  They are part of virtually every major industry, \nand agriculture\
    \ is no exception. Agricultural big data \nanalytics is expected to ensure better\
    \ farming practices, \ndecision-making, and a sustainable future for humankind.\
    \ \nThis will involve artificial intelligence and machine-\nlearning technologies\
    \ to determine better farming \npractices and decision-making [9]. \n \nWHY BIG\
    \ DATA IN AGRICULTURE? \nData were always regarded as an important source of \n\
    knowledge for farmers, agricultural professionals, and \npolicy-makers. Farming\
    \ has been empirically driven for \nover a century but the data collected was\
    \ not digital.  \nThe agriculture community deals with a massive \namount of structured\
    \ and unstructured data.  In order \nto make economically and environmentally\
    \ sound \ndecisions a management of information is needed. The \nraw information\
    \ from crops is turned into profitable \ndecisions only when efficiently managed.\
    \  \n \nBig data is sometimes regarded as a combination of \ntechnology and analytics\
    \ that can collect and process data \nin a more useful and timely way to assist\
    \ decision-making. \nIt is the focus of in-depth, advanced, game-changing \nbusiness\
    \ analytics. It is poised to reproduce long-standing \nrelationships between food\
    \ system players and thus it \ndeserves scholarly attention from food scientists\
    \ [10].The \nadoption of analytics in agriculture has been growing, with \nthe\
    \ objective of presenting the analytics to farmers in an \napproachable format.\
    \ Figure 3 illustrates big data in \nagriculture [11]. \n \nBig data is moving\
    \ into agriculture in a big way and \nforming agricultural “big data,” which creates\
    \ the \nnecessity for large investments in infrastructures for data \nstorage\
    \ and processing. Agricultural big data means a lot \nof data is created naturally\
    \ from different stages from \nsowing seed to harvesting. Important arrangements\
    \ for \nthe management of big data include agreements on data \navailability,\
    \ data quality, access to data, security, \nresponsibility, liability, data ownership,\
    \ privacy, and \ndistribution of costs. An important aspect of big data is \n\
    that it requires using analytical tools to extract value \nfrom it, improving\
    \ the productivity of farmers and \nagriculture professionals. Without such analysis,\
    \ big data \ncan be expensive, time consuming, and useless. \n \nAPPLICATIONS\
    \ OF BIG DATA IN AGRICULTURE \nBig data and Internet of things are poised to revolutionize\
    \ \nfarming practices and operations of agro-food sector.  \nApplication of big\
    \ data is a key tool to digitalize the \nagriculture sector.  Modern agricultural\
    \ practices adopt \ndigital technology for the transformation of traditional \n\
    agriculture to modern agriculture. It covers virtual \nagriculture, precision\
    \  agriculture, smart agriculture, \nautomated  agriculture,  digital agriculture,\
    \ data-driven \nagriculture, sustainable agriculture, lean agriculture, and so\
    \ \non [12].  Thus, big data applications in agriculture include \nsmart farming,\
    \ data-driven agriculture, precision farming, \nsensor deployment and analytics,\
    \ and predictive modelling \n[13, 14]. \n \n Smart Agriculture/ Farming:  \n\
    The integration of big data in the agricultural sector leads \nto the concept\
    \ of smart farming or smart agriculture. The \nultimate goal of agriculture is\
    \ to achieve smart farming. \nThe concept of smart farming refers to farm managing\
    \ \nusing data analytics, communications systems, IoT, ICT, \nsensors, GPS, satellite,\
    \ robots, drones, etc.  With all of these \ntechnologies, farmers can collect\
    \ data, monitor the field \nconditions without physically going to the field,\
    \ and make \nstrategic decisions [15]. Smart farming is important for \ntackling\
    \ the challenges of agricultural production in terms \nof productivity, environmental\
    \ impact, food security, and \nsustainability. Smart agriculture is a major tool\
    \ to handle \nand manage the threats, challenges, risks, diseases, and \npest\
    \ attack and ensure sustainability.  Figure 4 depicts \nsmart farming [16]. \n\
    \ \n Data-driven Agriculture:   \nModern farming practices will become increasingly\
    \ data-\ndriven and data-enabled. Data-driven agriculture offers \ncost savings\
    \ and business opportunities. It sets the \ngrounds for the sustainable agriculture\
    \ of the future.  \nData-driven agriculture has proven useful for all parties\
    \ \nthroughout all stages. Big data analytics is an essential \ntool for big data-driven\
    \ agriculture. Farmers can now \nleverage big data and use data-driven risk assessments\
    \ to \nevaluate the chances of disruptive events.  \n \n Precision Agriculture:\
    \  \nAs the name suggests, precision agriculture makes a \nprecise plant and cattle\
    \ treatment possible.  It is about \nproviding more accurate farming techniques\
    \ for planting \nand growing crops.  Its main objective is to ensure \nprofitability,\
    \ efficiency, and sustainability using the big\nInternational Journal of Scientific\
    \ Advances  \n \nISSN: 2708 \n \nAvailable Online at www.ijscia.com | Volume 1\
    \ |  Issue 1 |  Jul-Aug 2020 \n46 \n \n data to guide both immediate and future\
    \ decision making. \nIt can be implemented in various situations where there is\
    \ \na shortage of rainfall, soil is not fertile, or temperature is \nworse. Precision\
    \ agriculture and data analytics are pushing \nfor a new agriculture input industry\
    \ structure, causing a \nnew set of capabilities to be required.  With precision\
    \ \nfarming, farmers can monitor crop health and other \nnatural events.  They\
    \ can foresee the yields with absolute \naccuracy even before sowing. Farmers\
    \ who implement \nprecision agriculture are gaining unprecedented visibility \n\
    into their operations [17]. \n \n Boosting Productivity and Innovation:   \n\
    Due to increasing global food demand, farmers need to \nharness data and innovation\
    \ to improve productivity \nand feed a growing global population. Implementing\
    \ \nprecision agriculture enables farmers better manage \nkey resources including\
    \ seed, fertilizer, and pesticides, \nwhile increasing productivity. \n \n Managing\
    \ Environmental Challenges:  \nData-driven farming can help make it easier for\
    \ farmers \nto navigate shifts in environmental conditions. \n \n Cost savings\
    \ and Business Opportunities:  \nThe agriculture sector stands to gain a lot from\
    \ data-\ndriven farming.  The resulting savings can help farmers \nbetter manage\
    \ risk against the vagaries of domestic and \nglobal markets. \n \n Better Supply\
    \ Chain Management:  \nThe growing availability of rich data and actionable \n\
    insights will help farmers to trace their products \nthroughout the supply chain.\
    \ Retailers, distributors, and \nother key stakeholders will be able to tailor\
    \ their products \nand services to the needs of the market.  \n \n Risk Assessment:\
    \  \nFarming always involved some risks, such as unexpected \ncrop disease, natural\
    \ disasters, or extreme weather \nconditions, which may be out of the control\
    \ of farmers.  \nWith big data, nearly every system, decision or event can \n\
    be considered in the risk analysis plan. Every mistake can \nbe accounted for,\
    \ along with the appropriate solution. \nFarmers can use real-time data to ensure\
    \ damage remains \nminimal. Big data for risk assessment is applied in \nbenchmarking,\
    \ sensor deployment, analytics, and predictive \nmodeling. Applying these approaches\
    \ to make predictions \nusing big data can help farmers model and manage risks\
    \ \nrelated to raising livestock and growing crops. \n \nOther areas in which\
    \ agriculture uses big data include \ncrop \nmanagement, \nlivestock \ncare, \n\
    supply \nchain \nmanagement, crop forecasting, climate predictions, \nbenchmarking,\
    \ visualization, and food security. \n \nBENEFITS \nBig data is expected to cause\
    \ major shifts in roles among \ntraditional and non-traditional players. It will\
    \ change the \nway farms are operated and managed, real-time \nforecasting, and\
    \ tracking of physical items. Big data has the \npotential to implement the interventions\
    \ needed to reverse \nworrying trends of food insecurity, increase food \nproduction,\
    \ \nand \nimplement \nsustainable \nsolutions. \nAgriculture industry may see\
    \ the biggest efficiency gains \nand improvements from big data and analytics.\
    \ It may be \nthe best way to revolutionize the agricultural sector [18, \n19].\
    \ \n \n \n \nOther benefits of big data in agriculture include [20]: \n \n Provide\
    \ predictive insights to future outcomes of \nfarming and drive real-time operational\
    \ decisions. \n Increase farming productivity.  \n Improve farming operations\
    \ and consumption of \nresources like water and electricity.  \n Create a sustainable\
    \ agriculture that is attractive to \nyouths and future generations.   \n Stop\
    \ migration of the labour force.  \n Reduce food waste.  \n Optimize fleet management\
    \ to increase delivery \nreliability. \n Attract greater investments in agriculture\
    \ industry. \n \nCHALLEGES \nAgriculture is facing many challenges, particularly\
    \ in \ndeveloping nations. Although promising many benefits in \nagriculture,\
    \ big data’s main challenge relies in its \nadoption and how to make the data\
    \ collected relevant \nand useful for farmers. Understanding the best way to \n\
    utilize massive amounts of data remains a major \nimportant challenge. The increasing\
    \ implementation of \nbig data analytics may lead critics to ask whether this\
    \ \ntechnology will eventually replace humans in several \ncapacities. Data bias\
    \ and variance are important \nchallenges to address when developing predictive\
    \ \nalgorithms, which heavily rely on data [21]. Farmers are \nthe most novice\
    \ players in the big data application to \nfarming, particularly those in developing\
    \ nations.  \n \nOther challenges facing big data in agriculture include \nthe\
    \ following: \n \n What will farmers do after agriculture is digitalized \nand\
    \ automated? \n The promise of big data remains largely unfulfilled. \n Data\
    \ access, privacy, security, ownership, and use of \nfarm data.  \n The culture\
    \ of modern agriculture creates some \nsignificant ethical and legal questions.\
    \ \n Power asymmetry between farmers and large \nagribusinesses exists. \n Unequal\
    \ access to and use of information could widen \nsocial inequity. \n Limited\
    \ ICT infrastructure and skills in poorer \nnations may cause the “digital divide.”\
    \ \n \nAlthough the benefits of big data in agriculture have clearly \noutweighed\
    \ the uncertainty, the challenges must be \naddressed for increased uptake of\
    \ big data applications in \nfarming or agriculture. \n \nCONCLUSION \nBig data\
    \ and smart farming are relatively new concepts. \nBig data is inevitable in agriculture.\
    \ Its potential to \n“revolutionize” agricultural industry is of interest to the\
    \ \nindustry and researchers across the world.  The new \ncapabilities \nunderpinning\
    \ \nbig \ndata \ninclude \ncloud \ncomputing, social media, artificial intelligence,\
    \ sensor \ntechnology, the Internet of things, robotics, and mobile \ntechnologies\
    \ [22]. Currently, discussion on big data \napplications takes place mainly in\
    \ Europe and North \nAmerica. However, applications are expected to grow \nrapidly\
    \ in other countries like China and India.  Countries \nthat facilitate usage\
    \ of data-driven agriculture find it easier \nto fulfil the needs of their citizens.\

    Abstract: The agricultural sector is one of the key sectors that need to be transformed
    in order to

    mitigate climate change. The use of predictive models supported by big data (“big
    data predictive

    tools”) has already been named in the literature as one key possibility to facilitate
    this change. This

    contribution maps out the possibilities and potential harms of big data predictive
    tools for sustainable

    agricultural use and analyses the role that regulation can play to address these
    challenges, answering

    the following question: how can the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the
    European

    Green Deal address potential harms of big data predictive tools for sustainable
    agriculture while

    safeguarding its possibilities. Based on a combination of doctrinal legal research
    and a review

    of secondary sources, this contribution concludes that in theory, both instruments
    recognize the

    possibilities of big data predictive tools for agriculture and emphasize the necessity
    of environmental

    sustainability in this regard. However, some of the most promising and essential
    elements of achieving

    sustainable digitalisation in agriculture, risk not being substantiated because
    of a watered-down CAP,

    signiﬁcant focus on larger farms and strong member state margin of appreciation.
    Although at ﬁrst

    sight the CAP and Green Deal seem aligned, it can be concluded that the depth
    has yet to be proven.

    Whether this depth can be substantiated will also determine the extent to which
    digital technologies,

    such as big data predictive tools, will help in enforcing a sustainable agriculture
    or risk intensifying

    unsustainable practices in the EU.

    1. Introduction

    Climate change is one of the greatest challenges to mankind in the 21st century.

    The United Nations (UN) 2020 internet governance forum recognizes the importance
    of

    leveraging artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and big data for environmental sustainability
    and

    climate action [1]. At the same time, the UN acknowledges that there is an urgent
    need to

    identify and address the cases in which these technologies may have adverse environmental

    impacts [1]. The need for a transition towards sustainable and climate-resilient
    food systems

    was more recently recognized and underscored at COP26 [2].

    Agriculture is currently responsible for 10% of total greenhouse gas emissions
    in the

    European Union (EU) [3]. However, at the same time, agriculture plays a role in
    climate

    change mitigation as well. The crops, hedgerows, and trees found on farmland sequester

    carbon, while properly managed soils provide carbon storage [4]. This duality
    characterizes

    the agricultural sector and clearly indicates its vital importance in environmental
    and

    climate policy.

    Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the EU directs the future of agriculture

    in a sustainable way. The prospects of digitalisation enhancing the EU’s agriculture
    are

    also recognized in the Common Agricultural Policy for 2023–2027 (CAP) (Article
    (23),

    Article 6 §1b and Article 6§2) [5]. Sustainable farming has been highlighted in
    the EU

    Green Deal as an essential objective in future European environmental policy [6].

    to Fork Strategy recognizes even more clearly the link between digitalisation
    and achieving

    climate and environmental goals [7]. As such, it serves as a good basis for aligning
    the

    digital and green transitions within the agricultural sector [7].

    One key element of these transitions is the use of predictive models supported
    by big

    data (“big data predictive tools”) [8–14]. Such tools enable the prediction of
    pest and disease

    outbreaks and offer recommendations for better seed placement in ﬁelds and selection
    of

    the best plant varieties [15]. In addition, they allow for enhanced monitoring
    of agricultural

    practices, including impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity [15]. Big data predictive

    tools promise to help farmers make well-informed decisions that improve the quality
    and

    quantity of their production, with less labour and less impact on the environment
    [15].

    These models could stimulate a more precise and sustainable pesticide use, while
    still

    ensuring yield. Moreover, big data predictions can be used to adapt farming methods
    to

    the effects of climate change (weather conditions, pests, soil condition) [15].

    However, big data predictive tools can also be harmful for the environment unless

    they are used in a way that, while often requiring a lot of energy to run, save
    more energy

    by providing more efﬁcient solutions [16]. Therefore, it is necessary to merge
    two pivotal

    debates, one on digital technology and one on sustainable development [16].

    The starting point of this contribution is the prediction that big data predictive
    tools

    will play an increasingly important role in EU agriculture. However, legal research
    into the

    advantages and possible disadvantages of this technology is currently lacking.

    This contribution aims to overcome the limitations of the recent literature about
    the

    application of big data in agriculture and will map out the possibilities and
    potential harms

    of big data predictive tools for sustainable agricultural use. The central question
    under-

    pinning the present contribution can be formulated as follows: “How can EU regulatory

    measures of the CAP and those included in the Green Deal address potential harms
    of big

    data predictive tools for sustainable agriculture while safeguarding its possibilities”.
    The

    objective of this contribution is to shed some much-needed light on big data predictive
    tools

    in a sustainable agricultural context and offer guidance considering the 2023–2027
    CAP

    and implementation of the Green Deal.

    2. Methodology

    The main research question implies both descriptive and evaluative questions.
    Differ-

    ent regulatory possibilities will be identiﬁed to address the possible harms and
    beneﬁts of

    big data predictive tools to a more sustainable agriculture. Subsequently, these
    possibilities

    will be evaluated.

    The methodology to answer the research question will entail a combination of doctrinal

    legal research and a review of secondary sources. An academic literature review
    will give

    insight into big data predictive tools and their speciﬁc application in an agricultural
    context.

    Through doctrinal legal research, relevant legal primary and secondary sources
    will be

    identiﬁed. These primary and secondary sources allow a thorough review of the
    legal

    framework. Doctrinal legal research can encompass an analysis of case law, regulations,

    policy documents, explanatory reports and other legal sources. This methodology
    looks at

    the law within itself and focuses on identifying the current state of the law
    to enable further

    evaluation of the law through a review of secondary literature. The review of
    secondary

    sources will take the analysis further to provide an evaluation of the identiﬁed
    legal body.

    Firstly, general literature on big data predictive tools, doctrine and EU publications

    on agricultural policy and precision agriculture will be consulted to introduce
    big data

    predictive tools and how these tools can be used in the agricultural context.
    Subsequently,

    the possible beneﬁts and harms of these predictive tools will be reviewed.

    Secondly, an overview of the relevant regulatory framework of sustainable agriculture

    and big data tools in the EU will be supported by an in-depth analysis of the
    European

    framework of primary and secondary legal sources. This analysis can contain regulations,

    directives, case law and policy documents. Legal doctrine will be consulted. In
    this regard,

    the CAP and the Green Deal will be reviewed. These two instruments are vital pillars
    of

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    3 of 17

    the regulatory framework for the governance of agriculture in the EU. The CAP
    is a pivotal

    instrument that has been an important column supporting EU agriculture policy.
    The

    Green Deal is the most recent attempt at signiﬁcantly steering EU policy and agriculture

    into a sustainable direction. This contribution is limited to an assessment of
    the regulatory

    framework in the EU. This limitation is based on the fact that the EU is the driving
    force

    for environmental policy and dictates in a substantive way national policy and
    legislation.

    National member state law will not be taken into account as it will be mainly
    based on EU

    legislation.

    Lastly, this contribution will offer an evaluation of the relevant European regulatory

    framework. The evaluation will be mainly based on a literature review. This refers
    to

    the collection of scholarly publications that allow an evaluation of the identiﬁed
    legal

    instruments, de lege lata. Subsequently, this leads to a formulation of how the
    law should

    be, de lege ferenda.

    3. Big Data Predictive Tools for Sustainable Agriculture?

    When applied in the agricultural sector, big data prediction models can help to
    predict

    and manage performance under current conditions, but more importantly, under future

    conditions that cannot be observed in historical data [17]. Researchers have already
    de-

    veloped promising integrative and multi-scale big data models to predict how different

    crop varieties will perform under untested environmental conditions [18]. Both
    agricul-

    tural science and economic-behavioural sciences emphasize that improved acquisition
    and

    use of data is critical for agricultural research and its successful application
    [17]. Better

    data are needed to further improve crop and livestock models in ways that are
    useful

    for both on-farm management decision-making, as well as evaluating productivity
    and

    sustainability [17].

    Private data are being developed by a growing array of management advisory and

    technology companies. Data generated by individual producers or by private ﬁrms
    selling

    data or advisory services are not public and thus not ﬁndable or accessible, often
    even by

    farmers themselves [17]. There are no established data standards being used, and
    thus

    data are not interoperable even when ﬁndable and accessible [17]. There are also
    many

    limitations of currently produced public data. Public data such as weather, price,
    and crop

    yield data, can be open access or available for fees. However, many of the data
    related to

    agricultural production are collected for various government administrative purposes
    and

    are not intended to be used for research or for private decision-making [17].

    Understanding farmers’ decision-making behaviour remains another complicating

    factor. To varying degrees, new technologies such as mobile sensors on farm machinery
    are

    enabling precision management, but it is unclear what criteria are being used
    or should be

    used for management algorithms [17]. In addition, the concrete economic and environmen-

    tal beneﬁts of these technologies remain to be demonstrated [19]. Notwithstanding
    that

    recent technological developments are promising, it is still unclear whether agricultural

    prediction models work well enough to be used for on-farm management prescriptions
    or

    analysis of climate change impacts [17]. Research on next-generation prediction
    models

    concluded that a major limitation is the difﬁculty faced by potential users in
    obtaining

    and interpreting model outputs [17,20]. Even in technologically advanced countries,
    most

    farmers cannot effectively utilize the data becoming available from new digital
    technologies,

    in part because useful predictive models are not readily available. These tools
    have not

    yet been integrated into mainstream agricultural management. In general, adoption
    of

    technological innovations is mainly dependent on the characteristics of the innovation,

    such as cost and complexity, the innovator and his or her socio-economic background

    entailing preferences and educational level of the farmer and the perceived usefulness
    and

    ease of use [21]. This has been conﬁrmed for agricultural innovations [15]. In
    addition, the

    adoption of innovation in agriculture is speciﬁcally highly dependent on the knowledge

    support systems in place [22–24].

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    4 of 17

    Data-driven innovations have already revolutionized several sectors of the econ-

    omy [25]. Agriculture seems to have started falling behind other major industries
    in the use

    of digital technology [26,27]. This can be clariﬁed by the fact that EU agriculture
    involves

    highly diverse, complex systems operated by relatively small businesses. These
    factors

    complicate the use of data science technologies that depend on standardized big
    data

    and make it more difﬁcult to exploit scale economies. Nonetheless, there is a
    high poten-

    tial return on public investment in better data and data infrastructure, in computational

    methods in the agricultural sciences, and in technologies for farm decision-making
    [17,27].

    Small and medium-sized enterprises must also be able to beneﬁt from these technological

    advancements. Special attention should be paid to the needs of these farms [28].
    The

    promise that a data-driven revolution in agriculture may provide beneﬁts is contributing
    to

    a growing interest in the application of ICT in agriculture. Data collection,
    data modelling

    and analysis, and data sharing have become core challenges, an opportunity for
    innovation

    and a growth area for commercial development [26].

    However, whereas there are clear potential beneﬁts of the increased deployment
    of big

    data predictive tools, their potential risks should be adequately researched.
    The European

    Policy Centre warned that increased emphasis on digitalisation within agriculture
    should

    be steered adequately to prevent the increased stimulation of intensive farming
    and the

    optimization of unsustainable farming practices [15]. A major legal challenge
    associated

    with big data predictive tools largely stems from the way of processing large
    amounts of

    information accumulated through a variety of technical means, and the use of decision

    algorithms [15].

    The existing body of literature recognizes big data predictive tools as a part
    of the

    future of agriculture [17,26,29,30]. As is often the case with new technologies,
    big data

    predictive analysis promises great opportunities that are inevitably accompanied
    by daring

    challenges. However, research often consists of economic-behavioural analysis
    and agri-

    cultural science analysis [17,31]. Research from a legal point of view is lacking,
    however.

    Moreover, most of the existing scholarship is not focused on European agriculture.
    The

    creation of an internal market that aims to cover a heterogenous European agricultural

    sector is deeply embedded in EU agricultural policy and legislation. Due to these
    speciﬁc

    characteristics of EU agriculture and, therefore, agricultural policy and legislation,
    it is

    valuable to conduct research that focusses on the EU. Additionally, few publications
    discuss

    environmental sustainability regarding big data predictive tools. Since environmental

    sustainability will be at the heart of future EU agricultural policy, it is necessary
    to explore

    this technology in the context of sustainable agriculture.

    3.1. Big Data Analysis and the Possible Beneﬁts and Harms to Sustainable Agriculture

    With a global population expected to reach 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion
    in 2050 [32],

    the challenge of how to increase agricultural production to achieve food security
    becomes

    more pressing every day [12]. The impact of climate change only ampliﬁes this
    challenge

    and emphasizes the pressing need for a sustainable agriculture [12].

    Precision farming is often regarded as one key approach for linking environmental

    and economic interests in the agricultural sector [33]. Precision agriculture
    is the scientiﬁc

    domain that deals with management of spatial and temporal variability to improve
    eco-

    nomic returns and reduce environmental impact [34]. This entails optimisation
    processes

    of production practices through a variety of technologies, such as site-speciﬁc
    manage-

    ment through data collection from the ﬁeld, data analyses and evaluation, and
    decision

    support [33]. Smart farming entails the use of information and communication technology

    in the farm management cycle [35].

    It is predicted that the next revolution in agriculture will be driven by sustainable

    precision and smart agriculture and the leveraging of technologies such as GPS,
    satellite

    imagery, Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing and artiﬁcial intelligence
    [12]. Big data

    analytics and decision-making will encompass this development [35].

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    5 of 17

    With the ever-increasing amount of digital connections, both in terms of number
    of

    connections and time spent, the volume, velocity and variety of big data is only
    going

    to keep growing [35]. Investment in developing efﬁcient processes and infrastructure
    is

    needed to support these technologies and ensure the efﬁcacy of the data generated
    [36]. Vast

    amounts of data are collected with proximal, aerial or satellite-based sensors,
    in situ sensors

    (soil moisture sensors), on-farm weather stations and instrumented farm equipment.
    This

    qualiﬁes as big data since it entails information assets that are characterised
    by high volume,

    high velocity, and high variety and that require speciﬁc technology and analytical
    methods

    for its transformation into value [37].

    Predictive big data analytics is a technique used in big data analytics that can
    predict

    future outcomes based on gathered data [26]. Big data recommendation tools can
    be

    considered as intelligent application systems to help users with their decision-making
    [38].

    In the agricultural sector, big data recommendation tools use algorithms to analyse
    data

    and make recommendations on crop management [38].

    Agriculture is increasingly knowledge-intensive [38]. Knowledge derived from com-

    bining data from various sources can be used to derive valuable actionable insights.
    At

    the farm level, the farmers of today must deal with a myriad of data to be able
    to make

    livelihood-based decisions on a regular basis [37]. Data on soil health, weather,
    irrigation,

    markets, early-warning systems, diseases and pests, ﬁnance/loan availability,
    as well as

    government-related information/subsidies all come into play in making a decision
    at the

    farm level [37]. At the province or district level, the policymaker has to have
    real-time

    or near real-time information on market prices, projected yield of a particular
    crop at the

    end of the harvest season, beneﬁciaries of government schemes/subsidies, efﬁcacy
    of pre-

    emptive actions to protect against diseases and pests, disaster mitigation and
    much more.

    At the national level, quality data would help design effective policies to assist
    smallholder

    farmers, monitor and remove inefﬁciencies in the value chains, ensure consumers
    about

    quality produce, eradicate hunger and malnutrition, and ensure food security in
    the coun-

    try [37]. At the global level, a coalition including FAO and several national
    governments

    has launched signiﬁcant support to help developing countries gather data on small-scale

    farmers to help ﬁght hunger and promote rural development [39].

    Agriculture, like other ﬁelds, will have the unprecedented capability to extract
    intel-

    ligence and make evidence-based decisions ﬁrmly grounded on real-time, reliable
    data

    and effective analytics. The introduction of new actors in the value chain and
    investment

    in developing the capacities of existing actors will be some of the key challenges
    that

    governments will have to address [37]. Newer ways of harvesting data will lead
    to granular

    insights that previously were impossible to achieve. The FAO urges that “we should
    not miss

    the opportunity to harness actionable intelligence from big data to achieve the
    Sustainable Develop-

    ment Goals. The cost of inaction would be far greater if we do not put in place
    an organizational data

    ecosystem to utilize the wealth of data that we have and to derive valuable insights
    from it” [37].

    An intelligent and widespread use of data coming from sensors and Earth observations

    can substantively change agriculture. The smart use of big data in agriculture
    can increase

    productivity, food security and farmer incomes [40]. Better and intelligent use
    of available

    national and local datasets and data coming from sensors and Earth observations
    can lead

    to a more efﬁcient use of natural resources, such as water and sunlight, in agricultural

    practices [40]. Big data tools can offer farmers access to data in real time to
    adapt their

    agricultural activities. For example, big data tools can provide information on
    their farm

    machinery and historic weather patterns, topography, and crop performance [40].
    In

    this regard, the open data from the European Union’s Earth observation program,
    the

    Copernicus Program, can be of value [40] In addition, some speciﬁc EU big data
    projects

    need to be mentioned. AgroIT is a project that researches the creation of an open
    standard

    IT system that seeks to make agriculture more efﬁcient. It built several tech
    applications on

    farms. Some of these applications collect data from various types of agricultural
    sensors

    and send them to a cloud environment for processing. Other applications access
    those

    data from the cloud environment and make them available to farmers on standard
    smart

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    6 of 17

    phones. Farmers use these applications to monitor their farms and plan their work
    more

    efﬁciently [41]. FOODIE is a research project dedicated to the use and promotion
    of open

    data for agricultural applications. FOODIE aims at enabling in an easy manner
    the (re)use

    of open data in the agricultural domain to create new applications that provide
    added

    value to different stakeholder groups [42]. The EUXDAT is an initiative that aims
    to

    showcase solutions through three pilot applications focused on sustainable agriculture
    and

    development. These will highlight how farmers and decision-makers can use real-time

    actionable intelligence by combining and analysing Earth observation data from
    satellites,

    meteorological information from robotic sensors in ﬁelds, and images from unmanned

    aerial vehicles. The project was ﬁnalized in October 2020 and addressed the relevance
    of

    big data to the Farm to Fork Strategy and a Green CAP [8].

    The European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on Artiﬁcial Intelligence recog-

    nizes environmental well-being as a requirement for trustworthy AI. The potential
    of AI

    systems to help the environment is highlighted [43]. However, the Guidelines stress
    that it

    must be ensured that this occurs in the most environmentally friendly way possible
    [43].

    This encourages an approach to big data predictive tools’ beneﬁts and harms in
    light of

    this recognized sustainability and ecological responsibility [8]. Big data is
    the backbone of

    AI-based applications which can be applied in agriculture for yield prediction
    algorithms

    based on weather and historical yield data and image recognition algorithms to
    detect pests

    and diseases in plants [44]. AI can enable farmers to analyse decades of weather
    and crop

    data and look for patterns to predict crop yields and monitor water and air conditions
    to

    help predict farming problems in speciﬁc regions. To learn new concepts and tasks
    and

    to reason and draw relevant conclusions about the world, AI has to have access
    to big

    data [44].

    3.2. Big Data for Sustainable Agriculture

    The data revolution in farming has given rise to smart farming management infor-

    mation systems. Sources of speciﬁc problems can be identiﬁed and predicted in
    advance

    through the combination of aggregated data from agricultural holdings with relevant

    datasets comprising data on weather, soil conditions, soil moisture and cropping
    inten-

    sity [45]. Predictive tools can be developed to help a farmer with production
    decisions, soil

    management and production insurance options [45]. Big data predictive tools promise
    to

    help farmers make well-informed decisions that improve the quality and quantity
    of their

    production, with less labour and less impact on the environment.

    Big data analysis could stimulate more precise and sustainable pesticide and fertilizer

    use, while still ensuring yield [46]. In this regard, big data predictive tools
    could be an

    important instrument to facilitate a sustainable increase in productivity and
    income for

    farmers and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Predictive models supported

    by big data enable crop prediction and yield prediction [38]. They can be used
    to offer

    recommendations for better seed placement in ﬁelds and selection of the best plant
    varieties

    and predict pest and disease outbreaks [46].

    As the world already grapples with climate impacts, it becomes clear that an important

    policy reality should be addressed: adaptation is necessary and urgent, including
    a need for

    emergency responses to extreme climate impacts as well [46]. Moreover, some of
    the most

    important climate adaptation policies could also be among the most important development

    policies [46]. For example, one way to cut the impacts of climate change on agriculture
    is

    to adopt early warning systems and forecasting systems, so that farmers can adjust
    seeds,

    cropping methods, and planting times to reduce harmful impacts from weather events.

    Implementing those systems makes sense even without the pressing urgency of climate

    change [46].

    Big data predictive tools could fulﬁl an important role in adapting and building

    resilience to climate change. Agriculture is dependent on a predictable and consistent

    climate. Farmers need to be able to plan in advance and make both short- and long-term

    decisions to harvest the best possible yield. Water shortages, droughts, heat
    waves, an

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    7 of 17

    increased and changing occurrence of weeds, and diseases are examples of climate
    change

    consequences that will increasingly impact agriculture and food production [47].
    Big data

    predictive tools can enable farmers to adapt their farming methods to the effects
    of climate

    change and anticipate consequences such as weather conditions, pests and soil
    condition

    for both the short term and long term [46]. Speciﬁcally, these tools could predict
    plagues

    and disease outbreaks, offer recommendations for better seed placement in ﬁelds
    and

    selection of the best plant varieties [46]. Predictive weather tools could allow
    farmers to

    prepare for drought, heat, heavy rainfall and ﬂoods [48].

    To realize these aforementioned opportunities, there is an important legal side
    that

    needs to be addressed. Looking at these opportunities through a legal lens highlights
    sev-

    eral needs. The sustainable development and use of big data predictive tools in
    agriculture

    requires support in the relevant EU legal instruments and efﬁcient implementation
    by the

    member states. These opportunities depend upon equity and a fair, non-discriminatory
    dis-

    tribution of beneﬁts and access [30]. This should be safeguarded by EU legislation.
    In this

    regard, the inclusion of stakeholders is necessary. Understanding farmers’ decision-making

    behavior is an important factor. Small and medium-sized farms must be able to
    beneﬁt from

    these technological advancements, and special attention should be paid to the
    inclusion of

    these farms [17,25]. Shared standards and criteria on data collection and data
    management

    are also an important element in guaranteeing quality data, quality predictions
    and the

    effective realisation of the possibilities of big data predictive tools for sustainable
    agricul-

    ture [17,25]. The realisation of the opportunities is also highly dependent on
    the extent to

    which users can interpret the model outputs. Therefore, it is essential that this
    is recognized

    by EU legislators and that knowledge support systems are established [49].

    In addition, it is crucial that potentially harmful effects of big data predictive
    tools to

    sustainable agriculture are also identiﬁed and considered.

    4. Results and Discussion

    4.1. Big Data, Big Challenges

    Big data shows great potential in the ﬁeld of sustainable agriculture. However,
    it is

    questioned whether big data can capture all the complexities of agricultural systems
    [49].

    Agricultural management can require considering very speciﬁc agricultural proﬁles
    and

    circumstances. Therefore, big data predictive tools cannot always be used across
    farms and

    farming conditions [49].

    This harm can be tempered by investing in the creation of better data, data infras-

    tructure, accessibility and information-sharing and guidance. The lack of criteria
    and

    standards on data quality, collection and management is a legal barrier that enables
    this

    harm. Therefore, it is important that EU legislators develop standards on data
    quality, data

    infrastructure, data security and data management and a shared and accessible
    data space.

    Both large farms and smallholder farms, governments, NGOs, and agro-industry should

    be included and consulted. Different agricultural and climate and environmental
    proﬁles

    for the member states need to be represented. Farmers should be able to access
    guidance

    on how to use and interpret big data analytics output, taking into account their
    speciﬁc

    proﬁles.

    In its 2017 report, the FAO stressed that agricultural chemicals have had “catastrophic

    impacts on the environment, human health and society as a whole” [50]. Regardless
    of how

    efﬁcient industrial agricultural practices may become under new tools, they often
    continue

    to rely on damaging chemical inputs [49]. In big data analytics, the quality and
    quantity of

    the data are essential. In this regard, more data are not always better. In many
    instances,

    aimlessly gathering a broad set of data provides little value, and we will ﬁnd
    ourselves, as

    stated by the FAO, “drowning in data but thirsty for knowledge” [37] Therefore,
    the need

    for good quality data needs to be underscored [37]. Otherwise, the FAO warns,
    we would

    fall into a garbage-in-garbage-out scenario [37]. When the data input is based
    on intensive

    agricultural methods and pesticide and fertilizer use, this can lead to overpredictions
    on

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    8 of 17

    this matter. Again, this harm is enabled by the legal barrier that rises from
    the lack of

    standardization on, for example, data quality and data management criteria and
    guidelines.

    Whether big data is going to serve productivity and sustainability, or productivity
    at

    the expense of sustainability, is an essential question that requires careful
    thought about

    which technologies to fund, how to regulate them, and for whom [51]. It is not
    yet clear

    whether big data tools, and digitized agriculture in general, are going to mostly
    favour

    large-scale, intensive industrial farming [51,52].

    This technology could disadvantage smallholder farmers and lead to a “digital
    di-

    vide” [30,53,54]. However, it also can be argued that smallholder’s disadvantages
    and the

    information asymmetry can be reduced using these applications [55]. Big data predictive

    tools can restrict the farmers’ agency in farm management decisions. Monsanto
    is currently

    the most prominent biotech agribusiness to buy into big data. Sensors on tractors
    are

    able to monitor or dictate every decision a farmer makes, which enables Monsanto
    to

    aggregate large quantities of valuable, previously proprietary farming data and
    unique

    insights on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis [53]. Dependence on large agri-food companies,
    due to

    the concentration of big data technology in their hands, can signiﬁcantly limit
    sustainable

    agriculture [38]. Agro-companies are developing big data tools to assist in crop
    and soil

    management. These services are tied to the products produced by these companies,
    such as

    their chemicals. Monsanto collects real-time data from a farmer’s ﬁelds using
    ground sen-

    sors and then identiﬁes which of its hybrid seeds “best match” to the ﬁeld conditions
    [56].

    The algorithm also recommends Monsanto’s chemical products to be bought as part
    of

    the advice for the complete growing season [57]. This can maintain an excessive
    use of

    pesticides and fertilizers by farmers. These paid services provided by the agro-industry

    collect large volumes of data. However, these data are not publicly available
    and can

    only be obtained through paid subscriptions [18]. Therefore, it is important to
    determine

    carefully which data can be collected to attain environmental goals rather than
    merely

    commercial objectives. Determining which data can remain proprietary versus those
    which

    ought to be opened to meet environmental challenges will require careful decision-making

    in the public and private sector [51]. In this regard, there are pressing key
    questions and

    issues that need to be addressed in the further development of digital technology
    and

    big data in agriculture, speciﬁcally around data ownership, trust, equity, distribution
    of

    beneﬁts, and access [30]. These issues need to be addressed quickly, as otherwise
    the

    decisions would be left to the large agricultural companies, which are already
    investing

    in digitalization, to increase their market power based on their data [51]. generated
    by

    private ﬁrms selling data or advisory services are not public and not ﬁndable
    or accessible,

    often even by farmers themselves. There are no established data standards being
    used, and

    thus data are not interoperable even when ﬁndable and accessible [17]. This forms
    a major

    legal barrier. This can be overcome if EU legislators create data standards and
    a shared,

    accessible data platform. This will enable access to quality and usable data and
    predictions

    serving sustainability and agency for the farmers.

    The aforementioned possibilities and harms of big data predictive tools present
    several

    important legal barriers. The lack of accessible, interoperable, quality, unbiased
    data, the

    exclusion of farmers and smallholder farmers in particular, the lack of data standards

    and data management criteria, and the lack of guidance and education on the use
    and

    interpretation of big data predictive tools are the most prominent practical and
    legal barriers

    that hinder the realisation of the possibilities of big data predictive tools
    for sustainable

    agriculture. The next chapter will identify the relevant legal instruments and
    review to

    what extent the identiﬁed opportunities and harms and the uncovered legal barriers
    are

    addressed.

    4.2. Do the CAP and Green Deal Capture Predictive Tools?

    4.2.1. The CAP

    Since 1962, the EU has provided a common agricultural policy for all member states.
    In

    the words of the European Commission, the CAP is a partnership between agriculture
    and

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    9 of 17

    society on the one hand, and between the EU and EU farmers on the other. This
    common

    policy aims to support European farmers ﬁnancially, improve agricultural productivity
    and

    keep the rural economy viable [58]. In achieving these goals, the protection of
    the climate

    and the promotion of sustainable management of natural resources must be ensured
    [58].

    The CAP has its legal basis in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
    (TFEU),

    which stipulates that the internal market also includes agriculture and trade
    in agricultural

    products and that the EU should deﬁne and implement a common agricultural policy
    [59].

    The CAP has a direct impact on the environment through the ﬁnancing of agricultural

    activities [60]. On 2 December 2021, the agreement on the reform of the CAP was
    formally

    adopted. The new legislation, which is due to take effect in 2023, is supposed
    to “pave the

    way for a fairer, greener and more performance-based CAP” [61].

    A smarter, modernised and more sustainable agricultural policy needs to embrace

    research and innovation in order to serve the multi-functionality of agriculture,
    investing in

    technological development and digitalisation, as well as improving the access
    to impartial,

    sound, relevant and new knowledge Article (23) [5]. Therefore, the CAP identiﬁes
    the

    modernisation of agriculture by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation
    and

    digitalisation as a cross-cutting objective Annex I, [5]. Speciﬁcally, the future
    CAP will

    pursue an increase in competitiveness, including greater focus on research, technology

    and digitalisation, contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as
    well as

    sustainable energy, and foster sustainable development Article 6, [5]. The member
    states

    are expected to describe the elements that ensure the modernisation of agricultural
    policy in

    their national strategic plans. This should, in particular, include their national
    strategies for

    the development of digital technologies in agriculture and for the use of these
    technologies

    to improve effectiveness and efﬁciency Article 114, [5].

    In assessing these national strategic plans, the share of farmers beneﬁtting from

    support for digital farming technology through CAP and the share of farmers receiving

    investment support to restructure and modernise, including to improve resource
    efﬁciency,

    are seen as indicators to assess progress on implementing these CAP objectives
    Annex I R3,

    Annex 14 R9, [5].

    While the general direction is dictated by the Commission, the new CAP mainly
    puts

    the steering wheel into the hands of the Member States. Although the CAP offers
    several

    tools that could support climate smart digitalisation, such as the eco schemes,
    farm advisory

    services, AKIS and rural development measures, the national administrations will
    have the

    ﬂexibility to decide on the ‘how’ of it all.

    In order to stimulate the development of big data analytics and digitalisation
    in

    agriculture across the EU, public funding is essential. Financial resources could
    be an

    important incentive for member states and farmers to make their land and environmental

    data available and implement agricultural technologies in an environmentally sustainable

    way [57]. These ﬁnancial resources should not be the sole responsibility of the
    member

    states [57]. Big data predictive tools can contribute to the development of sustainable

    agriculture. However, digitalisation of agriculture and climate change mitigation
    and

    adaptation are mainly included in the CAP through more general objectives or voluntary

    measures [57].

    The use of big data predictive tools in agriculture could be stimulated under
    eco-

    schemes or rural development payments. However, since these both rely strongly
    on the

    initiative of the member states and farmers, it is uncertain whether big data
    predictive tools

    will be supported at all, let alone in a sustainable context.

    In addition, the CAP primarily supports the largest (most hectares) and most mecha-

    nized farms [45]. This does not meet the needs of sustainable smart farming. Focusing
    on

    the largest farms contributes to the uneven adoption of digital products and services
    in EU

    agriculture [45]. This maintains inequity and inequality as an important legal
    barrier to the

    sustainable adoption of big data predictive tools. Smallholder farms risk being
    excluded

    and falling behind the larger farms.

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    10 of 17

    The current policy framework also lacks means for the combination of large amounts

    of public data on agriculture with private data collected on the farms. The most
    important

    databanks for the CAP function independently from the growing volumes of smart
    farming

    data originated at the farm level. The smart farming data chain is currently mainly
    shaped

    by private contractual agreements between farmers and agricultural technology
    providers.

    These contracts often neglect potentially negative and unsustainable effects of
    the estab-

    lished data ﬂows [45]. Although the EU industry-level code of conduct on agricultural
    data

    sharing promotes transparency and ethical business practices in agricultural data
    harvest-

    ing, collection and use, it does not address broader needs for developing sustainability
    in

    smart farming [45]. In this regard, the ambition of the Farm to Fork Strategy
    to create an

    accessible and interoperable shared data space can address this barrier. However,
    the lack

    of provisions that encourage the industry to tackle unsustainable effects of their
    data ﬂows

    remains an important legal barrier.

    The CAP should include more speciﬁc measures directed towards supporting digitali-

    sation and data production in farms of various types and sizes, with particular
    attention

    to the support of smaller farms [45]. By combining publicly owned databanks along
    with

    aggregated and anonymized smart farming data collected from farmers or purchased
    from

    agricultural technology providers, the smart farming databanks and insights could
    be

    expanded.

    The CAP mainly sets general targets and does not refer to the speciﬁc targets
    of the

    Farm to Fork strategy. If the CAP could offer more speciﬁc sustainable requirements
    for

    implementing (climate smart) digital technologies in agriculture, including leveraging

    big data predictive tools, the realization of the CAP’s objectives to develop
    resilient and

    sustainable farming systems in the EU would be more certain and effective [45].

    Although the CAP does include environment and climate-related measures and pro-

    visions on digitalisation, it seems inadequate to introduce and stimulate a widespread

    sustainable adoption of digital agriculture technologies, such as big data predictive
    tools.

    The rather unspeciﬁc objectives and requirements, the continued focus on larger
    agricul-

    tural holdings, the substantial ﬂexibility for the member states, and implementation
    and

    enforcement issues suggest that the possibilities of big data predictive tools
    will not fully

    reach their potential and that the harms risk not being addressed.

    However, the CAP puts forward many objectives that scope a much wider policy

    than environmental sustainability. As such, it cannot be considered an environmental

    instrument and is not linked to the EU environmental policy. The CAP could change

    course and adopt a more environment-based approach. This would entail rewarding

    environmental services delivered rather than reserving ﬁnances based on hectares
    and

    offering more incentives for farmers to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
    Additionally,

    it should support technologies such as big data predictive tools through farm
    advisory

    services, supply chain development and infrastructural investments with a clear
    focus on

    environmental sustainability. In adopting a more environment-focused approach
    including

    speciﬁc requirements for climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies,
    the CAP

    could play an important role in keeping farmers in business while mainstreaming
    the

    sustainable use of agricultural digital technologies. However, this requires a
    fundamental

    change. With the CAP set for 2023–2027, a full and swift change has become highly
    unlikely.

    Since the road to this CAP was already difﬁcult and full of compromise, the CAP
    might

    prove not to be the appropriate catalyst for the transition of EU agriculture
    needed to deal

    with the environmental crisis and consequences of climate change on agriculture.

    4.2.2. Green Deal

    The Green deal sets direction to a resilient and sustainable agriculture. Concerning

    agriculture, this course of action is reﬂected and substantialized in the Farm
    to Fork

    strategy. The Farm to Fork Strategy is the ﬁrst attempt at a European-wide approach

    to food systems of this scale [62]. Further, in dealing with an EU-wide approach,
    the

    importance of context-speciﬁc solutions is clear in the differing needs, legislative
    set-ups,

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    11 of 17

    and ecoregion types across the member states [62]. Agriculture and nature exist
    in a

    complex and dynamic interdependent system that cannot be understood or protected
    by

    looking at mere components [62]. This complexity must be reﬂected in policy.

    The Farm to Fork Strategy states that farmers need to make “the best of use techno-

    logical and digital solutions to deliver better climate and environmental results,
    increase

    climate resilience and reduce and optimize the use of pesticides and fertilizers”
    [63]. It can

    be pointed out that the Farm to Fork Strategy seems to link the use of digital
    technologies

    to delivering sustainable agriculture goals. In other words, farmers are called
    upon to make

    use of technologies to deliver better environmental results. Therefore, it can
    be questioned

    whether big data predictive tools that are biased to intensive farming methods
    can be

    considered "the best of use". This could offer a promising benchmark to look at
    the use of

    big data predictive tools in agriculture and criticize unsustainable effects.

    The Farm to Fork Strategy strongly recognizes knowledge transfer and advice as
    key

    factors in achieving a sustainable agriculture, 3.2 [63]. Within this context,
    it also states

    that farmers have a particular need for objective, tailored advisory services
    on sustainable

    management choices. Big data predictive tools could offer such service. However,
    following

    the Farm to Fork strategy, it needs to support environmental sustainability, which
    would

    require tackling risks such as bias. Provisions on standardization and data management

    are, in this regard, important factors lacking in the Farm to Fork strategy.

    The development of Big Data analytics platforms is challenging. In this regard,
    lack of

    rural connectivity is a barrier that inhibits digital agriculture. Across many
    rural areas of

    Europe, there is a lack of broadband. The aim of the Commission to accelerate
    the roll-out

    of fast broadband internet in rural areas is promising and would support the uptake
    of

    digital technologies such as big data predictive tools, 3.1 [63]. This commitment
    is, however,

    formulated broadly without any speciﬁc targets. Therefore, it remains to be seen
    to what

    extent this aim will be substantiated within this short time frame.

    The fact that the Farm to Fork Strategy emphasizes the importance of a common

    European agriculture data space can be welcomed. The realization of the possibilities
    and

    mitigation of the harms is dependent on the availability and quality of agricultural
    data. It

    is, therefore, important that the EU will be involved. A shared EU data space
    will support

    the sustainability of EU agriculture through the processing and analysis of production,
    land

    use, environmental and other data, allowing precise and tailored applications
    at the farm

    level, 3.2 [63]. If the Commission succeeds in developing and supporting a European
    data

    space that guarantees both availability and data quality, this will beneﬁt the
    sustainable

    use of big data predictive tools in agriculture. A platform on which both companies
    and

    farmers share and access data can help prevent data concentration and control
    by large

    companies. This would help farmers to maintain their independence [57]. A shared
    data

    space would mitigate some of the most important legal barriers regarding accessibility

    and equity. However, the Farm to Fork Strategy does not mention the need to create
    data

    standards and management criteria. This is important to lift the legal barrier
    of bad data

    quality and interoperability.

    The overarching aim of the Biodiversity Strategy 2030 to bring nature back into

    our lives must, therefore, include bringing nature back into agriculture [62].
    In other

    words, agricultural practices should seek harmony with local ecosystems, and production

    systems should promote biodiversity growth in the region rather than depleting
    it [62].

    However, big data predictive tools risk failing to capture all of these complexities
    [49].

    Agricultural management involves very speciﬁc agricultural proﬁles and circumstances.

    Therefore, it should be carefully assessed whether predictive tools can be used
    across farms

    and farming conditions [49]. In order to cope with this risk, and to align with
    context-

    speciﬁcity highlighted both in the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Biodiversity
    Strategy 2030,

    this assessment should also explicitly consider the local environmental conditions
    and

    ecosystems.

    Packed with ambitious targets, the Farm to Fork Strategy aims to create a “fair,
    healthy

    and environmentally friendly” food system. However, it has been pointed out that
    there is

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    12 of 17

    a gap between the Farm to Fork ambitions and the reality on the ground. In this
    regard, it

    is can be questioned whether the strategy focuses too much on the farmers, rather
    than the

    entire chain [64]. Concerning big data predictive tools, this is especially relevant
    because

    the risk of bias to intensive agriculture and concentration of big data technology
    in the

    industry’s hands are problems situated at industry level rather than farm level.
    The creation

    of data standards for quality and management by EU legislators could offer help.
    However,

    this is lacking in the Farm to Fork Strategy and, therefore, remains a legal barrier.

    Although healthier and affordable food as well as better incomes for farmers are

    objectives, the 2030 quantitative objectives only target agriculture with the
    reduction

    of fertilizer use by 20%, the reduction of pesticides and antimicrobials by 50%,
    25% of

    agricultural land to be used for organic farming and 10% in high-diversity landscapes

    features [63]. The policy and ﬁnancial means to achieve this highly improved ambition

    remain questionable [65]. The Farm to Fork Strategy paints a picture of a future
    where

    digital technology and agriculture are intertwined [66]. It is yet to see whether
    the EU

    legislators will have the necessary courage to allow and stimulate new technologies
    [66].

    Farmers need the right tools to shift to more sustainable practices while maintaining
    their

    economic stability. This is crucial both for farmers and for the environment,
    the climate

    and our rural areas. Consequently, there is a need for strong funding methods
    to promote

    innovation and digitization [66]. It is questioned whether sufﬁcient tools are
    ensured for

    farmers to make the necessary investments and changes for a digital transition
    [64].

    As stated by Norbert Lins, chair of the European Parliament’s Agriculture and
    Rural

    Development Committee, the “Farm to Fork strategy may be a silver bullet, but
    it will not be

    implemented by magic” [66].

    The Farm to Fork Strategy points to research and innovation as key drivers in
    accel-

    erating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems [63].
    To achieve

    these objectives, digital technologies are presented as a steppingstone. The Farm
    to Fork

    Strategy calls upon the Commission to work with member states on strengthening
    the role

    of the European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability

    in the CAP strategic plans. This is seen as an essential step to accelerate innovation
    and

    knowledge transfer. In addition, the Farm to Fork Strategy states that member
    states will

    need to scale up support plans for AKIS and strengthen resources in their CAP
    strategic

    plans to develop and maintain appropriate advisory services needed to achieve
    the Green

    Deal objectives and targets [63]. The Farm to Fork Strategy considers research,
    innovation

    and knowledge transfer as pivotal to establish a green and digital transformation
    of EU

    agriculture. In relation to ﬁnancial investments, the Farm to Fork strategy also
    refers to the

    CAP. It requires the CAP to increasingly facilitate investment support to accelerate
    the green

    and digital transformation of agricultural holdings [63]. This is important, considering
    that

    the Farm to Fork Strategy has been criticized as falling short in allocating ﬁnancial
    means

    for the sustainable and digital transition of agriculture [64].

    It is remarkable that the Farm to Fork Strategy refers these essential elements,
    at least

    in part, to the CAP. This points to how the CAP must be interpreted within the
    Green Deal

    framework, and to what extent it can be considered a Green Deal instrument. The
    Commis-

    sion expressed that it remains fully committed to a reformed CAP delivering the
    Green

    Deal objectives. As the Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans and Commissioner
    for

    Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski will engage in support of ﬁnalizing the negotiations,
    the

    Commission set up a dedicated task force to ensure a whole-of-government approach
    and

    provide all necessary support for an ambitious outcome [67]. This is a sign that
    the CAP is

    a Green Deal policy [67].

    It should be pointed out that by referring to the CAP, the extent to which these
    goals

    will be achieved becomes dependent on the success of the CAP. This can be uncertain
    and

    differentiated since the future CAP places signiﬁcant power with the member states
    to

    implement the CAP based on local needs. Member states have already started to
    devise

    their National Strategic Plans to implement the future CAP. Coordinating and aligning

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    13 of 17

    the 27 National Strategic Plans with the Green Deal objectives remains a considerable

    challenge [65].

    With the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Green Deal aims to build a sustainable food
    system,

    safeguarding a new and better balance of nature, food systems and biodiversity,
    protecting

    people’s health and well-being, and at the same time increasing the EU’s competitiveness

    and resilience [63]. The CAP seeks to increase competitiveness, including a greater
    focus

    on research, technology and digitalisation, Article 6(b) [5], contribute to climate
    change mit-

    igation and adaptation, Article 6(d) [5], as well as sustainable energy, and foster
    sustainable

    development. An efﬁcient sustainable food system needs policy coherence across
    these

    different objectives. Fragmented governance could lead to delays in policy implementation

    and threaten progress [62]. In addition, a sustainable food system is one that
    reframes

    efﬁciency so that it means food systems deliver proﬁts, healthy diets, and a healthy
    planet,

    rather than trade, yield (increasing), and price (decreasing) policies [68]. With
    a multitude

    of objectives, it is uncertain whether the CAP corresponds with the Green Deal,
    which puts

    sustainability at the forefront of future EU agricultural policy with a Farm to
    Fork Strategy

    that highlights the link between digitalisation and achieving climate and environmental

    goals.

    5. Conclusions

    The data revolution in farming has given rise to a signiﬁcant opportunity for
    big

    data predictive tools to tackle the environmental and climate crises in agriculture.
    Predic-

    tive tools could potentially be deployed to help farmers with production decisions,
    soil

    management and production insurance options [15]. Big data predictive tools promise

    to help farmers make well-informed decisions that improve the quality and quantity
    of

    their production, with less labour and less impact on the climate. These models
    could

    stimulate a more precise and decreased use of pesticides and fertilizers, while
    still ensuring

    yield [46]. In this regard, big data predictive tools could be important instruments
    to

    facilitate the sustainable increase in productivity and income for farmers and
    the reduction

    of greenhouse gas emissions. Big data predictive tools could fulﬁl an important
    role in

    adapting and building resilience to climate change as well. They can enable farmers
    to

    adapt their farming methods to the effects of climate change and anticipate consequences

    such as drought, heat, extreme weather, ﬂoods, diseases and plagues.

    However, this contribution showed that big data predictive tools, as such, do
    not guar-

    antee a more sustainable agriculture. In this regard, some speciﬁc risks were
    highlighted.

    It is questionable whether big data can capture all the complexities of agricultural
    sys-

    tems [49]. In addition, it is important to point out that regardless of how efﬁcient
    industrial

    agricultural practices may become under new technologies, they often continue
    to rely on

    damaging and excessive chemical inputs [49]. When the data input is based on intensive

    agricultural methods and pesticide and fertilizer use, this could lead to unsustainable

    recommendations on this matter. To avoid this scenario, the need for good quality
    data

    needs to be underscored. Otherwise, big data predictive tools, and digitized agriculture
    in

    general, might very well merely favour large-scale, intensive industrial farming
    [49,69].

    In addition, this technology could disadvantage smallholder farmers, lead to a
    digital

    divide, and further a power asymmetry [53] Big agro-chemical companies are already

    investing in big data analysis to increase their market power [53].

    Dependence on large agri-food companies, due to the concentration of big data
    tech-

    nology in their hands, can signiﬁcantly limit the beneﬁts of this technology for
    sustainable

    agriculture [38].

    Tackling these risks of big data predictive tools while still leaving room for
    the ad-

    vantages to ﬂourish will require careful decision-making in both the public and
    private

    sectors [51]. Agriculture and nature exist in a complex and dynamic interdependent
    sys-

    tem. Neither agriculture nor nature can be understood or protected by looking
    at mere

    components [62]. Smart agriculture technologies such as big data predictive tools
    have

    Sustainability 2022, 14, 12968

    14 of 17

    the potential both to support or damage this complex dynamic. Here, the importance
    of

    steering this technology within a strong policy framework comes to play.

    To answer the research question on how the EU CAP and Green Deal address potential

    harms of big data predictive tools while safeguarding their possibilities, one
    can conclude

    that, at least in theory, both the Green Deal [63] and the CAP, Article (23),
    Article 6,

    Article 114, Annex I [5] recognize the possibilities of digital technologies such
    as big data

    predictive tools for agriculture and emphasize the necessity of environmental
    sustainability

    in this regard [70]. However, some of the most promising and essential elements
    of

    achieving sustainable digitalisation in agriculture risk not being substantiated
    because of a

    watered-down CAP, signiﬁcant focus on larger farms, and strong member state margin
    of

    appreciation. Although at ﬁrst sight, the CAP and Green Deal might seem aligned,
    and the

    intention might well be there, it can be concluded that their depth has yet to
    be proven [62].

    Whether this depth can be substantiated will also determine the extent to which
    digital

    technologies, such as big data predictive tools, will help enforce a sustainable
    agriculture

    or merely intensify unsustainable practices in the EU.

    By tackling the barriers and weak links concerning data ownership, data security,
    data

    quality and standards, equity, distribution of beneﬁts and access, EU legislators
    can address

    the harms while safeguarding the possibilities of big data predictive tools for
    sustainable

    agriculture. In doing so, the use of big data analysis in agriculture should be
    aligned and

    linked with the EU environmental targets and climate protection.

    These ﬁndings have several important implications. The CAP has put the steering

    wheel mainly into the hands of the national administrations, and most the national
    strategic

    plans are submitted for the Commission to assess. These ﬁndings can offer a benchmark
    and

    raise public awareness to increase pressure on national administrations and the
    Commission

    to take the Green Deal’s ambitions to heart, and with it, the sustainable digitalisation
    of

    agriculture. The Green Deal sets the EU agricultural policy for years to come.
    Pointing out

    these ﬁndings early on can be helpful for future legal initiatives within this
    framework.

    However, several issues remain unresolved. This implies the great importance of

    continuing research on this topic. Further research should follow up on the national

    strategic plans and the Commission’s assessment and review to what extent sustainable

    digitalisation is stimulated. Research mapping out the risks and possibilities
    of big data

    analytics for sustainable agriculture in the context of the EU data strategy is
    also required.

    Further, it should be highlighted that the extent to which big data analytics
    can facilitate

    an appropriate response to agricultural sustainability standards, such as integrated
    pest

    management, offers fertile ground for further research, in particular considering
    the revision

    of the Sustainable Pesticides Directive [62].

    The ﬁndings presented in this contribution are of vital and timely importance.
    Big

    data predictive tools are a double-edged sword that can either be an ally or an
    enemy in

    ﬁghting the environmental crisis and climate change. Agriculture and food production

    are responsible for signiﬁcant greenhouse gas emissions [3,71,72]. At the same
    time, the

    agricultural sector is increasingly suffering from the adverse impact of climate
    change [4,73].

    Substantial damage due to climate change will increasingly occur and will cause
    reduced

    yields as a result of drought, heat, extreme weather, ﬂoods, increases in disease
    and plagues.

    We need to make the most of this timely opportunity to realize a more interconnected

    approach to agriculture, digitalisation and environmental sustainability. Courageous
    and

    ambitious EU policy and member state implementation are needed now, to provide
    food

    security for many generations to come. With the CAP putting the member states
    at the

    forefront and the Green Deal as a vague policy backbone, the course is set until
    2027.

    \ State University \n2023 \n \ni \nAbstract \nAs the digital economy continues\
    \ to grow and data becomes increasingly important, \neffective data governance\
    \ is essential. A data governance framework enables the efficient \nmanagement,\
    \ sharing, and integration of data, resulting in better decision-making, \nincreased\
    \ productivity, and enhanced innovation across industries, including agriculture.\
    \ \nHowever, the agricultural sector in the United States is lagging behind other\
    \ industries in \nthe adoption of effective data governance practices. Agricultural\
    \ data governance presents \na unique set of challenges due to the wide range\
    \ of stakeholders involved and the ever-\nincreasing volume of data generated\
    \ by digital technologies in farming. One key challenge \nto achieving the benefits\
    \ of effective agricultural data governance is the lack of a robust \npolicy framework.\
    \ \nTo address this issue, this doctoral dissertation utilizes a rigorous policy\
    \ analysis \nmethodology to examine the current data governance policy frameworks,\
    \ identify gaps and \nareas for improvement, and propose a comprehensive policy\
    \ framework for agricultural \ndata governance. The proposed policy framework\
    \ is informed by the policy analysis and \ndesigned to be adaptable and scalable\
    \ to meet the changing needs of the digital economy \nand the agriculture sector.\
    \ It addresses the challenges posed by the ever-increasing volume \nof agricultural\
    \ data and aims to enhance the digital transformation of the agriculture sector.\

    \ 144 \n \n1 \nIntroduction \nIn today's digital economy, data governance plays\
    \ an increasingly vital role. A well-\ndesigned data governance framework facilitates\
    \ efficient data management, sharing, and \nintegration, leading to improved decision-making,\
    \ increased productivity, and enhanced \ninnovation across industries, including\
    \ agriculture. However, compared to other industries, \nthe agricultural sector\
    \ in the United States has been slow to adopt effective data governance \npractices.\
    \ This is due to the unique challenges presented by agricultural data governance,\
    \ \nincluding a diverse range of stakeholders and the growing volume of data generated\
    \ by \ndigital farming technologies. \nOne of the primary barriers to realizing\
    \ the benefits of effective data governance in \nagriculture is the lack of a\
    \ robust policy framework. To address this issue, this doctoral \nresearch provides\
    \ a policy analysis aimed at creating a comprehensive policy framework \nto enhance\
    \ agricultural data governance in the United States. The goal of this study is\
    \ to \nidentify opportunities to improve agricultural policies for the digital\
    \ transformation era. \nCurrently, digital technologies in farming range from\
    \ satellite-guided tractors to seed-\nselecting algorithms and crops developed\
    \ with gene-editing techniques (Bunge, 2021, p. \n3). These new technologies are\
    \ anticipated to increase productivity and drive a more \nsustainable and efficient\
    \ agriculture industry. While digital technologies are an important \ncomponent\
    \ of the agricultural sector's digital transformation, relying solely on them\
    \ is not \nsufficient for complete digitalization. \n \n2 \nEvery nozzle, pump,\
    \ valve, tank, and motor are equipped with sensors that can collect \nlarge amounts\
    \ of data as part of their regular operations (Featherstone, 2021, p. 1). For\
    \ \nexample, “…the amount of data generated per day by average farm exceeded 250\
    \ 000 data \npoints in 2015.” (Kosior, 2019a, p. 4) and an increase in agricultural\
    \ data generation is \nexpected “to exceed 2 million data points per day by 2030.”\
    \ (Kosior, 2019, p. 5). Data can \nbe combined from satellite maps, drone images,\
    \ routine soil samples, and weather and \nclimate reports. \nData generated from\
    \ all these technologies play a crucial role. Effective governance of \nthe large\
    \ amounts of agricultural data and recognizing its value, is essential to enhance\
    \ \nagriculture outcomes and maximize the sector's economic benefits. The digital\
    \ \ntransformation of agriculture involves boosting the sector's ability to not\
    \ only produce and \ngather data, but also to exchange and utilize data in new\
    \ and innovative ways. (Jouanjean \net al., 2020, p. 6). Therefore, farmers and\
    \ producers must view data as a potential strategic \nasset for their farms and\
    \ the industry as a whole.  \nIn the United States, there are various challenges\
    \ to the digital transform the agriculture \nsector, and use agricultural data\
    \ in smart agriculture1. For instance, Mr. Creighton’s corn \nfarm in Eleroy,\
    \ Illinois (Bunge, 2021, p, 1) is representative of farms that faces challenges\
    \ \ndue to the rise of digital technologies and the vast amount of data they collect.\
    \ As reported \nin the Wall Street Journal on August 22, 2021, one of the significant\
    \ difficulties that U.S. \n \n1 “The digitalization of agriculture involves the\
    \ development, adoption, and iteration of digital \ntechnologies in the agricultural\
    \ sector; what has been referred to as both digital agriculture (preferred in\
    \ \nAustralia and New Zealand) or smart farming (preferred in the European Union)\
    \ in different spatial \ncontexts.” (Fielke et al. 2020, p.3) \n \n3 \nfarms currently\
    \ face is working with agricultural technology providers (ATPs)2 to govern \n\
    data. \nIn this case, Mr. Creighton signed a contract with provider Indigo Agriculture\
    \ Inc. \nIndigo’s original concept was to “reshape the agriculture industry” (Bunge,\
    \ 2021, p.2) \nusing cutting-edge technology and a data platform to connect farmers\
    \ with buyers and get \nthe best prices in the market. They also marketed special\
    \ microbes to enhance seed \nproductivity, and farmers had the option to sell\
    \ their products at guaranteed premium prices \nthrough their program. Indigo’s\
    \ business strategy was to create a cluster of digital \nagricultural data platforms,\
    \ from seeds, to an online marketplace, and transport logistics. \nHowever, Mr.\
    \ Creighton faced difficulties, such as a large amount of paperwork, short \n\
    response times to his requests and concerns, and payment delays. This led to growing\
    \ \nmistrust of Indigo Inc. by Mr. Creighton.  \nSimilar to Mr. Creighton, many\
    \ farmers in the U.S. are encountering challenges with \nATPs entering the business\
    \ market and focusing on collecting agricultural data. One such \ncompany is Agrian\
    \ Inc., based in California. Agrian Inc. provides farmers with the tools to \n\
    comply with federal and state pesticide and chemical regulations and offers platforms\
    \ for \nharvest, application, and planting maps. Growers utilize these services\
    \ to create fertility \nrecommendations or to aggregate data to address agronomic\
    \ needs based on the maps. \n(Featherstone, 2021, p. 1) However, the ability to\
    \ aggregate agricultural data has raised \n \n2 Agricultural Technology Providers\
    \ (ATPs) could be categorized into nine main categories: farm \nmanagement software,\
    \ precision agriculture and predictive data analytics, sensors, animal data, robotics\
    \ \nand drones, smart irrigation, next gen farms, marketplaces, plant data/analysis.\

    \ \n \n4 \nconcerns among farmers about data ownership, privacy and security as\
    \ well as the flows \nof data sharing. \nAnother challenge faced by U.S. farmers\
    \ is the lack of accessible digital tools for \nrepairing digital farming equipment.\
    \ As noted at a small cattle farm in Cape Girardeau, \nMissouri, (O’Reilly, 2021),\
    \ the farmer, Mr. Hovis struggled to find software tools needed \nto sync a new\
    \ part to his tractor. The cost of acquiring the necessary technology for repairs\
    \ \nwas just as high as the farm itself. To address this issue, Mr. Hovis filed\
    \ a right-to-repair \nbill in January 2021, and many other farmers across the\
    \ United States are also pushing for \n“right to repair” laws that would require\
    \ manufacturers to provide easy access to tools, \nsoftware parts, and documentation.\
    \ This effort is gaining support from state farm bureaus, \nfarmers unions3, and\
    \ lawmakers from both parties in states like Florida, Montana, and \nNebraska\
    \ (O’Reilly, 2021). \nThe challenges faced by farmers like Mr. Creighton and Mr.\
    \ Hovis, highlight the \ndifficulties that U.S. farmers encounter with technology\
    \ and data in the modern agriculture \nindustry. Despite the benefits of technology\
    \ and data in improving farming efficiency, \ngoverning agricultural data remains\
    \ a critical issue that needs to be addressed. The situation \nof Mr. Creighton\
    \ with ATPs and Mr. Hovis with software tools demonstrate the need for \n \n3\
    \ On January 2023, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and John Deere signed\
    \ a \nmemorandum of understanding that guarantees farmers' right to repair their\
    \ own farm equipment (AFBF, \n2023). This agreement was the result of years of\
    \ discussions between the two organizations. The MOU \noutlines a plan to address\
    \ farmers' concerns and John Deere promises to work with farmers and dealers to\
    \ \nresolve any issues that arise, while also committing to bi-annual evaluations\
    \ with the AFBF. The MOU \ngrants farmers access to repair codes, manuals, product\
    \ guides, and the ability to purchase diagnostic tools \ndirectly from John Deere.\
    \ The manufacturer also offers assistance with ordering parts and products. This\
    \ \nagreement could serve as a blueprint for other manufacturers, and AFBF has\
    \ already initiated talks for the \nsame. However, the John Deere - AFBF MOU is\
    \ a non-binding agreement between one equipment \nmanufacturer and one group representing\
    \ farmers in the U.S. (National Farmers Union, 2023). \n \n5 \nfarmers to have\
    \ more control over the technology they use and access to necessary \ninformation\
    \ to repair their equipment. This reflects the ongoing tensions in the agriculture\
    \ \nindustry between the benefits of technology and the challenges of data governance\
    \ and \nmaintenance. \nFigure 1 highlights the history of innovation in the agricultural\
    \ sector and showcases \nthe challenges faced by U.S. farms in adapting to the\
    \ changing methods and technologies \nduring the process of digital transformation.\

    \ ways to make farming more efficient, sustainable, \nand profitable (OECD, 2019a,\
    \ p. 21). The incorporation of digital technologies and data \ncollection in the\
    \ form of smart agriculture allows the sector to advance these efforts and \n\
    overcome some of the challenges faced by farmers and producers. By embracing digital\
    \ \ntransformation, the industry can use data to make better decisions, increase\
    \ productivity, \nreduce waste, and reduce negative environmental impacts. The\
    \ key is to ensure that the \ndata generated is effectively managed and that farmers\
    \ and producers can access and use it \nin ways that benefit both themselves and\
    \ the larger sector. \nThe FAO's Status Report on Digital Technologies in Agriculture\
    \ and Rural Areas states \nthat the growth of the market will be driven by the\
    \ gradual integration of advanced and \ninterconnected digital solutions, along\
    \ with the rise of big data analytics (Trendov, et al. \n2019, p.80). This highlights\
    \ the fact that the implementation of smart or digital agriculture \nnot only\
    \ requires a significant investment in digital tools and technology but also a\
    \ shift in \nthinking5 to address the new challenges brought about by data and\
    \ its usage. \nAdditionally, farmers are concerned about data ownership, privacy,\
    \ and security, which \nhighlights the need for clear and concise policies on\
    \ data sharing and use in the agricultural \nsector. This is especially important\
    \ in the context of the U.S., where there is a growing \nmarket of ATPs that aim\
    \ to aggregate and use farm data. Farmers need to understand the \n \n5 The shift\
    \ to digital agriculture requires not just the use of new technology such as drones,\
    \ sensors, or \nmobile apps, but also an increase in farmers' data literacy. Farmers\
    \ must learn to manage and govern their \ndata to fully realize its potential\
    \ benefits, including reducing risk and improving production efficiency. \nThey\
    \ must go beyond simply following technology recommendations and understand how\
    \ the data \ncollected can benefit their farming practices and the entire agricultural\
    \ value chain. This shift involves a \nchange in traditional farming methods and\
    \ requires an investment in learning and understanding data and \nits use in agriculture.\
    \ \n \n7 \nflow of data and be confident that their data will not be misused or\
    \ exploited. A well-\ndesigned policy framework will help to mitigate these concerns\
    \ and ensure that the benefits \nof smart agriculture and digital technologies\
    \ are effectively leveraged for the benefit of \nfarmers and the overall agricultural\
    \ sector. \n \n \n8 \nChapter 1: Research Question and Methods  \nThe aim of this\
    \ chapter is to identify the existing gaps in research and to investigate the\
    \ \nrole that a policy framework could play in enhancing the digitalization process\
    \ of \nagriculture in the United States. The focus is on how a well-designed policy\
    \ framework \ncould contribute to the sustainable development of modernized farming\
    \ practices through \nthe use of digital technologies. The primary research question\
    \ addressed in this study is:  \nWhat is the most effective policy framework for\
    \ governing agricultural \ndata to promote sustainable farm modernization through\
    \ digital \ntransformation? \nIn this context, the term \"sustainability\" refers\
    \ to not only the economic sustainability \nof farms (i.e., their ability to remain\
    \ profitable and sustainable operations), but also the \nenvironmental and social\
    \ sustainability of the agricultural sector as a whole. Although these \nvarious\
    \ aspects of sustainability require different types of agricultural data, this\
    \ research \nproject assumes that high-quality data is required for each aspect's\
    \ policy-making and \nsocial action. Because this project addresses the primary\
    \ question of how to establish a data \ngovernance system, the question of how\
    \ data can be applied to different aspects of \nsustainability is left to future\
    \ research. Sustainability represents the long-term impact that \nagricultural\
    \ data governance aims to achieve. However, this research focuses on the \npreceding\
    \ outputs of interest, which are the production and sharing of high-quality data\
    \ \nand the subsequent outcome of interest, which is the cost-effective digitization\
    \ of the \nagricultural sector. \nThe primary research focus of this study is\
    \ to examine the general issues related to data \npractices and contractual complexities\
    \ in the agriculture sector at the national level in the \n \n9 \nUnited States.\
    \ The study also looks at cross-sector data governance practices and compares\
    \ \nthem with international approaches. Additionally, the research addresses the\
    \ sub-question \nof what type of policy framework can effectively balance the\
    \ interests of various \nstakeholders while addressing the benefits and risks\
    \ of increased data access in the U.S. \nagricultural sector. \nResearch Gap \n\
    In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the amount of data generated\
    \ \nby agricultural activities in the United States. According to a report by\
    \ the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), the amount of data generated\
    \ by precision agriculture \ntechnologies in the country is expected to grow by\
    \ 20% per year, reaching a total of 4.1 \nmillion terabytes by 2050 (USDA, 2019).\
    \ This represents a massive opportunity for the \nagriculture sector to improve\
    \ its efficiency, productivity, and sustainability, as well as to \ncreate new\
    \ business models and revenue streams. However, to fully realize the potential\
    \ of \nthis data, it is necessary to establish a governance framework that promotes\
    \ data sharing, \nprotects data privacy and security, and addresses the technical\
    \ and legal challenges \nassociated with the use of agricultural data.  \nThis\
    \ study recognizes that there is a lack of consensus in the U.S. regarding the\
    \ \nmechanisms that can ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the flow\
    \ of agricultural \ndata. Currently, there are no legally binding frameworks in\
    \ place to govern the use and \nmanagement of agricultural data, leading to a\
    \ need for a comprehensive policy framework \nto address these issues.  \n \n\
    10 \nResearchers such as Sanderson et al. (2018) and Wiseman (2019) have explored\
    \ the use \nof codes of practice (COPs) as a means of addressing the legislative\
    \ gaps in the regulation \nof agricultural data practices (Sanderson et al., 2018)\
    \ in the U.S. and other countries where \nthey are considered enforceable. However,\
    \ despite the efforts of COPs to promote \nresponsible data practices in the agriculture\
    \ sector, there is a lack of evaluation of \ncompliance with the core principles\
    \ of these codes, which presents a significant challenge. \nNot all agriculture\
    \ service and technology providers, as well as farmers and producers, \nparticipate\
    \ in the collective efforts to implement the codes of agricultural data practices.\
    \ \nAs a result, it is unclear whether these codes have been successful in promoting\
    \ accountable \ndata practices and trust between technology providers, farmers,\
    \ and producers. The \nparticipation rate in these codes and its impact on the\
    \ trust relationships between \nstakeholders is not well understood.  \nAdditionally,\
    \ the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is in the process of \nupdating\
    \ its agricultural data infrastructure systems (Ristino & Hart, 2022). Discussions\
    \ \nare ongoing about the need for the USDA and its agencies to undergo institutional\
    \ changes \nto support the digital transformation of agriculture. Implementing\
    \ such changes would \nrequire a comprehensive understanding of data sharing,\
    \ use, and reuse at a macro-level, \nand would necessitate collaboration from\
    \ all stakeholders involved. \nThe situation presented above highlights the potential\
    \ risks and benefits of policy \ndecisions that could impact the digital transformation\
    \ of the agriculture sector, and the lack \nof comprehensive analysis or proposals\
    \ for a data governance framework specific to this \nsector. While COPs have been\
    \ explored as a means of promoting responsible data practices \n \n11 \nin agriculture,\
    \ the lack of evaluation of compliance and participation rates of stakeholders\
    \ \npose significant challenges. \nAs there is limited literature available on\
    \ a public policy, legal, or regulatory framework \nfor governing agricultural\
    \ data practices, particularly in the United States, this research \naims to fill\
    \ this gap in the literature and in the fields of policy analysis and public policy.\
    \ \nThe goal is to facilitate meaningful changes that encourage and support efficient,\
    \ secure, \nand accurate data sharing across stakeholders in the agriculture sector.\
    \  \nThis research aims to provide a comprehensive policy framework for governing\
    \ \nagricultural data practices by conducting a policy analysis and proposing\
    \ policy \nalternatives that have the potential to significantly improve agricultural\
    \ data practices. The \nfocus is on establishing standards for data usage at the\
    \ macro, meso, and micro levels to \nencourage efficient, secure, and accurate\
    \ data sharing among agriculture sector \nstakeholders. \nA comprehensive policy\
    \ framework for governing agricultural data practices could lead \nto improved\
    \ efficiency, reduced costs and a lower environmental impact in the agriculture\
    \ \nsector. It can serve as a valuable resource for policymakers and stakeholders\
    \ in considering \noptions for improving the governance of agricultural data.\
    \ However, it is important to note \nthat the implementation of a prescriptive\
    \ policy framework (Sanderson et al., 2018, p. 7) \nmay face challenges such high\
    \ costs, and difficulty in reaching agreement among all \ninterested stakeholders,\
    \ including government agencies, agriculture service and technology \nproviders,\
    \ farmers, and producers. Despite these limitations, this research aims to \n\
    contribute to the sector and to public affairs by offering a valuable policy framework\
    \ for \n \n12 \ngoverning agricultural data practices that would be acceptable\
    \ and implementable by all \ninterested parties in the agriculture sector.  \n\
    The complexity of the task is compounded by the need to balance the competing\
    \ \nconcerns of different stakeholders and address the benefits and risks of enhanced\
    \ access to \ndata. The challenge of reaching agreement and implementing a comprehensive\
    \ policy \nframework highlights the need for a collaborative and inclusive process\
    \ that takes into \naccount the perspectives and interests of all stakeholders.\
    \  \nOntology \nAdopting a structuralist analysis approach to govern agricultural\
    \ data means \nacknowledging the power structures that shape incentives and constraints\
    \ for different \nactors within the agricultural sector. This involves recognizing\
    \ that the role of structures \n“[is to] exercise causal powers by providing an\
    \ environment of incentives and prohibitions \nfor various agents within a social\
    \ system.” (Little, 1991, p. 104). This approach seeks to \nensure that the control,\
    \ access, sharing, and use of agricultural data by all stakeholders \nleads to\
    \ a fair and equitable outcome. By examining the various elements and components\
    \ \nof the agricultural data governance process, the goal is to promote a system\
    \ that is \nbeneficial to all parties involved. \nAs stated by Little (1991, p.\
    \ 105) the “incentives and constraints imposed by the social \nstructure will\
    \ have predictable consequences for the choices that individuals will make.” It\
    \ \nis therefore necessary for the state and its institutions to step in and implement\
    \ trustworthy \nsystems to govern agricultural data in the U.S. \n \n13 \nFigure\

    representation of the relationship between macro and micro foundational connections.\
    \ It \nserves as a structural explanation and provides insight into the intention\
    \ driving this \nresearch6.  \nFigure 2 The Explanatory Cycle \n \nDiagram elaborated\
    \ by the author \nThe social system of agricultural data governance (Ag-DG) is\
    \ institutionalized as a \npolicy framework, with norms for sector participation\
    \ playing a crucial role at the meso \nlevel. Individual decisions to participate\
    \ and share data within the framework are driven by \ntrust, transparency, and\
    \ legitimacy. This leads to a more stable and effective agricultural \nsector,\
    \ resulting in improved products and services. \n \n6 In this research, the epistemological\
    \ approach adopts inductive reasoning to create knowledge by \nobserving, from\
    \ a comparative perspective, particular case studies. Creating knowledge by induction\
    \ might \nbe open-ended and the appearance of new evidence can modify the initial\
    \ conclusion. However, this could \nbe also positive since it gives the possibility\
    \ to feedback policy frameworks to adapt and incorporate \nchanges and new knowledge.\
    \ \n \n14 \nPolicy Science versus Social Science \nPolicy science, as elucidated\
    \ by Goodin et al. (2006), endeavors to supply policy actors \nwith useful information\
    \ for the purpose of providing policy advice. The objective of policy \nstudies\
    \ is action-oriented and aimed at contributing to the improvement of life by offering\
    \ \npolitical actors something that they can put into use (Goodin et al. 2006,\
    \ p. 5). Policy \nscience seeks to address questions regarding what ought to be\
    \ done, as opposed to what it \nis. On the other hand, social science seeks to\
    \ uncover laws and generalizations and provides \npolitical-institutional designs\
    \ as instruments of collective values (Goodin et al. 2006). In \ncontrast, policy\
    \ science focuses on what can be achieved collectively through and within \ninstitutional\
    \ frameworks. \nIn this research, the findings of policy analysis are not intended\
    \ to be general statements \nabout the theme under research, but specific prescriptions\
    \ intended to assist policymakers. \nTherefore, the policy science approach does\
    \ not take a deductive approach but rather an \ninductive one. Policy studies\
    \ stress an aspiration toward relevance7 along with the role of \nvalue premises8\
    \ in policy choice (Goodin et al. 2006)9. This research design does not \n \n\
    7 Policy studies is a multidisciplinary field that investigates the decision-making\
    \ processes involved in \npublic policy. In this context, \"relevance\" refers\
    \ to the importance of ensuring that policy decisions are \nbased on evidence\
    \ and are responsive to the needs and values of society. The idea is that policies\
    \ should be \ngrounded in the best available knowledge and research, and should\
    \ be tailored to the specific needs of the \npeople and communities affected by\
    \ them. \n8 Value premises, on the other hand, refer to the underlying moral and\
    \ ethical principles that shape policy \ndecisions. These may include ideas about\
    \ social justice, individual rights, environmental sustainability, and \nother\
    \ ethical considerations that are important to policymakers and society as a whole.\
    \ \n9 Goodin et al. (2006) argue that policy studies should take both relevance\
    \ and value premises into \naccount when analyzing policy choices. By doing so,\
    \ policymakers can make more informed decisions that \nare grounded in evidence\
    \ and aligned with the values and priorities of society. This approach recognizes\
    \ \nthat policy choices are not purely technical or objective, but are influenced\
    \ by a range of social, cultural, \nand political factors, and by the values and\
    \ beliefs of the people involved in making those choices. \n \n15 \naddress the\
    \ general question of what kind of policy framework will tend to cause \nimprovements\
    \ in agricultural data governance and thus of agricultural outcomes but only \n\
    the context-specific question of what kind of policy framework should be implemented\
    \ as \noptimal for agricultural data governance in the United States. \nIn addition,\
    \ this research seeks to gain an understanding of not only farmers' \nperspectives\
    \ on the value and use of agricultural data, but also the perspectives of other\
    \ \nstakeholders involved in the sector. The objective of conducting policy analysis\
    \ is to assist \ndecision-makers in determining the desired outcomes and the most\
    \ feasible means of \nachieving those goals (Schneider, 1997, p. 9) through the\
    \ implementation of public policy. \nPolicy plays a mediating role in resolving\
    \ conflicts and fostering compromise among \nconflicting interests. It endeavors\
    \ to establish an optimal structure that would provide \nsuitable incentives to\
    \ stakeholders, thus overcoming challenges such as mistrust, lack of \ntransparency,\
    \ and information asymmetry risks.  \nThis study specifically examines the relationship\
    \ between stakeholders such as farmers, \nas data primary contributors, and third-party\
    \ agriculture technology providers, with a focus \non resolving the conflicts\
    \ arising from agricultural data usage. The aim is to create a \nstructure that\
    \ facilitates collaboration and establishes a long-lasting and trustworthy \n\
    relationship between farmers, producers, tech and service providers.  \nResearch\
    \ Design and Methods \nAs stated by Dunn (2018, p. 3), policy analysis is a comprehensive\
    \ and interdisciplinary \nprocess aimed at the production, critical evaluation,\
    \ and dissemination of policy-relevant \nknowledge. The methods of policy analysis\
    \ are designed to address the intricate nature of \n \n16 \nthe policy-making\
    \ process. This study proposes a multi-method strategy (Peters & \nFontaine, 2020,\
    \ p. 14) that aims to understand the problem at hand through the examination \n\
    of tangible and verifiable facts and information. \nThis research utilizes policy\
    \ analysis methods to structure the problem, design policy \noptions, and forecast\
    \ policy proposals. These methods are considered as tools for creating \nand transforming\
    \ knowledge (Dunn, 2018, p. 8). Table 1 presents an overview of the policy \n\
    analysis methods selected for this research. \nTable 1 Methods of Policy Analysis\

    \ chapter is to analyze publicly available \npolicy documents related to data\
    \ governance from a comparative perspective in order to \nidentify valuable lessons\
    \ and best practices. This chapter discusses the different approaches \ntaken\
    \ in the U.S. and other countries to solve the agricultural data governance problem.\
    \ \nThese existing data governance policies serve as the basis for developing\
    \ three policy \nalternatives. This step includes consolidating the gathered information\
    \ to provide a \ncomprehensive analysis and designing policy options to solve\
    \ the agricultural data \ngovernance problem in the U.S. \nChapter 4: Policy Proposal:\
    \ In this chapter, this research then proceeds to project the \nfeasibility and\
    \ effectiveness of these three policy options in the context of the U.S., and\
    \ \npropose a two-stage solution, that moves from minimal to moderate models.\
    \ The chapter \nthen evaluates the policy options using criteria such as cost-effectiveness,\
    \ political \nfeasibility, and costs and benefits analysis to choose a preferred\
    \ policy option.  \nIn conclusion, policy analysis methods serve as effective\
    \ means of evaluating and \nproposing \"potential solutions to practical problems\"\
    \ (Dunn, 2018, p. 3), including those \nrelated to agricultural data governance.\
    \ These methods aid in accurately defining the policy \nproblem. This research\
    \ draws on a comparative policy lesson-drawing approach to identify \nviable options\
    \ for designing the three most appropriate policy alternatives. The evidence \n\
    from comparative cases is used to project the feasibility and effectiveness of\
    \ each model \nin the U.S. context while balancing the competing demands of various\
    \ stakeholders. \n \n19 \nChapter 2: The Policy Problem \nThis chapter will address\
    \ the nature and scope of the agricultural data governance policy \nproblem. It\
    \ will build on the previous chapter by presenting a detailed and well-structured\
    \ \nmodel of the policy problem. To achieve this, this research uses three methods\
    \ of problem \nstructuring. The chapter concludes with a preferred model of the\
    \ policy problem. This \nmodel will serve as the basis for formulating policy\
    \ options in Chapter 3. This chapter also \nincludes the description of the context\
    \ covering agricultural data and the data governance \nframework, which serves\
    \ as background information to structure the problem in the \nagriculture sector\
    \ in the U.S. \nAgricultural Data and Data Governance \n▪ \nAgricultural Data\
    \ \nData can be understood as a representation of factual information in various\
    \ formats, \nincluding numerical, textual, visual, or audio forms (Abraham et\
    \ al. 2019). On many \noccasions, data has been described as a valuable commodity,\
    \ similar to oil, that can \ncontribute to economic growth and development (Benfeldt\
    \ Nielsen, 2017, p. 120). Unlike \noil, however, data is a renewable resource\
    \ that can be continuously used and leveraged for \nmultiple purposes.  \nTo realize\
    \ the full potential of data, it is crucial to understand the contextual information\
    \ \nthat provides value to the data. According to DAMA-DMBOK (2015), context refers\
    \ to \nthe data's representational system. For instance, in the agricultural sector,\
    \ data has the \npotential to drive better decision making, increase farm profitability,\
    \ and promote \n \n20 \nsustainability by aggregating and analyzing various data\
    \ sources, such as seed yields, input \nrates, and product pricing (Séronie, 2020).\
    \ \nAgricultural data classification encompasses a wide range of categories, including\
    \ \nlivestock data, land data, agronomic data, climate data, and equipment data,\
    \ among others. \nIn some cases, this type of data may be linked to personal information\
    \ about farmers. Land \ndata, for example, may include information such as the\
    \ farmer's name, address, and \nfinancial information such as bank loans (Wiseman\
    \ & Sanderson, 2019). It is critical to \ndistinguish between data streams in\
    \ the agri-food chain10, depending on whether they are \nrelated to pre-planting\
    \ or consumption activities. \nOne of the difficulties in determining the origin\
    \ of agricultural data is determining \nwhether it is generated on-farm or off-farm,\
    \ especially when it is generated on-farm \nthrough a third party, such as an\
    \ agriculture technology provider (ATP). This lack of clear \ndistinction may\
    \ lead to confusion regarding the ownership and control of this type of data.\
    \ \nThe classification criteria for agricultural data also include how and why\
    \ the data is \ngenerated (Jouanjean et al., 2020). In this regard, Jouanjean\
    \ et al. (2020) classified how \nagricultural data is generated into three categories:\
    \ process-mediated, machine-generated, \nand human-sourced. Traditional business\
    \ data generated as a result of processes that \nmonitor and record business events\
    \ of interest falls under the purview of process-mediated \n \n10 This distinction\
    \ is important because different types of data may require different levels of\
    \ protection or \nregulation. For example, data related to pre-planting activities,\
    \ such as land data, may be more sensitive \nand require more protection because\
    \ they can be linked to personal information about farmers. On the other \nhand,\
    \ data related to consumption activities, such as nutritional information, may\
    \ require more transparency \nand regulation to ensure food safety and consumer\
    \ protection. Therefore, understanding the different types \nof data in the agri-food\
    \ chain and their associated risks and benefits is crucial for developing effective\
    \ \npolicies and regulations for agricultural data governance. \n \n21 \ndata\
    \ (Jouanjean et al. 2020). Machine-generated data, on the other hand, is generated\
    \ \nautomatically by computer-based digital devices, tools, and applications that\
    \ have grown \nin importance with the rise of precision farming11. Finally, human-sourced\
    \ data refers to \nhuman-created records, such as those found in books, photographs,\
    \ audio, and video \n(Jouanjean et al. 2020). \nThe second criterion for classifying\
    \ agricultural data is based on its primary reason why \n(purpose), which is to\
    \ assist farmers in making informed decisions. For instance, \nagriculture data\
    \ is used by the private sector to develop and support new services and \nactivities,\
    \ while agricultural data is used by public institutions to inform their innovation\
    \ \npolicies and activities (Jouanjean et al. 2020). \nIn the agriculture sector\
    \ of the U.S., data is used in two contexts: public and private big \ndata. On\
    \ the one hand, public-level big data, according to Stubbs (2016), refers to records\
    \ \ncollected, maintained, and analyzed through publicly funded sources and federal\
    \ agencies, \nsuch as farm program participant records and weather data. Private\
    \ big data, on the other \nhand, includes records generated at the production\
    \ level by farmers and agriculture \ntechnology providers, such as yield data,\
    \ soil analysis, irrigation levels, livestock \nmovement, and grazing rates. Both\
    \ public and private big data are useful in agriculture. \nThey provide a more\
    \ accurate picture of agricultural operations, making them a better \ndecision-making\
    \ tool. \n \n11 The increased in data generation that could provide insights for\
    \ making informed-farming decisions, \nneed specialized regulation considerations.\
    \ \n \n22 \nThis study uses the agricultural data taxonomy proposed by Jouanjean\
    \ et al. (2020), \nwhich focuses on what data is generated and how it is collected.\
    \ Jouanjean et al. (2020) \nclassify and categorize agricultural data, dividing\
    \ it into three broad typologies: farm \nbusiness operations and management data,\
    \ farm production process tracking data, and data \ncollected to provide general\
    \ agricultural services. \nThis research incorporates Stubbs' (2016) distinction\
    \ between private and public data, \nwhich relates to the why of data generation.\
    \ This analysis identifies key agricultural data \nthat farmers and other stakeholders\
    \ should be aware of. Table 2 summarizes the various \ntypes of agricultural data,\

    \ \nAdapted from Stubbs (2016) \nIn the United States, the collection and use\
    \ of public agricultural data is governed by a \nnumber of statutes and guidance\
    \ documents that establish not only data quality standards \nbut also privacy\
    \ protection requirements. When collecting data, the USDA and its affiliated \n\
    agencies generally prioritize confidentiality, transparency, and public access.\
    \ However, as \nStubbs (2016, p. 5) points out, one of the major challenges for\
    \ public agricultural big data \nis a constrained federal budget, reduced staffing\
    \ levels, and a lag in the adoption of new \ntechnologies. These factors have\
    \ all had an impact on federal agriculture agencies’ ability \nto collect, govern\
    \ and manage data effectively. \nThe collection, sharing, and use of agricultural\
    \ data present various challenges for the \nUSDA, as noted by Ristino and Hart\
    \ (2022, p. 3). These challenges include the absence of \nopen data standards,\
    \ inconsistent system interoperability, misaligned incentives for farmers \nto\
    \ provide data, leadership and governance gaps, and inconsistent legal authority\
    \ and \n \n27 \ninterpretation within the agency. Figure 5 depicts the various\
    \ USDA agencies12 that require \nfarmers to report their data in order to participate\
    \ in programs like soil conservation. \nHowever, the current reporting requirements\
    \ impose a burden on farmers, as they are \nrequired to report their data to multiple\
    \ USDA agencies (Sanderson et al., 2018), and this \nissue has yet to be resolved.\

    \ benefits \nassociated with this, including improved soil quality and more efficient\
    \ use of water \nresources. The ability to collect, process, and analyze agricultural\
    \ data in real time provides \nadditional benefits as well as new business opportunities.\
    \ \nAccording to Stubbs (2016), the use of these advanced technologies has created\
    \ an ever-\nchanging landscape of information sources and stakeholders. However,\
    \ the complexity of \nthe data collection process, as well as the involvement\
    \ of numerous private players, pose \nsignificant challenges in the private agricultural\
    \ data sector.  \nData standardization, interoperability, accuracy, and privacy\
    \ concerns are just a few of \nthe key challenges. According to Stubbs (2016,\
    \ p. 11), one of the most pressing challenges \nconfronting the private agricultural\
    \ data sector is data privacy, and producers must ensure \nthat their data is\
    \ secure and protected from unauthorized access. Furthermore, data \nstandardization\
    \ is an important issue because it ensures that the data gathered can be \naccurately\
    \ compared and analyzed across multiple sources and stakeholders. \nThe network\
    \ that facilitates communication among the technologies involved is another \n\
    critical aspect of data collection. This network is commonly referred to as the\
    \ \"Internet of \nThings\" (IoT), which refers to a network of interconnected\
    \ objects that communicate with \none another and with computers via the Internet\
    \ (Stubbs, 2016, p.8). This area is subject to \ncontinuous development and evolution\
    \ due to the dynamic nature of the technologies \ninvolved in the data collection\
    \ stage. \nFurthermore, the use of cloud computing to store and process data has\
    \ grown in \npopularity because it provides a cost-effective solution for data\
    \ storage and management \n \n30 \n(Stubbs (2016, p. 8). With the rise of cloud\
    \ computing, producers have gained greater \ncontrol over their data collection,\
    \ management, and analysis. They can also share their data \nwith other farmers\
    \ and agricultural industry stakeholders. However, this presents \nchallenges,\
    \ such as ensuring data security, privacy, and data ownership. The rapidly \n\
    changing landscape of the data collection stage in private agriculture big data\
    \ highlights \nthe importance of a comprehensive and adaptable policy framework\
    \ that ensures \nresponsible data collection and use in the agriculture sector.\

    Manufacturers \nManufacturers of traditional farm equipment (e.g., \ntractors)\
    \ are well positioned to expand into data \ncollection technologies. In many cases,\
    \ technology is an \nextension of the equipment already in use. \nChemical Companies\
    \ and \nApplicators \nChemical companies are playing an increasing role in the\
    \ \nresearch and development of data collection tools and \nmethods to improve\
    \ application use of nutrients and \npesticides. \nMulti-Use Technologies \nTechnologies\

    \ are exploring the use \nof radio frequency identification (RFID), commonly \n\
    used in the shipping and transportation industries, to \ntrack movement, production,\
    \ feed, and disease outbreaks \nin herds.  \nAdapted from Stubbs (2016, p.8) \n\
    \ \n31 \nPrivate agricultural big data management encompasses the processes of\
    \ organizing, \nadministering, and governing large amounts of data (Stubbs, 2016,\
    \ p. 9). The goal of data \nmanagement is to ensure high-quality data that is\
    \ easily accessible to end users. This stage \nof the agriculture industry is\
    \ rapidly growing, with an increasing number of actors \nproviding flexible solutions\
    \ for mid-sized and small-scale farmers/producers. These actors \neither collect\
    \ and organize data for a fee or serve as data brokers, trading and selling data\
    \ \n(Stubbs, 2016, p. 9). Table 6 summarizes some of the most common data management\
    \ \npractices and providers. \nTable 6 Data Practices and Providers \nImportant\
    \ stakeholders \nData management practices \nProducers \nProducers are the primary\
    \ data generators in the \nagricultural sector. They have traditionally stored\
    \ their \ndata locally, either on their own computers or on physical \ndata storage\
    \ devices. However, some are now beginning \nto explore cloud-based storage options\
    \ that offer greater \nconvenience and accessibility. Producers are also \nincreasingly\
    \ interested in data analytics and using data to \nimprove their farming practices.\
    \ \nData Collectors \nData collection and management companies offer a \nvariety\
    \ of services to producers, including data collection, \nstorage, and analysis.\
    \ Many of these companies are \naffiliated with other agricultural products such\
    \ as \nequipment, seed, or chemicals. Data collectors often \nprovide value-added\
    \ services such as benchmarking and \npredictive analytics. \n \n32 \nIndependent\
    \ \nAgricultural Data Banks \nThese are private companies that specialize in data\
    \ \nmanagement and analysis for the agricultural sector. They \noffer a range\
    \ of services, including data storage, analysis, \nand reporting. Data banks generally\
    \ operate on a \nsubscription or fee-for-service basis, and their clients \ninclude\
    \ both producers and other agricultural \nstakeholders. \nData Cooperatives \n\
    These are producer-owned organizations that pool \nmembers’ data to create economies\
    \ of scale and generate \nadditional value and negotiating power. Data cooperatives\
    \ \noffer a variety of services, including data storage, \nmanagement, and analysis.\
    \ They also provide members \nwith access to benchmarking data and other industry\
    \ \ninsights. Many data cooperatives anonymize data before \nselling it to interested\
    \ parties in order to protect members’ \nprivacy. \nAdapted from Stubbs (2016,\
    \ p.9) \nThe final stage of the process is the use of private agricultural data.\
    \ In this stage, the \nvalue of the data for producers is realized. Typically,\
    \ data sets are analyzed and packaged \nin a usable and understandable format.\
    \ Stubbs (2016, p.10) distinguishes three types of \nanalytical products: descriptive,\
    \ prescriptive, and predictive data products. Table 7 lists the \nprimary users\
    \ of these data products. \nTable 7 Users of Agricultural Data \nImportant stakeholders\
    \ \nUses/users of private ag data \nFarmers and Ranchers \nProducers who own the\
    \ data can benefit from big data \nproducts that offer improved production such\
    \ as lower \ncosts, increased yields, or reduced inputs. \n \n33 \nRetailers \n\
    Retailers create big data products by analyzing data, \npackaging it into a usable\
    \ and timely product, and selling \nit to the producer. \nIndustry Groups \nNational\
    \ commodity and agricultural industry groups \nprovide guidance on licensing language\
    \ and data \ncontracts, especially related to producer concerns \nregarding privacy,\
    \ security, and ownership. \nEnvironmental Interests \nThe use of private agricultural\
    \ big data can result in \npositive environmental effects such as reduced inputs\
    \ \n(e.g., fertilizer, pesticides, and water) and increased \nefficiencies (e.g.,\
    \ reduced air emissions through reduced \ntillage overlap). \nAdapted from Stubbs\
    \ (2016, p.10) \nConsequently, private corporations are leveraging the use of\
    \ meteorological, soil, and \nfield-based information to assist farmers in determining\
    \ crop yield-limiting conditions and \nmaking production-related decisions. Furthermore,\
    \ certain entities are using cutting-edge \nmicrobiology and technology to improve\
    \ crop robustness and accelerate the growth of \ncarbon markets (Ristino & Hart,\
    \ 2022). Moreover, agricultural machinery manufacturers \nhave embraced new technologies\
    \ and integrated the most recent tractors and harvesters into \ncloud systems,\
    \ allowing for the collection of real-time data from the field for future use.\
    \ \nHowever, it has been noted that the USDA's efforts to collect, integrate,\
    \ and use data to \nimprove farmer outcomes and agricultural program performance\
    \ have been hampered \n \n34 \n(Ristino & Hart, 2022), and that much of the large\
    \ amounts of data collected to address \nvarious agriculture-related missions\
    \ remains unused15 (Ristino & Hart, 2022). \nTo summarize, the use of private\
    \ agricultural data is becoming more common, and the \nbenefits are becoming more\
    \ apparent. Private agricultural data has the potential to \nrevolutionize the\
    \ way farmers make production decisions, from increased yields and lower \ncosts\
    \ to improved soil quality and water availability. However, challenges remain,\
    \ such as \ndata ownership and privacy concerns, high costs of precision tools\
    \ and equipment, and \nmarket competition. Despite these obstacles, private companies\
    \ are using cutting-edge \ntechnologies such as IoT, drones, and sensors to collect,\
    \ manage, and analyze data in order \nto provide solutions to farmers. Furthermore,\
    \ while the USDA's data collection efforts have \nbeen limited, private companies\
    \ are stepping up to fill the void, providing innovative \nsolutions that can\
    \ improve farmer outcomes and performance. Figure 7 shows the \ndistribution of\
    \ agricultural data in the United States and highlights the key players \ninvolved.\
    \ The figure illustrates the absence of governance data infrastructures tools\
    \ or \n \n15 There is no single source of data that provides a comprehensive view\
    \ of how much agricultural data in \nthe U.S. is being used. However, there have\
    \ been various studies and reports that suggest that while there is \na significant\
    \ amount of agricultural data being collected, much of it is not being fully utilized\
    \ or shared. For \nexample, a 2018 report by the USDA found that while the majority\
    \ of farmers were collecting data on their \noperations, many were not using it\
    \ to make management decisions. Similarly, a 2019 survey by the \nAmerican Farm\
    \ Bureau Federation found that while most farmers were using some type of precision\
    \ \nagriculture technology, many were not fully utilizing the data collected by\
    \ these technologies. Overall, \nthese studies suggest that while there is a significant\
    \ amount of agricultural data being collected, there may \nbe untapped potential\
    \ for its use in improving agricultural productivity and sustainability. USDA\

    \ ag data in the U.S. \n \nDiagram elaborated by the author \nIn the context of\
    \ analyzing agricultural data in the United States, it is necessary to \ndescribe\
    \ the data value chain. The term \"value chain\" refers to the steps taken to\
    \ \nincrementally add value and produce a final product or outcome (Brown, 2020,\
    \ p. 4). A \ndata value chain describes the information flow from raw data to\
    \ valuable insights in the \ncontext of big data systems (Cavanillas et al., 2021,\
    \ p. 29). This concept can be used to \norganize data activities and transform\
    \ processes into a series of steps that add value to data. \nThe definition of\
    \ an agricultural data value chain will aid in addressing challenges in \nagricultural\
    \ data governance in the context of agriculture's digital transformation. It entails\
    \ \n \n36 \nmanaging and coordinating data in a continuous flow from data generators\
    \ to decision-\nmakers16, which will aid in agricultural data governance (Miller\
    \ & Mork, 2013, p. 57). \nFigure 8 presents a data value chain adapted for the\
    \ purposes of this research, which \nencompasses six stages that can be grouped\
    \ into phases and potentially divided into sub-\nphases. \nFigure 8 A Data Value\
    \ Chain \n \nAdapted from Kosior (2019) \nThe utilization of a data value chain\
    \ in agriculture plays a crucial role in optimizing the \ntransformation of raw\
    \ data into valuable information. This process of transforming data \ninto smart\
    \ data involves the incremental addition of value at various stages of data input\
    \ \nactivities, data processing and transformation, and finally the generation\
    \ of high-quality \nand accurate data products (Brown, 2020, p.4). Currently,\
    \ the governance of agricultural \ndata value chains in the United States is primarily\
    \ governed by private contracts and \nagreements (Fisher & Streinz, 2021, p. 73),\
    \ which are complex in nature and provide data \nproducers or farmers with limited\
    \ negotiation power. \n \n16 Given this data cycle conceptual framework, in the\
    \ current digital and technological global context, the \neconomic dynamic is\
    \ becoming more data-driven when it comes to make decisions. This is what known\
    \ as \ndata economy. One of the main challenges “the data economy faces today\
    \ is the insufficient level of data \nsharing between public and private actors.”\

    \ \nData governance is defined by DAMA International (2015, p. 67) as the “exercise\
    \ of \nauthority and control (planning, monitoring, and enforcement) over the\
    \ management of \ndata assets.” The concept of governing data refers to the decision-making\
    \ processes \ninvolved in data management, as well as the expected data-related\
    \ behaviors and responses \nof individuals and processes (DAMA 2015, p. 68). Data\
    \ governance thus entails the \ncreation of a systematic decision-making framework\
    \ that outlines the various roles and \nresponsibilities associated with data\
    \ access. The goal is achieving organizational or sectoral \nobjectives such as\
    \ improving operational efficiency, mitigating risks, and gaining market \nadvantages\
    \ (Benfeldt et al., 2020, p. 301). \nFurthermore, data governance is frequently\
    \ described as a comprehensive system that \nincludes fundamental attributes or\
    \ characteristics. According to the Data Governance \nInstitute (DGI), as cited\
    \ in Al-Ruithe et al. (2019, p. 840), data governance is defined by \ndecision\
    \ rights and responsibilities regarding information-related procedures that are\
    \ \ncarried out in accordance with established models that specify who is authorized\
    \ to execute \nspecific actions with specific data, when, under what conditions,\
    \ and using what methods. \nFor the purposes of this doctoral dissertation, data\
    \ governance is defined as a \ncomprehensive system that includes decision-making\
    \ authority and accountability for \nmanaging data assets, with a focus on controlling\
    \ the flow of data by regulating its access, \nusability, quality, and security.\
    \ This definition includes the roles and responsibilities of \nnetwork members,\
    \ rules and processes, principles or standards that facilitate data practice \n\
    \ \n38 \ncoordination, and common goals. In this dissertation, the overarching\
    \ goal of data \ngovernance is to ensure that data is managed effectively as a\
    \ valuable asset. \n▪ \nData Governance Policy Framework \nThe World Bank's World\
    \ Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives (WDR21) \n(World Bank, 2021)\
    \ presents a data governance framework that outlines the legal and \nnormative\
    \ safeguards and enablers required to promote trust and foster the growth of a\
    \ \ndata-driven economy. WDR21 and Chen (2021) define safeguards as “norms and\
    \ legal \nframeworks that aim to protect the rights of individuals and entities\
    \ participating in the data \neconomy by addressing misuse of data or data breaches”\
    \ (Chen, 2021, p. 4). And enablers \nare defined as “norms and laws that facilitate\
    \ the use and reuse of data, such as data \nportability mechanisms and open data\
    \ legislation, (Chen, 2021, p. 4). Figure 9 illustrates \nthese two pillars as\
    \ critical components in creating an efficient data governance \nenvironment and\

    \ help to ensure data quality \nwhile also ensuring its secure and open use. As\
    \ the agricultural sector continues to \ndigitalize its farming practices, agricultural\

    \ agricultural data practices. The sector can ensure that \ndata is managed responsibly\
    \ and that its value is maximized while potential risks are \nminimized by implementing\
    \ effective data governance practices. \nUntil now, contractual agreements have\
    \ primarily governed the management of \nagricultural data. Contractual agreements\
    \ define the conditions under which data can be \ncollected, shared, and used\
    \ by farmers, producers, and digital technology providers. These \nagreements\
    \ define the parameters for data use and the extent to which data can be shared\
    \ \nwith third-party service providers, as well as the consequences of data misuse\
    \ or \nunauthorized access. These contracts, according to Casalini and Gray (2020),\
    \ determine \ndata sharing permissions and data ownership following contract termination.\
    \ According to \nMicheli et al. (2019), power imbalances and power relations can\
    \ have an impact on \ngovernance processes and value creation.  \nThese scholars\
    \ argue that civic society and public bodies play an important role in \ndemocratizing\
    \ data governance and redistributing value through data. This implies that, in\
    \ \naddition to addressing technical aspects of data governance, it is also necessary\
    \ to consider \nthe roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, as well\
    \ as how power dynamics and \ninformation asymmetries between them can affect\
    \ data governance in agriculture. \nAccording to Micheli et al. (2019), agricultural\
    \ data governance requires an examination \nof stakeholders' roles and responsibilities,\
    \ as well as the processes and mechanisms used \n \n45 \nas data strategies to\
    \ access, share, and use data. Thus, effective data governance in \nagriculture\
    \ needs not only addressing software, digital applications, or data platforms,\
    \ but \nalso power dynamics and information asymmetries between farmers and agricultural\
    \ \ntechnology service providers. \nThe Sense of Problem \nIn the United States,\
    \ the governance of agricultural data is currently an unstructured \nproblem,\
    \ meaning that it is a recently explored and discussed issue with various key\
    \ actors \nstill deliberating ideas. The issue of contractual agreements is a\
    \ particular challenge, \nresulting in low trust and tensions between farmers,\
    \ industry professionals, and \nagribusiness (Cue et al., 2021). Furthermore,\
    \ challenges associated with the transition from \nanalog to digital and smart\
    \ farming, as well as the generation of large amounts of \nagricultural data,\
    \ present additional difficulties. \nThe problem situation at hand is the digitalization\
    \ of agriculture18, which involves the \nadoption of innovative digital technologies\
    \ like artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, drones, \nand robotics to optimize\
    \ agricultural production systems, value chains, and food systems. \nHowever,\
    \ the growing reliance on digital tools in agriculture has resulted in disagreements\
    \ \nand tensions between farmers and agriculture technology providers, particularly\
    \ regarding \nagricultural data monetization (Cue et al., 2021, p. 11). This issue\
    \ has yet to be fully \nstructured, as agricultural data governance is a relatively\
    \ new concept being explored and \ndebated by key actors in this field. \n \n\
    18 The adoption, use, and adaptation of digital farming technologies in agriculture\
    \ daily practices.  \n \n46 \nIn the United States, the Code of Practice (COP)\
    \ and its fundamental principles \nrepresent an initial move towards establishing\
    \ reliable systems for the flow of agricultural \ndata that safeguard privacy\
    \ and security. Nonetheless, due to its voluntary and non-binding \nregulatory\
    \ nature, as well as the lack of evidence demonstrating its impact and outcomes\
    \ \nin promoting beneficial data practices for all stakeholders in this sector,\
    \ the it proves \ninsufficient to govern data in the agricultural industry. \n\
    There is a growing concern among farmers regarding the ambiguous use of data that\
    \ \narises from the implementation of digital farming technologies. The various\
    \ stakeholders \ninvolved, including farmers, agriculture tech providers, and\
    \ other agribusinesses, hold \ndifferent perspectives on the value of data and\
    \ its potential benefits. \nFarmers’ associations in the United States, for example,\
    \ have created data cooperative \nplatforms, while agribusinesses provide mobile\
    \ application services for data analysis. The \nAgriculture Network Information\
    \ Collaborative (AgNIC)19 is an example of an institution \ncooperating voluntarily\
    \ in the field of agricultural information and data management. \nAdditionally,\
    \ there are private business companies that deal with the storage and analysis\
    \ \nof agricultural data, including but not limited20 to the Agriculture Data\
    \ Coalition (ADC), \nFarmers Business Network (FBN), Growers Information Services\
    \ Coop. (GiSC), Open Ag \n \n19 AgNIC webpage: agnic.org \n20 Others, such as\
    \ the National Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research (NCFAR) (www.ncfar.org),\
    \ \na nonpartisan, consensus-based, and customer-led coalition or the Agricultural\
    \ Research Data Network \n(ARDN) (https://agmip.github.io/ARDN/). The goal of\
    \ ARDN is to build a distributed network for \nharmonized crop system research\
    \ data and make it available through existing data portals like the USDA's \n\
    Ag Data Commons. It provides researchers with tools and protocols that allow them\
    \ to not only share their \ndata, but also make it interoperable and reusable.\
    \ \n \n47 \nData Alliance, the National Agricultural Producers Data Cooperative\
    \ (NAPDC), and Ag \nTransparent. \nAgricultural data issues have been recognized\
    \ as a public concern in the United States \nand have been incorporated into legislative\
    \ policy-making agendas. Senators Amy \nKlobuchar and John Thune introduced the\
    \ Agricultural Data Act (Ag-Data Act) (115th \nCongress, 2017-2018) as an example\
    \ of how senators began to address agricultural data in \n2018. Senator Klobuchar\
    \ proposed that by using appropriate data collection, review, and \nanalysis methods,\
    \ knowledge of how conservation practices impact farm and ranch \nprofitability,\
    \ such as crop yields, soil health, and other risk-reducing factors, could be\
    \ \nexpanded (Thune et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the Agricultural Data Act Bill\
    \ makes no \nmention of the different types of data practices that exist in agricultural\
    \ data contracts \n(Janzen, 2018b). It is difficult to evaluate or \"determine\
    \ the precise information that will \nbe collected, how the USDA will obtain it,\
    \ and who will have access to, use, or share it\" \n(Janzen, 2018a). \nThe absence\
    \ of legal regulations to govern data sharing and usage in the U.S. \nagricultural\
    \ sector has raised concerns among farmers from specific agricultural industries\
    \ \n(Cue et al., 2021). For example, in response, farmers from the dairy industry,\
    \ are calling \nfor the introduction of legislation, proposing a \"Farmers Bill\
    \ of Rights\" to ensure fair and \ntransparent dairy data governance within an\
    \ ecosystem comprising farmers and industry \ncompanies (Cue et al., 2021, p.\
    \ 6). To support this legislative proposal, Cue et al. (2021) \nconducted a survey\
    \ as part of the Dairy Brain project at the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison\
    \ in 2021. The findings showed that 59% of farmers reported not having signed\
    \ a \ndata sharing agreement in the past five years, while 22% were unsure if\
    \ they had signed \n \n48 \none (unpublished data). Despite this, all farmers\
    \ eventually share their data in some way. \nHence, these concerns are considered\
    \ significant worldwide (Cue et al., 2021, p. 4). \nAccording to Jouanjean et\
    \ al. (2020), farmers are uncertain whether the data collected \nbelongs to them\
    \ or to third parties who provide technological tools. Additionally, Kosior \n\
    (2019a, p. 6) notes that the current network of organizations managing and utilizing\
    \ \nagricultural data operates under an outdated and fragmented regulatory framework.\
    \ The \nabsence of specific legal and regulatory frameworks for smart farming\
    \ data leads to \nmistrust in the farming community and inhibits farmers' willingness\
    \ to share their data. \nPolitical economic factors, such as a lack of a data-sharing\
    \ culture in government and \ninadequate coordination among government entities\
    \ (Cue et al., 2021, p. 11), can further \nhinder the exchange of public sector\
    \ agricultural data. The value of agricultural data that \nhas not been used to\
    \ its full potential is nil. \nIn the World Development Report 2021: Data for\
    \ Better Lives, the World Bank (World \nBank, 2021, p. 190) states that several\
    \ factors have the potential to undermine trust in the \nflow and use of data.\
    \ These include the lack of a legal framework, an inadequate \nimplementation\
    \ of laws, institutions and law enforcement that are weak, or the absence of \n\
    effective ways for parties to enforce their rights (World Bank, 2021, p. 190).\
    \ Additionally, \npractices that provide unfair advantages to certain actors,\
    \ incentives that are skewed or \nunbalanced, and poor or insecure infrastructure\
    \ are also contributing factors. \nIn addition to distrust in agreements with\
    \ ATPs, the OECD (2019a, p. 25) report entitled \n“Digital Opportunities for Better\
    \ Agricultural Policies” notes that farmers frequently lack \nthe necessary tools\
    \ and skills to effectively utilize data for decision-making. This includes \n\
    \ \n49 \ntools for data management and governance, which enable data sharing,\
    \ integration, and \nlinkage across various intelligent systems (OECD, 2019a,\
    \ p. 25). Intelligent systems rely \non big data analytics, cloud computing, machine-to-machine\
    \ communication, and the \nInternet of Things (IoT) (OECD, 2019b, p. 27) to generate\
    \ new and valuable information. \nWithout context, trends, or causal references,\
    \ individual data points are meaningless. The \nOECD report argues that combining\
    \ different types and sources of data can provide \nactionable insights not only\
    \ for farmers but also for regulators and policymakers, \nsignificantly increasing\
    \ the value of the data (OECD, 2019a, p. 26). \nGlobally, several organizations\
    \ are working towards advocating policy solutions for \nenhancing equitable agricultural\
    \ data practices. Some of these key organizations include \nthe Organization for\
    \ Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, \nGlobal Open Data\
    \ for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN), Global Forum on Agricultural \nResearch\
    \ and Innovation (GFAR), and the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience \nInternational\
    \ (CABI), among others. While these organizations emphasize different but \ninterconnected\
    \ facets of agricultural data governance, they promote varied and disjointed \n\
    solutions to the issue. \nWhile digital technologies like drones have shown promise\
    \ in providing efficient \nsolutions for farmers, the potential of the data they\
    \ generate is often underutilized. In an \narticle by Smith Thomas (2022), John\
    \ Church, an associate professor at Thompson Rivers \nUniversity in British Columbia\
    \ and the Regional Innovation Chair in cattle industry \nsustainability, describes\
    \ how drones are useful in monitoring cattle, from checking calving \npastures\
    \ to determining if an animal is sick or has an elevated body temperature. Despite\
    \ \nthese specific uses, it is unclear how the data generated by drones can be\
    \ effectively \n \n50 \ngoverned and utilized to contribute to the sustainability\
    \ of the agricultural sector and its \nsubsectors. \nCABI's Director of Data Policy\
    \ and Practice highlights the importance of addressing the \ninstitutional context\
    \ and the roles of various actors involved in agricultural data \ngovernance,\
    \ including farmers, industry and government statistical organizations, \ntechnology\
    \ businesses, and research institutions. According to the Director, achieving\
    \ real \nchange in agricultural data practices requires an improved data culture\
    \ where trust in data \nis earned and built over time, and where sustainable data\
    \ access is integrated into platforms \nfrom the outset. The Director emphasizes\
    \ the need to address data sharing and mitigate \nrisks during the development\
    \ of interventions, rather than treating them as an afterthought. \nThis approach\
    \ presents an opportunity to promote responsible data practices and to enhance\
    \ \nthe sustainability of the agricultural sector and subsectors. (GFAR Blog,\
    \ 2022, p.3) \nProblem Structuring Methods \nIn the realm of public policy, problem\
    \ structuring is an approach that aims to integrate \nmultiple alternative perspectives\
    \ or views regarding a particular problem situation \n(Rosenhead, 1996). From\
    \ a social stage perspective, structuring a policy problem requires \ntwo distinct\
    \ actions. The first is identifying the problem situation, while the second is\
    \ \nidentifying multiple representations or interpretations of the situation (Hoppe,\
    \ 2018, p. 14) \nfrom the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders. These\
    \ representations must highlight \nthe elements and factors that are contributing\
    \ to the policy problem.  \nThese methods help to identify the characteristics\
    \ of the problem, its type, and the stages \nrequired to structure it. The focus\
    \ is on understanding the problem situation within the \n \n51 \nconditions that\
    \ lead to conflicts or dissatisfaction. According to Dunn (2018, p.69), the \n\
    nature of a policy problem should be defined in terms of needs, values, or opportunities\
    \ for \nimproving or optimizing outcomes. For example, the need to govern agricultural\
    \ data, the \nvalues that underpin the agricultural sector, and the opportunities\
    \ that can be seized to do \nso must be clearly defined as a first step before\
    \ proposing any public policy alternatives. \nIn the case of agricultural data\
    \ governance, farmers are concerned about their contracts \nwith ATPs, lack of\
    \ trust and transparency in accessing, sharing, and using agricultural data, \n\
    as well as doubts about the benefits of using this data (Casalini & Gray, 2020).\
    \ \nAdditionally, the external conditions that contribute to the problem, such\
    \ as power \nasymmetries and data politics among agri-businesses, ATPs, and farmers,\
    \ need to be \ndefined, classified, and evaluated (Dunn, 2018, p.72). Understanding\
    \ the context is \nessential to comprehend the dynamics involved in current agricultural\
    \ data practices. \nWhen approaching the problem of structuring agricultural data\
    \ governance, it is \nessential to assess how stakeholders define the problem.\
    \ The goal is to accurately define \nthe problem in order to identify the appropriate\
    \ solution and avoid what Dunn (2018, p. \n80) refers to as the error of the third\
    \ type21. To this end, there are several methods that can \nbe employed, including\
    \ the problem structuring methods summarized in Table 9. \nTable 9 Characteristics\

    \ \nstakeholders: \nscholars, farmers, \nfarmer-led \nassociations, public, \n\
    and non-profit \nsector organizations \nAdapted from Dunn, 2018 \nThese three\
    \ problem-structuring methods aim to identify the essential elements that \nconstitute\
    \ a problem, including the conditions that lead to stakeholder concerns, mistrust,\
    \ \ndissatisfactions, conflicts, or tensions, as well as external factors. The\
    \ selected problem \nstructuring methods aim to capture diverse perspectives on\
    \ the problem situation to \nfacilitate consensus building on the problem definition.\
    \ Taken together, these methods \noffer a rigorous and comprehensive approach\
    \ to structuring the policy problem of \nagricultural data governance, providing\
    \ valuable insights that enhance the credibility, \ntransferability, and reliability\
    \ of this qualitative research. \nIn order to avoid the error of formulating and\
    \ solving the wrong policy problem (Dunn, \n2018, p.80), this research has selected\
    \ a total of 57 documents for analysis. These \n \n53 \ndocuments include a range\
    \ of sources such as scholarly papers, policy papers, discussion \npapers, industry\
    \ newspapers, research reports from international organizations, and \nwebinars’\
    \ content, all of which are focused on agricultural data practices. By using multiple\
    \ \ntext-data points22, the research benefits from a large number of sources,\
    \ which reduces the \nreliability problem that may arise from a heavy dependence\
    \ on a smaller set of sources. \nMoreover, the larger sample size of 57 text-data\
    \ sources used in this research reduces the \nlikelihood of random error. As a\
    \ result, the possibility of Type III error, which refers to \ndefining the wrong\
    \ problem, is significantly minimized. \nAdditionally, the probability of Type\
    \ II error, which results from structuring the problem \ntoo narrowly, is also\
    \ reduced because the high number of sampled text-data sources tends \nto bring\
    \ forth a greater number of problem elements during analysis. However, the \n\
    possibility of defining the problem too broadly, Type I error, is increased by\
    \ these problem \nstructuring methods. This outcome is due to the only stopping\
    \ rule being the accumulation \nof new problem elements. As such, it is important\
    \ to reassess the scope of the structured \nproblem at the policy formulation\
    \ stage to identify whether any elements are marginal or \nunnecessary. Such elements\
    \ may not contribute to the target problem that solutions seek to \nresolve. \
    \ \n \n22 \"Text-data points\" refer to individual pieces of text-based information\
    \ that are used in research or \nanalysis. By incorporating multiple text-data\
    \ points from a variety of sources, this research is better able to \naccount\
    \ for a range of perspectives and reduce the risk of bias or inaccuracies. \n\
    \ \n54 \n▪ \nContent Analysis \nContent analysis is a widely used method in qualitative\
    \ research for studying various \nphenomena. Its main objective is to uncover\
    \ the implicit meaning of textual data by \nquantifying the significance of written\
    \ language. It examines data present in messages and \ncommunication as opposed\
    \ to observable events or individual characteristics. In this study, \ncontent\
    \ analysis is defined as a “method for investigating social reality, which involves\
    \ \ndeducing the attributes of a non-apparent context [or phenomenon] from the\
    \ characteristics \nof an apparent text” (Krippendorff, 2004, p. 25). \nKrippendorff's\
    \ (2004) definition of content analysis emphasizes the importance of \ncontext\
    \ in analyzing text. By using content analysis to uncover the underlying meaning\
    \ of \ntext, this research can gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex\
    \ policy problem \nof agricultural data governance in the U.S. context. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach allows for \nthe identification of the key elements of the problem,\
    \ which can inform the subsequent use \nof network-based maps and boundary analysis\
    \ to structure the problem and identify \npotential solutions. \nThe process consists\
    \ of several steps to ensure the scientific rigor of the content analysis \nmethod\
    \ in this research. The first step involves defining the research question and\
    \ the scope \nof the analysis. This is followed by selecting the documents that\
    \ will be analyzed from \nvarious sources, including academic literature, policy\
    \ papers, reports, newsletters and \nnewspaper, and webinars’ content. The next\
    \ step involves pre-processing the data to ensure \nthat it was suitable for analysis.\
    \ \n \n55 \nPre-processing the data for this qualitative content analysis involves\
    \ data cleaning23, \ncoding, and categorization based on relevant themes, concepts,\
    \ or categories, which are \ndesigned to organize and analyze the text-data effectively.\
    \ In this research, the qualitative \ncontent analysis involves manual coding,\
    \ which is a widely used method for analyzing \ntextual data. Manual coding entails\
    \ identifying and labeling relevant text segments using \npredetermined categories\
    \ to identify patterns and themes within the selected qualitative \ndata. This\
    \ process helps to uncover key insights and themes and provides a more in-depth\
    \ \nunderstanding of stakeholders’ perspectives. \nFinally, the next step in the\
    \ process involves analyzing the coded data to generate \ninsights and develop\
    \ a problem structure that accurately captured the underlying issues and \nchallenges\
    \ related to agricultural data governance. This process ensures the validity,\
    \ \nreliability, and replicability of the content analysis method and provides\
    \ a clear and \ntransparent framework for conducting the analysis. \nFindings\
    \ from Content Analysis \nThe content analysis conducted in this research was\
    \ delimited to 57 text documents \npublished between October 2020 and May 2022.\
    \ The selection of this time frame was based \non pertinent events related to\
    \ text publications. Specifically, the report titled “Issues around \ndata governance\
    \ in the digital transformation of agriculture: The farmers’ perspective” by \n\
    Jouanjean et al. (2020) published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\
    \ and \nDevelopment, and the report by Ristino and Hart (2022) titled “Modernizing\
    \ Agriculture \n \n23 Data cleaning involves removing irrelevant or extraneous\
    \ information and ensuring that the data is \nconsistent and accurate. This may\
    \ involve checking for inconsistencies, correcting errors, and removing \nduplicates\
    \ \n \n56 \nData Infrastructure to Improve Economic and Ecological Outcomes” published\
    \ by the Data \nFoundation. The literature search query was crafted as follows:\
    \ “agricultural data” or “farm \ndata” or “agricultural data and data governance”\
    \ or “digital technology and agricultural \ndata” or “agricultural data and regulations\
    \ or legal.” Nonetheless, a few documents dated \nfrom 2017, 2018, and 2019 were\
    \ included in the analysis due to their relevance to the \nresearch theme and\
    \ the scarcity of documents addressing the governance of agricultural \ndata.\
    \ The search was conducted based on the criterion that each document addresses\
    \ the \nuse of digital technologies and agricultural data. \nAn initial inventory\
    \ of themes was developed through an inductive thematic analysis of \nthe text\
    \ data set, with the aim of openly codifying text data into interrelated information\
    \ \ncategories (Creswell, 2007). To group codes into a category set, Dey (1993:\
    \ 100) suggests \ninterpreting the data to analyze it. This step requires a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the \ntext to isolate features that may lead to the identification\
    \ of policy problems related to \nagricultural data. \nMoreover, creating categories\
    \ involves grouping related data. The process of grouping \ndata or establishing\
    \ relationships creates categories that are conceptually and empirically \ngrounded.\
    \ That is, categories must be grounded in “relevant empirical [text] material\
    \ and \nrelate to an appropriate analytic context” (Dey, 1993: 102). Table 10\

    \ \nVOS-Viewer Software Analysis  \nThe second method used in this study was the\
    \ VOSviewer software24, which was used \nas a tool to create and visualize maps\
    \ based on network25 data (van Eck & Waltman, 2021, \np. 3). This software utilizes\
    \ text data from reference manager files to create the maps (van \nEck & Waltman,\
    \ 2021, pp. 26–27). The input data for VOSviewer was imported from the \nreference\
    \ repository created in Zotero. The \"network visualization\" option was selected\
    \ \nfrom among the visualization options provided by the software to visualize\
    \ the problem of \nagricultural data. \nTo refine the settings and create the\
    \ map, this research used the objects of interest or \nitems26 (van Eck & Waltman,\
    \ 2021, p. 5) that were identified from the key themes and \nkeywords in the text\
    \ data set. The map includes only the items and links between them, \nrepresenting\
    \ the connections or relations between two or more items. For example, co-\noccurrence\
    \ links were used to represent the number of publications in which certain terms\
    \ \noccur together, based on the keywords identified in each text selected as\
    \ a data source. \nThe software's useful contribution to the policy problem structuring\
    \ process is its ability \nto group each item or keyword into clusters, based\
    \ on their characteristics such as weight \n \n24 VOSviewer “can be used to construct\
    \ networks of scientific publications, scientific journals, \nresearchers, research\
    \ organizations, countries, keywords, or terms. Items in these networks can be\
    \ \nconnected by co-authorship, co-occurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling,\
    \ or co-citation links.” (van Eck \nand Waltman, 2021, p. 3) \n25 A “network is\
    \ a set of items together with the links between the items.” (van Eck and Waltman,\
    \ 2021, \np. 5) \n26 Other types of items to create maps in VOSviewer could be\
    \ for example publications, researchers, or \nterms (tags or key terms). \n \n\
    60 \nand score attributes27. In this case, the weight attributes are the links\
    \ and total link strength \nbetween items based on their co-occurrence28. The\
    \ software then labels the clusters using \ncluster numbers and different colors\
    \ to represent their connections. Figure 11 shows the \ngraphic created by VOSviewer,\
    \ which visualizes the networks constructed based on the \ninput data extracted\
    \ from the text sources reviewed. This serves as a complementary tool \nto the\
    \ categories reflected in the content analysis. \nRelevant factors related to\
    \ agricultural data governance were clearly revealed by \nvisualizing and exploring\
    \ the map created by VOSviewer. As a tool for addressing policy \nproblems, VOSviewer\
    \ effectively identified key themes and keywords related to \nagricultural data\
    \ governance. Through the analysis of the literature sources examined, the \n\
    software discovered a total of 35 co-occurring items or keywords. \n \n27 Both\
    \ attributes are represented by numerical values. For example, “A weight of an\
    \ item should in some \nway indicate the importance of the item. An item with\
    \ a higher weight is regarded as more important than \nan item with a lower weight…\
    \ A score attribute may indicate any numerical property of items.” (van Eck \n\
    and Waltman, 2021, p. 6) \n28 For any item this is “the number of links of an\
    \ item with other items and the total strength of the links \nof an item with\
    \ other items.” (van Eck and Waltman, 2021, p. 6) \n \n61 \nFigure 11 Keywords\
    \ co-occurrence network-based map of agricultural data problem \n \nFigure 11\
    \ displays a co-occurrence network based on high-frequency agricultural data \n\
    keywords found in the selected text data sources. VOSviewer's default colors were\
    \ used to \nindicate the five clusters of agricultural keywords, with lines showing\
    \ the distance between \nthe keywords. The red color represents the smart farming\
    \ cluster, with main connection \nlines to trust and data ownership. The blue\
    \ lines connect the transparency cluster, yellow \nlines present the code of conduct\
    \ cluster, green lines represent the data sharing cluster, and \npurple lines\
    \ depict the agricultural policy cluster. The distance between the keywords on\
    \ \nthe network indicates the level of co-occurrence and their relationship. The\
    \ closer the \ndistance, the higher the co-occurrence and stronger the relationship\
    \ between the keywords. \n \n62 \nIn addition to complementing the content analysis,\
    \ this map provides further insight into \nthe key policy problem factors related\
    \ to agricultural data governance. By clustering related \nkeywords according\
    \ to their co-occurrence and highlighting their connections, the map \nilluminates\
    \ the interrelationships between various themes and sheds light on their relevance\
    \ \nto the overarching policy problem. Thus, the map enhances our understanding\
    \ of the \ncomplex and multifaceted issues involved in governing agricultural\
    \ data. \nOne limitation of using VOSviewer is that it relies solely on text data\
    \ from reference \nmanager files, which may not capture all relevant sources on\
    \ a particular topic. To address \nthis, future studies could consider using multiple\
    \ sources of data, such as social media, \ngovernment reports, or interviews with\
    \ stakeholders, to provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of the policy\
    \ problem.  \n▪ \nBoundary Analysis \nBoundary analysis is a method used to define\
    \ the key elements of a policy problem by \nincorporating input from stakeholders\
    \ who have explicit knowledge or experience with the \ntopic (Dunn, 2018). The\
    \ aim of the boundary analysis method in this study is to specify \nand conclude\
    \ the structuring of the policy problem for governing agricultural data based\
    \ \non the key themes identified in the previous content analysis and software\
    \ analysis. The \npurpose of this approach is to estimate \"whether the system\
    \ of individual problem \nformulations … is relatively complete\" (Dunn, 2018,\
    \ p. 89). In other words, the goal is to \nidentify multiple problems that are\
    \ defined in different ways by key stakeholders in the \nagriculture sector. Overall,\
    \ this analysis seeks to establish the boundaries necessary to \nformulate the\
    \ policy problem of governing agricultural data in a comprehensive manner. \n\
    \ \n63 \nDunn's (2018) three-step process for boundary analysis includes saturation\
    \ sampling, \nelicitation of problem representation, and boundary estimation.\
    \ The first step, saturation \nsampling, involves an exhaustive review of biographic\
    \ references in selected documents to \nidentify additional actors or stakeholders\
    \ who discuss agricultural data issues. This process \ncontinues until no new\
    \ references are found, ensuring that a comprehensive list of \nstakeholders is\
    \ identified. The next step, elicitation of problem representation, involves a\
    \ \nsystematic analysis of stakeholder descriptions of the problem. This analysis\
    \ may include \ninterviews, surveys, or other means of gathering information from\
    \ stakeholders. The final \nstep, boundary estimation, involves identifying the\
    \ key elements or boundaries of the \nproblem by analyzing the stakeholder descriptions\
    \ and identifying areas of agreement or \ndisagreement. By following this three-step\
    \ process, boundary analysis can provide a \ncomprehensive and structured approach\
    \ to understanding the policy problem of governing \nagricultural data. \nThe\
    \ content analysis method was used to obtain \"problem representations from \n\
    stakeholders\" (Dunn, 2018, p. 91). Each text data set was revisited to select\
    \ text units that \nexplained how each actor or stakeholder described the issues\
    \ of data governance for farm \ndata. The context for the content under analysis\
    \ was provided by scholars, farm \nassociations, news sites in agriculture, and\
    \ publications from international organizations. \nFinally, the boundary estimation\
    \ process involved summing the cumulative frequency of \nkey agricultural data\
    \ problems from all text-data sources. A brief explanation of the three-\nstep\
    \ process is shown in Figure 12 and boundary estimations is displayed in a pareto\
    \ chart \nin Figure 13. \n \n64 \nFigure 12 Explanation of the boundary analysis\
    \ three-step process \n \nAdapted from Dunn 2018 \nThe first step involved accessing\
    \ written descriptions of the problem by stakeholders in \nthe agricultural sector\
    \ using text data sets collection. From the available documents, the \nsecond\
    \ step involved identifying problem representations within the bounded system\
    \ of \nstakeholders. These are \"ideas, basic paradigms, dominant metaphors, standard\
    \ operating \nprocedures, ... by which [stakeholders] attach meaning to events\"\
    \ (Dunn, 2018, p. 91). The \nthird step, represented by the Pareto chart in Figure\
    \ 12, shows the estimated boundary of \nthe key agricultural data problems that\
    \ were identified through content analysis. The Pareto \nchart primarily organizes\
    \ the count of themes, subthemes, and keywords obtained from the \ncontent analysis.\
    \ The revision of these themes was also compared with the keywords \nvisualized\
    \ in the VOSviewer map. \n• Thorough \nexamination of \nbiographic      \nreferences\

    \ above provided the basis for defining a set of problem \ndimensions. The key\
    \ agricultural data items were classified into four dimensions: data \nsharing,\
    \ data production cycle, data rights and norms, and smart farming. Figure 14 \n\
    provides an overview of the most important dimensions of the policy problem, based\
    \ on \nthe results of the content analysis, VOSviewer software, and boundary analysis.\

    \ relevant dimensions in the agricultural data governance \npolicy problem \n\
    \ \nThe identified dimensions of the agricultural data governance problem emphasize\
    \ the \nimportance of a data governance policy framework that establishes guidelines,\
    \ standards, \nand roles to facilitate data sharing across the agriculture sectors\
    \ in the United States. This \nframework should focus on developing trustworthy\
    \ data-sharing systems and environments \nthrough mechanisms and measures that\
    \ enable agricultural data access and use. To achieve \nthis, the agricultural\
    \ data governance framework should prioritize trust and transparency \nin data\
    \ sharing, enhance mechanisms to increase data availability, and overcome technical\
    \ \nbarriers to data reuse within the sector. Such measures will enhance the value\
    \ and benefits \nthat the agriculture sector can derive from agricultural data,\
    \ transforming it into a smart \nand digitally transformed industry. \nThe use\
    \ of the three methods aimed to identify and map different perspectives on \n\
    agricultural data governance, and structure it as a policy problem through a multi-\n\

    \ However, it is important to note that these methods have a moderate \nlevel\
    \ of replicability, as they rely on general guidelines and specific descriptions\
    \ that may \nbe subject to researcher subjectivity and research context. \nThe\
    \ policy problem of agricultural data governance, as currently structured and\
    \ \nassuming its proper structuring, appears to be a broad but relatively well-organized\
    \ and \nmoderately complex policy problem. To further evaluate the agricultural\
    \ data policy \nproblem, ten wicked problem characteristics developed by Rittel\
    \ and Weber (1973) were \nused to demonstrate the moderately structured nature\
    \ of this problem. These characteristics \nare presented in Table 11. \nTable\

    \ \nSecondary/Functional \nAdapted from Rittel and Weber 1973 \n \n68 \nAccording\
    \ to Mitroff (1974, p. 224 in Dunn, 2018), well-structured problems are those\
    \ \nfor which enough information is available to understand their sources and\
    \ develop feasible \npolicy solutions. While the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem is complex, it is \nmoderately well-defined, with evidence available\
    \ to help settle differences between \nstakeholders. Unlike a value-based problem,\
    \ this policy problem is not solely based on \nconflicting values or preferences,\
    \ but rather on practical challenges related to data sharing \nand management.\
    \ The policy solutions developed in the agriculture sector could be applied \n\
    to other sectors facing similar challenges. \nThe policy problem of agricultural\
    \ data governance is a complex and evolving issue, \nwith multiple stakeholders\
    \ involved in the governance of agricultural data, including \nfarmers, agricultural\
    \ technology providers, tech companies, and agribusiness. As data \nbecomes increasingly\
    \ central to agricultural production, there is a growing need to establish \n\
    guidelines, standards, and roles to facilitate data sharing and use across the\
    \ sector.  \nAdditionally, as the volume of agricultural data continues to increase,\
    \ there is a need for \nmechanisms to ensure data privacy and security, as well\
    \ as to address cybersecurity risks. \nFurthermore, there is a need to overcome\
    \ technical barriers to data reuse and establish \ntrustworthy data-sharing environments\
    \ to increase trust and transparency in the sector. \nOverall, a governance framework\
    \ for agricultural data is essential to maximize the sector's \nbenefits and value,\
    \ transforming it into a smart and digitally transformed industry. \n \n69 \n\
    Chapter 3: Policy Options \nThis chapter employs a comparative case analysis approach\
    \ to propose three distinct \npolicy options for agricultural data governance,\
    \ aimed at addressing the policy problem \nidentified in Chapter 2. The methods\
    \ used for the comparative case analysis include bench-\nmarking and lesson-drawing.\
    \ \nThe policy options, labeled as minimal, moderate, and maximal, are designed\
    \ to offer \ndistinctive solutions to the policy problem. To develop these options,\
    \ this research maps \nthe existing policy frameworks in other jurisdictions and\
    \ explore the potential \ntransferability of legal provisions to the agricultural\
    \ data governance context in the U.S. \nThis approach aims to fill the legal void\
    \ that currently exists in the U.S. agriculture sector \nregarding the governance\
    \ of agricultural data.  \nGeneric Standards \nMost legal regulations and policy\
    \ provisions that govern data are structured around two \nmain components: safeguards\
    \ and enablers. These components include standards for \nprotecting personal and\
    \ non-personal data, as well as ensuring secure mechanisms and \nprocesses for\
    \ the flow of private and public intent data sharing. Examples of these \nregulations\
    \ and policies include the \"Gramm-Leach Bliley\" Act (GLBA) for the financial\
    \ \nservice industry, the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability\
    \ Act (HIPAA) for \nthe healthcare industry, and the California Consumer Privacy\
    \ Act (CCPA). However, in \nthe United States, agricultural data is currently\
    \ governed by contracts and licensing \nagreements controlled by private agricultural\
    \ corporations. This practice creates an \n \n70 \nenvironment where farmers and\
    \ primary producers have limited bargaining power and little \nincentive to share\
    \ their data.  \nThe Global Data Regulation Diagnostic publication from the World\
    \ Bank (Chen, 2021) \npresents a detailed assessment of laws and regulations on\
    \ data governance. Its content \ncovers both safeguards and enablers for data\
    \ governance across 80 countries ranging from \nlow to high-income groups (Chen,\
    \ 2021, p. 1). Figure 15 provides a useful overview of the \ndifferent components\
    \ of a data governance framework29 that can be used to guide the \nanalysis of\
    \ policy options for agricultural data governance in the U.S. \n \n29 A framework\
    \ understood as a structured and well-defined description of the data activities\
    \ upon which \na policy should be built. A policy framework in this research establishes\
    \ a set of criteria for selecting \nfeatures, elements, components, or mechanisms\
    \ from each existing data governance regulation that could \nsolve the agricultural\
    \ data problem in the United States. \n \n71 \nFigure 15 Data Governance Policy\
    \ Framework Components considered for Agricultural \nData \n \nAdapted from Chen,\
    \ 2021 \nSafeguards refer to norms or legal regulations that aim to protect the\
    \ data-related rights \nof market players, while enablers are norms or laws that\
    \ aim to facilitate the use and re-use \nof data (Chen, 2021). Both pillars, safeguards\
    \ and enablers, contain components that foster \ntrust and transparency among\
    \ stakeholders in governing data.  \nBy drawing on the best practices and lessons\
    \ learned from other jurisdictions, this \nresearch aims to develop a set of policy\
    \ options for agricultural data governance in the \nUnited States. These policy\
    \ options will be based on a comparative case analysis of existing \n \n72 \n\
    data governance frameworks30, with a particular focus on the regulatory components\
    \ of the \nCodes of Practice, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance\
    \ and \nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the California Consumer Privacy\
    \ Act \n(CCPA), and the EU Data Governance Act. The selection of these laws and\
    \ regulations \nwas based on their relevance to the data governance dimensions,\
    \ which include both \nsafeguards and enablers, and their potential to address\
    \ some of the challenges in the \nagricultural sector.  \nThe Codes of Practice\
    \ provide principles and guidelines to promote responsible data \npractices. The\
    \ GLBA and HIPAA have frameworks for safeguarding personal data, which \nare important\
    \ considerations in the agricultural sector where personal data such as financial\
    \ \ninformation, bank loans and credit scores, and land ownership information\
    \ may be \ncollected from farmers. The CCPA has provisions for regulating the\
    \ use of non-personal \ndata, which are relevant for the agricultural sector where\
    \ both types of data (personal and \nnon-personal31) are generated and shared.\
    \ \nOne of the key challenges in agricultural data governance is balancing the\
    \ need for \nprivacy and data protection with the benefits of data sharing and\
    \ collaboration. On the one \nhand, farmers and other primary producers need to\
    \ be able to trust that their data will be \nkept confidential and used only for\
    \ agreed-upon purposes. On the other hand, data sharing \ncan lead to important\
    \ insights and innovations that can benefit the entire agricultural sector. \n\
    \ \n30 These frameworks include a mix of safeguards and enablers, such as data\
    \ protection regulations, data \nsharing agreements, and technical standards for\
    \ data interoperability. However, there is no one-size-fits-all \nsolution to\
    \ data governance, and policymakers must carefully consider the unique context\
    \ of their own \njurisdiction when developing data governance policies. \n31 Non-personal\
    \ data in the agriculture sector are agronomic data, such as soil type, crop type,\
    \ planting \ndensity, fertilization, and pesticide usage. \n \n73 \nFinding a\
    \ good balance between these competing interests is a difficult but necessary\
    \ task \nfor this study. \nCodes of Practice \nThis section analyzes four Codes\
    \ of Practice (COPs), also known as Codes of Conduct. \nCOPs are industry-led\
    \ self-regulatory frameworks for agricultural data practices. These \nCOPs aim\
    \ to promote good agricultural data practices among farmers, producers, and \n\
    agribusiness companies or ATPs. They comprise voluntary sets of rules based on\
    \ principles \n(Sanderson et al., 2018) and are intended to shape the behavior\
    \ of business or community \norganizations, and are enforced by the industry or\
    \ sector itself (Sanderson, 2019, p.6). \nThese codes address issues such as data\
    \ ownership providing definitions and best practices \nfor the management of agricultural\
    \ data. While adherence to these COPs is voluntary, they \noffer a framework for\
    \ stakeholders in the agriculture sector to work together and promote \nresponsible,\
    \ responsive, and transparent data contracting practices. \nCurrently, there are\
    \ only four codes available: the U.S. Farm Bureau Privacy and \nSecurity Principles\
    \ for Farm Data, the EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing \nby Contractual\
    \ Agreement, the New Zealand Farm Data Code of Practice, and the \nAustralian\
    \ Farm Data Code. These codes are relatively new, with the U.S. and New \nZealand\
    \ pioneering the launch of their codes of agricultural data practices in 2014,\
    \ \nsupported by private agriculture industry associations and businesses, and\
    \ in some cases, \nwith governmental assistance. \n \n74 \nWhile COPs represent\
    \ an initial collaborative effort to promote awareness about the \nvalue of agricultural\
    \ data among farmers, producers, and ATPs, they are relatively new32, \nnon-binding,\
    \ and their impact, effects, and consequences in terms of effectively governing\
    \ \nagricultural data between farmers and ATPs, as well as agribusiness companies,\
    \ remain \nunknown. According to Sanderson et al. (2018, p. 15), given the voluntary\
    \ nature of the \nfour existing COPs, there are additional challenges at the macro\
    \ structural-institutional \nlevel. These include the appropriation of an agile\
    \ agricultural data normative framework33, \nthe extension and implementation\
    \ of COPs, issues around trademark-based logos created \nfrom these codes, and\
    \ the assessment of the effects or consequences of existing COPs.  \nThe question\
    \ of whether self-policing by farm associations and agribusiness groups is \n\
    sufficient or whether additional oversight is necessary is complex. On the one\
    \ hand, \nallowing industry stakeholders to regulate themselves can be more efficient\
    \ and responsive \nto sector-specific issues, but on the other hand, it can also\
    \ lead to conflicts of interest and \na lack of accountability. \nIn this scenario,\
    \ the COPs are not mandatory and lack legal enforceability, thus the \nparties\
    \ engaged in data contracts have complete discretion over their adherence. Therefore,\
    \ \nthere is a possibility that certain parties may not adhere to the principles\
    \ outlined in the \ncodes, or that various stakeholders may interpret and implement\
    \ them inconsistently. \nThese four COPs have three general goals. First, to raise\
    \ awareness among farmers and \nproducers about the importance of agricultural\
    \ data. Second, to empower them to use data \n \n32 Most of them have been in\
    \ force since 2014. \n33 Sanders et al (2018) understand as an agile ag-data normative\
    \ framework as the set of rules, norms or \nprinciples regulating or norming the\
    \ agricultural data practices. \n \n75 \nto build a profitable future. And third,\
    \ to encourage agribusiness companies and ATPs to \nadopt more responsible, responsive,\
    \ and transparent data contracting practices. These \ncodes serve as the foundation\
    \ for resolving sector concerns related to agricultural data \ngovernance, including\
    \ issues around data ownership. \nThese COPs propose a collective action approach\
    \ to empower farmers and primary \nproducers to pursue transparent transactions\
    \ or practices of agricultural data through \ncontractual agreements. They are\
    \ based on definition of core principles and best practices \nfor agricultural\
    \ data, involving all stakeholders willing to comply, from farmers and \nproducers\
    \ to agribusiness and technology providers. According to Sanderson et al. (2018,\
    \ \np. 2), the purpose of agricultural codes of practice is \"inextricably linked\
    \ to consent, \ndisclosure, transparency, and ultimately, the building of trust.\"\
    \  \nOther contributions from all of these COPs include the specification of terms\
    \ and \ndefinitions. For example, the EU-COD defines what a data originator34\
    \ is, what their rights \nare, and data pseudonymization35. In the case of the\
    \ Australian Agricultural Data Rules, it \ncovers the concepts of data governance,\
    \ management, and implementation. It includes a \ncapacity and capability-building\
    \ component to educate farmers, as well as a risk, \nregulation, and compliance\
    \ component to ensure cybersecurity. \nAll of the principles embodied in these\
    \ codes for agricultural data practices are the result \nof collective action\
    \ by stakeholders in the agriculture sector. Efforts to develop and publish \n\
    \ \n34 Data originator is defined as the “person or entity that can claim the\
    \ exclusive right to license access to \nthe data and control its downstream to\
    \ use or re-use” (EU-CoD, 2018) \n35 Data pseudonymization is the “procedure in\
    \ which the most revealing fields within a data record are \nreplaced by one or\
    \ more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms.” (EU-CoD, 2018). Its main purpose\
    \ is to \n“render the data record less identifiable and therefore lower the risks\
    \ involved in its use” \n \n76 \ncodes of practice are based on consensus and\
    \ agreements among interested farm \nassociations, agribusiness companies, and\
    \ other agricultural industry organizations. The \nrole of the government in promoting\
    \ credibility and legitimacy in the principles promoted \nby COPs, as well as\
    \ monitoring compliance with them, is important. Governments can \nserve as a\
    \ third-party enforcer of compliance with the principles and act as a mediator\
    \ in \ncases of disputes. \n▪ \nNew Zealand Farm Data Code of Practice \nThe Farm\
    \ Data Code of Practice Version 1.1 was launched in New Zealand in 201436 \nafter\
    \ extensive consultation and planning across the agriculture sector. This code\
    \ provides \nguidelines for effective data sharing in the country's agriculture\
    \ industry and is adhered to \nby organizations such as Dairy NZ, the Red Meat\
    \ Profit Partnership, and the Ministry of \nPrimary Industries to ensure that\
    \ farmers' information is handled appropriately. The code \noffers recommended\
    \ standards and requirements for collecting, storing, and sharing \nagricultural\
    \ data and is owned and operated by Farm Data Accreditation Ltd (FDAL), an \n\
    independent company whose shareholders include the industry representative \n\
    organizations that created and mandated the code. \nThe Farm Data Code of Practice\
    \ in New Zealand regulates organizations that collect, \nstore, and share primary\
    \ agriculture data, with a focus on implementing practices that \nprovide primary\
    \ producers37  with confidence regarding their data security. Registered \n \n\
    36 According to the New Zealand Code of Practice, in “April 2015, ownership of\
    \ the Farm Data Code of \nPractice was transferred to an independent company,\
    \ Farm Data Accreditation Limited.” More information \navailable at:   \n37 “Primary\
    \ producers” is the term used to refer to farmers in the New Zealand COP. \n \n\
    77 \norganizations have agreed to disclose their practices and policies related\
    \ to data rights, \nprocessing, sharing, storage, and security (FDAL, 2016) to\
    \ increase data sharing securely \nwithin the sector and promote innovation in\
    \ services and products.  \nFDAL, an independent company, oversees the Code and\
    \ provides administrative and \noperation services to agriculture companies with\
    \ an annual license, certificate, and \npermission to use the trademark. FDAL\

    \ \n▪ \nEuropean Union Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing \nby Contractual\
    \ Agreement \nIn the European Union38, a coalition of European farm associations39\
    \ from the EU agri-\nfood chain launched the Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data\
    \ Sharing by Contractual \nAgreement in 2018. Prior to these Code, agricultural\
    \ data was collected, stored, and used \n \n38 See Kosior, K. 2019 “From Analogue\

    \ (CEJA), European Crop Protection Association (ECPA), European \nForum of Farm\
    \ Animal Breeders (EFFAB), European Compound Feed Manufactures’ Federation \n\
    (FEFAC), and European Seed Association (ESA).  \n \n \n78 \nby public institutions\
    \ (Kosior, 2019b), but the rapid development and implementation of \nfarming technologies\
    \ that generate large amounts of data highlighted the need for the Code \nof Conduct.\
    \ \nThis COP was developed with the input of various stakeholders from the agri-food\
    \ value \nchain, including farmers, agri-businesses, and public institutions.\
    \ This collaborative \napproach helped ensure that the guidelines are practical,\
    \ effective, and widely accepted. \nInitially, nine agro-associations40 developed\
    \ the guidelines for processing and sharing \nagricultural data in the EU Code.\
    \ The Code of Conduct was created to promote access to \naccurate agricultural\
    \ data, which is a crucial step \"to develop digital farming enabling \nfarmers\
    \ to produce more using fewer resources\" (Koerhuis, 2018, p.1). It provides guidance\
    \ \non the use of agricultural data, particularly on the rights to access and\
    \ use the data. It \nincludes a checklist as well as key guidelines for operators\
    \ to follow. Janzen (2018) and \nKoerhuis (2018) suggest that granting access\
    \ to agricultural data will facilitate and \naccelerate data-driven business models\
    \ in this sector. \nThis COP fosters a dialogue among all stakeholders in the\
    \ agri-food value chain \n(Wiseman et al., 2019, p. 7) to encourage fair and transparent\
    \ contractual agreement rules \nfor data sharing. Unlike the codes in the United\
    \ States and New Zealand, the European \nUnion's Code of Conduct provides specific\
    \ definitions to govern contracts between farmers \nand agri-business, preventing\
    \ contractual agreements from being misinterpreted.  \n \n40 Since 2018, the government\
    \ has partnered with industry associations such as Copa-Cogeca40, European \n\
    Agricultural Machinery (CEMA), Fertilizers Europe, the European Confederation\
    \ of Agricultural, Rural \nand Forestry Contractors (CEETTAR), European Council\
    \ of Young Farmers (CEJA), European Crop \nProtection Association (ECPA), European\
    \ Forum of Farm Animal Breeders (EFFAB), European Feed \nManufacturers' Federation\
    \ (FEFAC), and European Space Agency (ESA). \n \n79 \nThe Code of Conduct establishes\
    \ guidelines focusing on the rights and obligations \nassociated with the use\
    \ and sharing of agricultural data. It uses a \"compliance tool\" \n(Wiseman et\
    \ al. 2019, p.9) which is a contract checklist for agricultural data, to ensure\
    \ a \ntrustworthy environment to construct data-driven business models that benefit\
    \ all \nstakeholders involved in using a product or service that collects or uses\
    \ agricultural data. \nAccording to van der Burg et al. (2021, p. 6), the EU COP's\
    \ key features are its five \nprinciples: data ownership, data access, control\
    \ and portability, data protection and \ntransparency, privacy and security, and\
    \ intellectual property rights. \nOne additional point to consider regarding the\
    \ EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural \nData Sharing is the important role that\
    \ data standardization plays in its implementation. \nStandardization is critical\
    \ for ensuring data compatibility and interoperability between \ndifferent stakeholders\
    \ in the agricultural sector, as well as for improving the quality of the \ndata\
    \ itself. The EU Code of Conduct specifically encourages the use of existing standards\
    \ \nfor data exchange and storage, such as the ISO 1178341 standard for agricultural\
    \ technology \nand the AgGateway ADAPT framework42. This emphasis on standardization\
    \ helps to \n \n41 ISO 11783, also known as the Tractor Implement Management System\

    \ protocol for electronic control units (ECUs) used in agricultural machinery,\
    \ \nallowing them to exchange data and communicate with one another. The standard\
    \ covers a wide range of \nfunctions, including the exchange of data between tractors\

    \ Data Rules: Enabling Best Practices  \nThe Agricultural Data Rules were developed\
    \ in Australia and published in February \n2020 with the support of the National\
    \ Farmers’ Federation and the Australian Government \nDepartment of Agriculture,\
    \ Water and the Environment. This code was developed as part \nof the \"Growing\
    \ a digital future for Australian Agriculture\" program, and originated from \n\
    the ‘Accelerating precision agriculture to decision agriculture: Enabling digital\
    \ agriculture \nin Australia’ (P2D) project which evaluated the desired state\
    \ of digital agriculture in the \ncountry (Wiseman, 2019). \nThe National Farmers'\
    \ Federation partnered with a range of stakeholders, including \nfarmers, industry\
    \ bodies, government agencies, and technology providers. These \npartnerships\
    \ were critical in ensuring that the code was tailored to the needs of Australian\
    \ \nfarmers and industry participants, while also providing a framework for collaboration\
    \ and \ninnovation in the sector. \n \nsoftware applications used in agriculture.\
    \ The ADAPT framework provides a set of standard application \nprogramming interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that can be used to integrate different agricultural software systems,\
    \ such as \nfarm management systems, precision agriculture tools, and machinery\
    \ control systems. The framework is \ndesigned to be flexible and scalable, allowing\
    \ it to adapt to different types of data and workflows used in \nagriculture.\
    \ The ADAPT framework enables users to access data from different sources and\
    \ use it to inform \ndecision-making, improving the efficiency and profitability\
    \ of agricultural operations. Information \navailable at: AGGateway. (2021). AGGateway\

    \ \n \n81 \nThe main objective of the Agricultural Data Rules is to not only develop\
    \ a data rules \nframework, but also to include an action plan that will create\
    \ an enabling environment for \ndigital innovation in Australian agricultural\
    \ industries (Wiseman & Sanderson, 2020, p. 3). \nThis code incorporates definitions\
    \ and principles from both the EU and New Zealand \nCOPs, making it a more robust\
    \ and comprehensive code for addressing the agricultural \ndata problem in Australia.\
    \ \nTo facilitate agricultural innovation through data-driven decision-making\
    \ and a reliable \nflow of agricultural data, the Australian Agricultural Data\
    \ Rules are structured around three \nkey pillars: people, responsibilities, and\
    \ structures. The roles of individuals handling \nagricultural data are essential\
    \ to the success of the code, and the \"capacity and capability\" \nand \"risk,\
    \ regulation, and compliance\" components address this issue. The former covers\
    \ \ncommunication, education, and training, while the latter addresses risk assessment,\
    \ \ncybersecurity, complaints, breach, and reporting (Wiseman & Sanderson, 2020,\
    \ p. 6).  \nThe code outlines six key principles for agricultural data management,\
    \ including \ngovernance, transparency, privacy, security, accessibility, and\
    \ usability. It provides \nguidelines for responsible data sharing, such as obtaining\
    \ consent from data owners, \nensuring data quality and accuracy, and protecting\
    \ sensitive information. By including \nthese principles and guidelines, the code\
    \ provides a comprehensive framework for the \nmanagement and sharing of agricultural\
    \ data in Australia.  \nWhile the code provides a valuable framework for data\
    \ governance and responsible data \nsharing, it may require significant resources\
    \ and investment to implement effectively. \nAdditionally, there may be challenges\
    \ in ensuring compliance with the code's guidelines, \n \n82 \nparticularly for\
    \ small-scale farmers and other stakeholders who may have limited resources \n\
    or technical capabilities. \n▪ \nThe U.S. Privacy and Security Principles for\
    \ Farm Data \nIn 2014, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), commodity groups,\
    \ farm \norganizations, and ATPs jointly formulated the \"Privacy and Security\
    \ Principles for Farm \nData\"43, also known as the Core Principles, which is\
    \ the most extensive code in the U.S. \nTwo years later, in 2016, AFBF, along\
    \ with other organizations and agribusiness \ncompanies, established the Ag-Data\
    \ Transparency Evaluator Inc44, a non-profit \norganization that developed the\
    \ Ag-Data Transparent logo or seal of approval45. This logo \nrecognizes compliance\
    \ with the Core Principles for agricultural data. However, no \nscholarly literature\
    \ or other documents are available that demonstrate or describe the \nverification\
    \ processes for Core Principles compliance. \nThe goal of the U.S. Core Principles\
    \ is to encourage as many agribusiness and \nagricultural tech companies46 as\
    \ possible to commit47 to including them in their contracts \nand agreements with\
    \ farmers. According to the information available on Ag-Data \n \n43 The Core\
    \ Principles are available at: https://www.agdatatransparent.com/principles \n\
    44 It is a non-profit organization providing the certification process based on\
    \ the Core Principles at a cost \ndepending on the size of the organization, whether\
    \ it is a startup, standard or large. More information \navailable at: https://www.agdatatransparent.com/about\
    \ and at: \nhttps://www.agdatatransparent.com/principles. \n45 An official logo\
    \ acting as a certificate of voluntary commitment to comply with the core principles\
    \ of \nagricultural data practices. \n46 According to the AFBF web page information,\
    \ over 37 organizations –agribusiness technology \nproviders (ATP) contracting\
    \ with farmers– have agreed to follow these Core Principles. \n47 Guarantee to\
    \ incorporate the Core Principles into ag-data contracts mainly based on a sign\
    \ of good \nfaith, since the ag data principles are non-binding guidelines. \n\
    \ \n83 \nTransparent, over 37 organizations (Certified Companies Ag Data Transparent,\
    \ 2022) in \nthe United States have agreed to follow the Core Principles and have\
    \ obtained the Ag Data \nTransparent certification as proof of compliance. This\
    \ certification process is based on the \n13 \"core principles,\" (Core Principles\
    \ Ag Data Transparent, 2022)48 and companies or \nATPs must answer 11 questions49\
    \ about how they collect, use, share, and protect farmers' \nagricultural data.\
    \ These answers are reviewed and approved by an independent third-party \nadministrator\
    \ (Certified Companies Ag Data Transparent, 2022), and when approved, \nADT issues\
    \ the certification seal. \nThe ADT seal or logo serves as an assurance to farmers\
    \ that organizations can be trusted \nto handle their agricultural data in contracts.\
    \ According to Todd Janzen, the ADT \nadministrator, the seal \"is helping provide\
    \ transparency, simplicity, and trust for farmers \nand their tech providers.\"\
    \ While the \"core principles\" for agricultural data are essential, the \ncertification\
    \ process demonstrates how they can be put into practice.  \nThe Core Principles\
    \ require agribusinesses to be open and transparent about their data \ncollection\
    \ and usage practices. Companies are expected to disclose the types of data they\
    \ \ncollect, how it is collected, and how it is used. They are also required to\
    \ be transparent \nabout the third parties with whom they share data and the purposes\
    \ for which they share it. \nIn addition to transparency, the U.S. Core Principles\
    \ emphasize the importance of \nsecurity in agricultural data practices. The principles\
    \ recognize that agricultural data is \nsensitive and valuable information that\
    \ requires protection. The Core Principles require \n \n48 Information available\

    \ \n \n84 \nagribusinesses to implement reasonable security measures to protect\
    \ agricultural data from \nunauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The principles\
    \ also require companies to provide \nfarmers with information about their security\
    \ practices, including how they secure data, \nwhat security measures they have\
    \ in place, and how they respond to security incidents. \nOverall, the U.S. Core\
    \ Principles for Farm Data represent an important step towards \nestablishing\
    \ responsible data practices in the agriculture sector. By emphasizing the \n\
    importance of data control, transparency, and security, the Core Principles provide\
    \ a \nframework for agribusinesses and farmers to work together in a more responsible\
    \ and \ntrustworthy manner. The principles are not legally binding, but they provide\
    \ a valuable set \nof guidelines that can help ensure that agricultural data is\
    \ managed in a responsible and \nethical manner. \nIn summary, the common objective\
    \ of these codes is to create trusting environments and \nrelationships for sharing\
    \ and using agricultural data between farmers, producers, and \nservice, machinery,\
    \ and digital tech agribusiness providers based on contract agreements. \nNonetheless,\
    \ adherence to all agricultural data practices codes is entirely voluntary, as\
    \ they \nare non-binding guidelines for parties who agree to work together based\
    \ on data contracts. \nFigure 16 provides a visual comparison of these codes,\
    \ illustrating the gradual contribution \nof each code to the agricultural data\
    \ practices of the four countries. \n \n85 \nFigure 16 Comparison of existing\
    \ COPs \n \nAdapted from GODAN50 (2022) \nFigure 16 shows an incremental comparison\
    \ of the four COPs analyzed in this section. \nEach of these COPs includes comparable\
    \ guidelines and principles to enhance agricultural \ndata practices in their\
    \ respective countries. The Australian COP, released in 2020, \nintegrates numerous\
    \ definitions and principles from the preceding codes, while also \nemphasizing\
    \ the significance of enhancing capacity and capabilities within the agricultural\
    \ \nsector to effectively collect, manage, and utilize agricultural data. This\
    \ includes providing \ntraining and education to farmers and other stakeholders\
    \ on data collection and analysis \n \n50 GODAN toolkit: “Code of Conduct Constructor”\

    \ as well as investing in the necessary infrastructure and technology to enable\
    \ \neffective data sharing and collaboration. \nCOPs are voluntary and principle-based\
    \ guidelines for the self-regulation of agricultural \ndata practices. While they\
    \ are not legally enforceable, they have the potential to drive \nsignificant\
    \ industry-wide shifts in data practices. These COPs provide foundational \ncomponents\
    \ for governing agricultural data, engaging stakeholders, fostering trust and\
    \ \ntransparency, and creating innovative pathways to extract value from agricultural\
    \ data. \nHowever, there is currently no conclusive evidence that these COPs are\
    \ effective tools for \nsupporting agricultural data practices in any of the countries\
    \ where they are in force.  \nCOPs can be a starting point for policy frameworks,\
    \ as they encourage discussions and \ncollaboration to find solutions that meet\
    \ the needs and interests of all involved parties. The \nGlobal Open Data for\
    \ Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN), the Technical Centre for \nAgriculture and\
    \ Rural Cooperation (CTA), and the Global Forum on Agricultural Research \nand\
    \ Innovation (GFAR) have jointly launched a toolkit that enables stakeholders\
    \ to develop \nand simulate their own agricultural codes of conduct.  \nThe Agricultural\
    \ Codes of Conduct Toolkit is the result of a consultative process \ninvolving\
    \ the GODAN/CTA Sub-Group on Data Codes of Conduct, as part of a planned \nglobal\
    \ collective action on Empowering Farmers through Equitable Data Sharing. The\
    \ \ntoolkit aims to enable stakeholders to better understand the needs and concerns\
    \ of all actors \ninvolved in the agricultural data value chain, thus strengthening\
    \ trust across the industry. \nIt features 17 clauses that users can access and\
    \ select from depending on their relevance. \nWhile these clauses are not exhaustive\
    \ and do not replace a robust institutional framework, \n \n87 \nthey can be useful\
    \ in guiding decision-making and operationalizing ethical practices for \nthe\
    \ flow of agricultural data.  \nThe online platform can play a critical role in\
    \ creating a dialogue among stakeholders \nand finding solutions that address\
    \ the needs and interests of all parties involved. In the \nwords of Andre Laperriere,\
    \ Executive Director of GODAN, “Codes of conduct help \ninclude smallholder farmers\
    \ in decision making, policy design, and enhancement of \nprivacy protection and\
    \ trust, as well as providing considerable economic and health \nbenefits.” \n\
    U.S. Data Cooperatives  \nThere are several companies in the U.S. that offer data\
    \ services and solutions to the \nagriculture sector, including collaborative\
    \ agribusiness models such as data cooperatives51 \nand data pools. Six major\
    \ organizations in the United States serve as intermediaries in \nagricultural\
    \ data management. These organizations include the Ag Data Coalition (ADC), \n\
    the Grower Information Services Cooperative (GiSC), the Farmers Business Network\
    \ \n(FBN), and the most recent federally funded initiative of the United States\
    \ Department of \nAgriculture, the National Agricultural Producers Data Cooperative\

    \ the Agricultural Research Data Network (ARDN); and \nData Commons. \n \n89 \n\
    Organization Description \ninformation source, this network guarantees transparency\
    \ and fairness \nas values when dealing with ag data. \nNAPDC \nIt is defined\
    \ as a project. The overall goal of this project is to develop a \nblueprint for\
    \ a national data framework and cooperative where \nproducers, universities, and\
    \ not-for-profit entities can store and share \ndata and develop powerful tools\
    \ that enable producers to maximize \ntheir production and profitability. The\
    \ NAPDC will develop a \nblueprint for a national agricultural producers’ data\
    \ framework; engage \nand support diverse participation including all types of\
    \ agricultural \nresearch institutions, producers, and representatives of a relevant\
    \ data \nproducer and end-user organizations; and communicate and \ndisseminate\
    \ findings of all activities through publications, peer-\nreviewed articles, and\
    \ presentations to scientific and producer groups. \nThese companies function\
    \ as independent data aggregation platforms that share \nagronomic precision data\
    \ with a common goal of creating a secure system for processing \nagricultural\
    \ data efficiently. They offer centralized locations for managing all agricultural\
    \ \ndata. For instance, GiSC offers the AgHub tool, which collects and securely\
    \ stores all \nagricultural data from digital technologies such as tractors, sprayers,\
    \ sensors, and drones.  \nThese cooperatives emphasize a farmer-first approach\
    \ and claim to be an \"independent, \nunbiased, and objective farmer-driven information\
    \ source,\" as stated on the FBN53 website. \nOthers, like Open Ag Data Alliance,\
    \ create \"a secure data ecosystem that enables data \nsecurity, privacy, and\
    \ interoperability for the entire agriculture industry\"54 through open \nsoftware\
    \ available to farmers. These six data cooperatives mentioned are only examples\
    \ of \n \n53 More information available at: https://www.fbn.com/about \n54 Information\
    \ available at: http://openag.io/principles/ \n \n90 \npotential opportunities\
    \ to create new entities that address the ever-increasing volume of \nagricultural\
    \ data challenges for farmers.  \nIn conclusion, data cooperatives and other data\
    \ intermediaries are emerging as key \nplayers in the agriculture sector. These\
    \ organizations offer secure and centralized platforms \nto manage agricultural\
    \ data, provide oversight and transparency over the use of data \nentrusted to\
    \ them. Moving forward, the continued growth and success of these data \ncooperatives\
    \ will depend on their ability to maintain trust among all stakeholders, \nparticularly\
    \ farmers, and to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological landscape\
    \ in \nthe agriculture sector. \nU.S. National and State-Level Laws and Regulations\
    \ \nThe policy landscape and legal framework regulating agricultural data governance\
    \ in \nthe United States reveals challenges and uncertainties. Although there\
    \ are regulatory bill \ninitiatives, none of them aim to set industry-specific\
    \ norms for data flow, sharing, privacy, \nand security. Modernization and innovation\
    \ of agricultural data infrastructure at the public \ninstitutional level, such\
    \ as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is still pending. \nThe Agriculture\
    \ Improvement Act (P.L. 115-334), also known as the “2018 Farm bill,” \nwas signed\
    \ into law in December 2018 and will remain in effect until 2023 (McMinimy et\
    \ \nal., 2019). This Act was part of the U.S. Congress's periodic agricultural\
    \ policy revisions \nthat largely extended “agricultural commodity support programs\
    \ along existing lines while \nmodifying them in various ways” (McMinimy et al.,\
    \ 2019, p.1). The major changes focused \non reallocating funding across agriculture\
    \ and food programs. \n \n91 \nThe farm Bill 2018 responds to a periodic regulatory\
    \ revision that addresses a wide \nrange of agricultural and food-related issues;\
    \ for instance, issues related to “agricultural \nconservation, credit, rural\
    \ development, domestic nutrition assistance, trade and \ninternational food aid,\
    \ organic agriculture, forestry…” (McMinimy et al.,2019, p. 1) among \nothers.\
    \ One of the new Farm Bill 2018 provisions is the extension of support for urban\
    \ \nagricultural programs as well as the creation of new and specific authorities\
    \ (Janzen, 2018). \nHowever, the modifications in the law did not address the\
    \ issue of agricultural data \ngovernance, including standards, safeguards and\
    \ enabler mechanisms, or processes to \nmanage it in a way that farmers could\
    \ easily access information they reported themselves \nvia a single platform.\
    \ \nDespite these challenges, the USDA has made progress in recent years. For\
    \ example, \nthe 2014 Farm Bill mandated the Acreage Crop Reporting Streamlining\
    \ Initiative (ACRSI), \naimed at reducing the burden of data submission for farmers\
    \ and preventing duplication of \ndata received in various department programs\
    \ (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 7). ACRSI has \nestablished a standardized framework\
    \ for farmers to report acreage data to the USDA. The \ninstitutional role of\
    \ USDA is to develop and publish reporting standards for the framework \nas part\
    \ of the initiative. \nAccording to Ristino & Hart (2022, p.7), ACRSI data is\
    \ shared electronically and \nsecurely between farmers and relevant program areas.\
    \ ACRSI demonstrates the benefits \nand value of creating data standards that\
    \ facilitate more efficient, secure, and accurate data \nsharing across the USDA\
    \ (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 7). However, the disconnect between \nUSDA agencies\
    \ promotes institutional silos, making the integration, sharing, and use of \n\
    agricultural data even more difficult. \n \n92 \nIn 2018, the USDA established\
    \ a Chief Data Officer (CDO) and assistant Data Officers \nin each mission to\
    \ improve data governance practices within the agency. This institutional \nmodification\
    \ resulted in the creation of the Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset\
    \ \n(EDAPT). EDAPT connects data from 150 sources, both internal and external,\
    \ to provide \na comprehensive collection of administrative data and a standardized\
    \ set of centrally \navailable data analytics tools. The department-wide dashboard\
    \ created a more data-focused \nculture, building technical and leadership capacity\
    \ and inspiring other CDOs to develop \nsimilar platforms within their agencies\
    \ (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 7). \nThe USDA's development of the Data Strategy\
    \ for 2021-2023 represents a recent effort \nto tackle the challenges of governing\
    \ agricultural data within the agency. The Strategy's \nfirst goal is focused\
    \ on Data Governance and Leadership. In line with this, the USDA \nreleased the\
    \ USDA Data Act Governance and POC Charter in 2019. The Act seeks to \nenhance\
    \ data quality within the agency by establishing governance processes, protocols,\
    \ \nroles and responsibilities, and rules for accessing, controlling, and sharing\
    \ data within the \nagency's structural organization. The USDA's growing awareness\
    \ of data issues and its \ncritical institutional role in promoting the benefits\
    \ of effective use of agricultural data \nhighlights the importance of continuing\
    \ efforts to modernize and enhance data governance \nin the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nIn 2018, Senators Amy Klobuchar and John Thune introduced the Agricultural\
    \ Data Act \n(Ag-Data Act, 115th Congress, 2017-2018), a bipartisan bill aimed\
    \ at streamlining the \ncollection and sharing of agricultural data for the benefit\
    \ of U.S. agriculture producers. The \nprimary goal of the bill was to increase\
    \ knowledge about how conservation practices \nimpact farm and ranch profitability\
    \ and soil health by collecting, reviewing, and analyzing \n \n93 \ndata. The\
    \ bill intended to make USDA data available to researchers and land grant \nuniversities\
    \ to encourage the study of conservation practices and their effects on farm \n\
    profitability and soil health (Janzen, 2018a). \nAccording to Janzen (2018a),\
    \ the purpose of this bill is to streamline agricultural data \ncollection within\
    \ the USDA and make it available for research purposes to land grant \nuniversities\
    \ and other organizations. \nAt the state level, Minnesota's legal regulations\
    \ identify the various types of agricultural \ndata in the public sector. However,\
    \ they do not provide a description of the rules, norms, \nor processes to access,\
    \ share, and use such public data. In 2020, Chapter 13 outlined the \nGovernment\
    \ Data practices, and Section 13.643 and 13.6435 specifically deal with \nAgricultural\
    \ Data types. Table 13 below provides a detailed description of the content of\

    \ 4 of Section 13.6435, \"agricultural applications; protection of trade \nsecrets,\"\
    \ is a significant step towards addressing legal issues and disputes related to\
    \ ag data. \nHowever, Ellixson & Griffin (2016, p.2) point out that as of 2016,\
    \ there were no laws \ncovering the ownership of agricultural data or the consequences\
    \ of misusing that data. \n \n95 \nThe agricultural sector's national and public\
    \ data infrastructure is essential for providing \ncritical agricultural insights,\
    \ improving the effectiveness of farm bill programs, and \noffering better value\
    \ to farmers and taxpayers (Ristino & Hart, 2022). To address these \nissues,\
    \ the AGree Initiative, Three Canyon Farms, Data Foundation, University of Missouri\
    \ \nCenter for Regenerative Agriculture, and the Meridian Institute collaborated\
    \ on the \nwebinar, \"Models for Modernizing Agriculture Data Infrastructure:\
    \ Lessons Learned from \nData Innovation in Other Sectors\" on June 9, 2022. They\
    \ discussed the recently published \nreport, \"Modernizing Agriculture Data Infrastructure\
    \ to Improve Economic and Ecological \nOutcomes,\" which outlines four practical\
    \ options for modernizing the USDA's data \ninfrastructure to adapt, innovate,\
    \ and ensure food security in the future (Ristino & Hart, \n2022). Figure 17 illustrates\
    \ these four models. \nFigure 17 Four Models to Modernize the USDA Agricultural\
    \ Data Infrastructure \nAdapted from (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 3) \nThe current\
    \ USDA data infrastructure is struggling to assist farmers in addressing \nchallenges,\
    \ such as the extreme weather events that caused the Midwest floods in 2019, \n\
    disruptions in global supply chains like those experienced in 2021, and the rising\
    \ prices of \nfertilizers (Ristino & Hart, 2022). Adopting one of the four proposed\
    \ models could help \n \n96 \nimprove the low institutional performance of the\
    \ USDA in assisting agriculture digital \ntransformation.  \nA centralized model\
    \ for data infrastructure, operated within the USDA, could provide \nreliable\
    \ data standards and build trustworthy systems for farmers and other stakeholders.\
    \ \nHowever, Ristino and Hart (2022, p. 3) argue that due to the USDA’s limited\
    \ infrastructure \ncapacity and heavy inter-institutional regulations, this model\
    \ may be impractical.  \nThe second model proposes centralizing the data infrastructure\
    \ under a public-private \npartnership. This model combines the appeal of enabling\
    \ government authorities for data \nprotection and resources with the flexibility\
    \ of the private sector, including its ability to \nprotect proprietary information.\
    \  \nA third model involves designing a data linkage hub. Ristino & Hart (2022)\
    \ state that \nongoing discussions are underway to determine the benefits of this\
    \ model. It would provide \na highly secure environment for integrating data with\
    \ some usage restrictions. \nThe final model proposes a contractual approach,\
    \ which is sensitive and requires \ncoordination and negotiations with farmers\
    \ regarding the economic contractual rates \n(Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 14). This\
    \ approach requires clear incentives to compensate \npartners or data providers\
    \ for data exchange and transactions. \nWhile not prescriptive, these four models\
    \ offer potential solutions to the challenges \nfacing the USDA agency's data\
    \ practices. In a webinar featuring speakers such as Robert \nBlair, president\
    \ of Three Canyon Farms, it was noted that farmers have a distrust of data \n\
    reporting and that the USDA is falling behind in terms of data practices in the\
    \ information \nage (Atwood et al., 2022). Blair emphasized the need for the USDA\
    \ to modernize its \n \n97 \ninfrastructure to collect and promote data flow among\
    \ farmers and other USDA agencies. \nAgriculture stakeholders recognize the importance\
    \ of using data to improve food safety \nand security at a macro level. \nThe\
    \ four proposed models for modernizing the USDA's data infrastructure system offer\
    \ \nan opportunity to build trust and collaboration between farmers and other\
    \ stakeholders in \nthe agriculture sector, as well as unlock economic opportunities\
    \ by leveraging data value. \nFor example, better information about farms' productivity\
    \ and risk can help address \ndynamic weather and economic challenges (Ristino\
    \ & Hart, 2022, p. 4) and researchers \ncould use data to understand how different\
    \ farming practices affect productivity and \nenvironmental outcomes, which can\
    \ enable ecosystem markets. \nHowever, while these models address the issue at\
    \ the meso-institutional level, governing \nagricultural data at the macro sector\
    \ level remains a challenge. Private agribusiness firms \nare already using data\
    \ to make production decisions and promote carbon markets, and \nagricultural\
    \ machinery manufacturers are connecting equipment to the cloud for real-time\
    \ \ndata collection. Meanwhile, the USDA's data infrastructure has stalled, hindering\
    \ its ability \nto support farmers and enhance program performance. \nLesson Drawing\
    \ and Benchmarking \nThis section summarizes the main lessons, best practices,\
    \ and benchmarks drawn from \nthe examination of existing regulatory frameworks\
    \ for data governance in the U.S., other \ncountries, other sectors, and Europe.\
    \ Lesson-drawing is a process that requires more than \njust highlighting successful\
    \ examples of current programs or processes addressing similar \n \n98 \nproblems\
    \ elsewhere. As Rose (1991, p. 19) notes, it also requires examination of under\
    \ \nwhat conditions and to what extent a current program or process would work\
    \ elsewhere. \nOne lesson to draw from the codes of practice is the importance\
    \ of agricultural data \ndefinitions. While the U.S. code of practice does not\
    \ explicitly describe the types of data \ncovered by the set of principles, the\
    \ codes from New Zealand and the European Union do \nso to varying degrees. The\
    \ EU COP provides a comprehensive list of definitions that \naccurately describe\
    \ the scope of all three codes55 (van der Burg et al., 2021), including the \n\
    importance of data originators56 having control over their data. \nOne of the\
    \ strengths of codes of practice (COPs) is that they are principle-based and \n\
    reflect what the industry considers good practice in agricultural data management\
    \ \n(Wiseman et al., 2019, p. 11). Instead of prescribing specific processes or\
    \ actions, COPs \nfocus on the desired outcomes of data practices. This approach\
    \ emphasizes consent, \ndisclosure, and transparency in data practices through\
    \ contractual agreements rather than \ndictating how agribusinesses should manage\
    \ their data. \nAnother lesson learned from examining the COPs, is the importance\
    \ of the Australian \nData Rules, which provide an action-oriented program for\
    \ capacity building, training, and \nrisk management. Figure 18 summarizes these\
    \ regulatory lessons drawn from the COPs, \nwhich are concise and relevant to\
    \ the proposed data governance framework. \n \n55 EU code definition of agricultural\
    \ data: “data related to agricultural production, including farm data and \nall\
    \ types of data generated within the farming processes”  \n56 Data originator:\
    \ “the person or entity with the exclusive right to license data access and control\
    \ its \ndownstream use and re-use.” Definition from the EU Code of Conduct (p.6).\
    \ \n \n99 \nFigure 18 Agricultural Data Governance Policy Framework: regulatory\
    \ dimensions and \nattributes to design the policy options \n \nAdapted from Chen,\
    \ 2021 \nFurthermore, benchmarking allows for the comparison and measurement of\
    \ standards \nand strategies that can foster trust and transparency. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley\
    \ Act \n(GLBA)57 is a significant example not only because it established data\
    \ handling standards, \nbut also because it expanded consumer rights. Customers\
    \ now have the right to access their \n“nonpublic personal information (NPI)58”\
    \ at any time, increasing transparency between \nconsumers and financial institutions.\
    \ This increase in transparency has given consumers \n \n57 Gramm-Leach-Bliley\
    \ Act, Pub. L. No. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999). \n58 Nonpublic personal information\
    \ refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual and \n\
    is not available to the public. Examples of NPI include a person's name, address,\
    \ social security number, \ncredit card number, and financial account information.\
    \ GLBA requires financial institutions to disclose \ntheir policies for collecting,\
    \ sharing, and protecting NPI, and to give customers the right to opt out of \n\
    having their NPI shared with third parties. \n \n100 \nthe ability to control\
    \ how their data is handled and to opt out of sharing information with \nthird\
    \ parties. \nSimilarly, the U.S. HIPAA59 regulation sets rules and standards governing\
    \ the privacy \nand security of personal health data in the country. By establishing\
    \ compliance and security \nrules, HIPAA ensures a reliable flow of health and\
    \ personal data. For instance, it defines \nthe roles and responsibilities of\
    \ institutions providing healthcare and health insurance \ncompanies to protect\
    \ patients' personal information. \nTo encourage innovation, best practices for\
    \ agricultural data management should \nprioritize implementing data governance\
    \ strategies such as defining roles and \nresponsibilities for decisions involving\
    \ agricultural data, promoting data sharing, building \ntrust in data collection,\
    \ use, and sharing, and ensuring adequate safeguards against the risks \nassociated\
    \ with data misuse. \nIn the US, data cooperatives have emerged to address the\
    \ lack of proper management \nand utilization of the data collected, as well as\
    \ the absence of a standardized comprehensive \nsecurity system for the flow of\
    \ agricultural data. While these cooperatives offer a variety \nof digital solutions,\
    \ an agricultural data governance framework should aim to simplify data \nexchange\
    \ between companies, farmers, and the public sector. It should provide a \ncomprehensive\
    \ solution to the vulnerability of agricultural data to breaches and cyber-\n\
    attacks. \n \n59 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,\
    \ Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 \n(1996). \n \n101 \nPolicy Options Design\
    \ \nThis research proposes three policy alternatives or options60 as potential\
    \ solutions to \naddress the policy problem of agricultural data governance in\
    \ the U.S. A well-designed \npolicy should have clear, specific, and consistent\
    \ goals, with links to the targeted behavior \nof the population, and ultimately\
    \ the desired outcomes (Schneider, 1997, p. 35). The policy \nalternatives proposed\
    \ in this research are tailored to the data governance pillars, which \ninclude\
    \ safeguards and enablers, as per the legal data governance framework presented\
    \ by \nWDR21 (World Bank, 2021), that encompass various types of data and stakeholders.\
    \ \nFigure 19 illustrates the policy design components considered in the formulation\
    \ of the \npolicy alternatives. \nFigure 19 Components of Policy Design \n \n\
    Adapted from (Schneider, 1997) \nTools and rules are procedural aspects of policy\
    \ design that specify who is responsible \nfor what, where, and when (Schneider,\
    \ 1997, p. 97) in order to achieve certain benefits, \nsuch as capacity-building\
    \ or providing incentives for action. Rationales and assumptions \nare explanations\
    \ or reasons for the design decisions made, such as the choice of target \npopulation,\
    \ tools, rules, and goals (Schneider, 1997, p. 99). The rationale connects the\

    \ that produces specific consequences \nor effects (Stone, 2012, p. 225). The\
    \ policy alternatives were developed based on a comparative analysis of \nexisting\
    \ data governance frameworks described in this chapter. \n \n102 \npolicy elements\
    \ to the context, making explicit claims that the design is responsive to the\
    \ \nproblem and will have a positive impact. Assumptions are the underlying logic\
    \ that \nconnects the selected elements together. Policy goals and problems to\
    \ be solved are \nintentional aspects of policy design. These are expressed in\
    \ objective and technical terms, \nbut they represent desired outcomes. They can\
    \ be broadly defined and framed in terms of \npublic interest or narrowly defined\
    \ and framed to affect only specific groups (Schneider, \n1997). \nDesigning a\
    \ data governance policy framework involves establishing guidance norms \nand\
    \ rules, data quality standards, defining roles and responsibilities for compliance\
    \ and \nsecurity, and promoting capacity building, particularly among farmers.\
    \ The overall \nobjective is to develop a policy that governs the flow of agricultural\
    \ data while promoting \ntrust and transparency among all stakeholders. \nAn agricultural\
    \ data policy should be drafted as \"principle-based and technologically \nneutral\
    \ laws and regulations... [to] help them remain relevant as technologies evolve\
    \ and \nreduce compliance burdens” (World Bank, 2021, p. 191), which means creating\
    \ an \nadaptable policy. A data governance policy framework requires government\
    \ agencies in \nthe agriculture sector to act not only as regulators but also\
    \ as investors in good data \npractices that can generate value from agricultural\
    \ data. \nAn expert judgement from the international institution, OECD, and its\
    \ report \"Digital \nOpportunities for Better Agricultural Policies\" (OECD, 2019),\
    \ states that governments \nshould take the lead in improving access to agricultural\
    \ data. One key role of the \ngovernment in micro/farm level agricultural data\
    \ is to enable the ability to link datasets \n \n103 \nwhile preserving confidentiality\
    \ as necessary (Sanderson et al., 2018). The \nrecommendations of OECD (2019)\
    \ have been synthesized in Table 14. \nTable 14 Government role and what they\
    \ should do \nPublic \norganizations/institutions \nFunctions/roles (what needs\
    \ to be done…) \nGovernment agencies: \nstatistical agencies, \nadministrative\

    \ to agricultural micro data. \nTo explore ways to incentivize provision of private\
    \ \nsector data for public use and for agricultural \nresearch; options include\

    \ data management frameworks which \ninclude methodologies for the evaluation\
    \ of data \nquality for data from alternative sources and \nplanning. \nAdapted\
    \ from OECD (2019) “Digital Opportunities for Better Agricultural Policies” \n\
    The data governance framework includes safeguards to protect personal data and\
    \ \nbalance the interests of data reuse and non-personal data. Enablers promote\
    \ mechanisms \nfor data sharing and incentivize both the public and private sector\
    \ to use and reuse data. \nThe framework also defines roles and responsibilities\
    \ for creating an environment that \nfosters education on digital technologies\
    \ and their implementation. The intended outcome \nis to create robust and adaptable\
    \ data governance regulations that include safeguards to \nprevent the misuse\
    \ of data, as well as enablers that facilitate access to and use of data. \nFigure\
    \ 20 captures the components of the data governance framework for each policy\
    \ \noption in this research. In order to integrate the role of institutions, the\
    \ \"roles and \nresponsibilities\" pillar is an additional component of each policy\
    \ option data governance \nframework. Outcomes are added to the policy options\
    \ design to serve as an analysis \ncriterion for each of them. \n \n105 \nFigure\
    \ 20 Components of policy design for agricultural data governance policy options\
    \ \n \nSafeguards are an essential component of a data governance policy framework,\
    \ as they \nprovide mechanisms and processes to create a secure environment for\
    \ accessing and using \npersonal and non-personal data. They support individuals'\
    \ agency to control their data, \nensuring their data rights to give consent to\
    \ the use of personal data (World Bank, 2021, p. \n191), such as farmers' addresses\
    \ and identification numbers, or third-party access to non-\npersonal data, such\
    \ as crop production. The goal of these norms is to ensure data security \nand\
    \ promote trustworthiness. \nThe inclusion of safeguards in the policy options\
    \ design is crucial due to the concern of \npower asymmetries arising from a data\
    \ control approach, rather than a data ownership \nperspective. Therefore, safeguards\
    \ are established in the form of substantive rights, such \nas preventing unauthorized\
    \ disclosure or unfair use of personal and non-personal data, and \nprocedural\
    \ rights that promote transparency and accountability, such as the right to receive\
    \ \nnotice, object to data usage, and access, correct, or erase data (World Bank,\
    \ 2021, p. 194). \n \n106 \nEnabling norms and rules for the good practice of\
    \ data use and reuse are a fundamental \npillar of a data governance framework.\
    \ Enablers are primarily analyzed based on the \ndomain of the data, i.e., whether\
    \ the data are generated or controlled by the public or private \nsector, or both\
    \ (World Bank, 2021, p. 199). \nInstitutions play a critical role in implementing\
    \ regulations. They have distinct values, \nnorms, and operating procedures that\
    \ define their culture (Schneider, 1997, p. 76). The \nUSDA is the federal agency\
    \ responsible for the agriculture sector, and it has the potential \nto modernize\
    \ its structure to support sector data governance and promote a data-driven \n\
    culture within the sector. \nIncorporating justice as a central standard in policy\
    \ design can create an institutional \ndata-driven and digital technology culture\
    \ that serves the interests and principles of \ndistributive justice (Schneider,\
    \ 1997, p. 64). To achieve desired outcomes, policy design \nshould target specific\
    \ populations (Schneider, 1997, p. 35). The goal of an agricultural data \ngovernance\
    \ policy framework is to create strong and resilient policy options that can adapt\
    \ \nto the rapid and ongoing evolution of IR 4.0 technologies such as AI, IoT,\
    \ and ICTs. Such \na framework should also be able to deal with multi-stakeholder\
    \ conflicts over the medium-\nto-long term (Howlett, 2019, p. 28). \nTo achieve\
    \ both robustness and resilience in policy design, Howlett (2019, p. 30) \nsuggests\
    \ the need to design and adopt policies that feature agility and flexibility in\
    \ their \ncomponents and processes. Therefore, institutions' role in policy design\
    \ is to determine the \nnecessary robustness and resilience to respond to the\
    \ need for a mutually influencing co-\nevolution of technology and regulatory\
    \ frameworks. \n \n107 \nAfter considering all these factors in proposing an agricultural\
    \ data governance \nframework, this research presents three policy options: minimalist,\
    \ moderate, and \nmaximalist. Table 15 summarizes these three policy alternatives,\
    \ including the rules, \nnorms, degree of intervention by institutions, goals,\

    \ is a data \ngovernance solution integrating data governance level 1 and 2 and\
    \ considering the rights \non and of data at the national level, i.e., a data\
    \ governance act for agricultural data. \n▪ \nOption 1: Minimalist \nThe purpose\
    \ of the minimalist policy approach is to address the issue of mistrust in \n\
    current agricultural data practices through contractual agreements between farmers\
    \ and \nproviders. This option is minimal in its scope as it aims to transform\
    \ the voluntary nature \nof the U.S. Code of Practice (COP) and involve agriculture\
    \ institutions and agencies in \n \n109 \nimplementing processes and mechanisms\
    \ to oversee and evaluate Agriculture Tech \nProviders (ATPs) and other agribusinesses\
    \ that carry a data transparent logo. The goal is \nto ensure that ATPs adhere\
    \ to ethical data practices and provide transparency in their data \nsharing agreements\
    \ with farmers. \nIntended goal: to shift the agricultural sector's mindset towards\
    \ agricultural data \ngovernance, grounded in the U.S. core principles for data\
    \ practices. \nThe goal of the minimalist policy approach is to shift the agricultural\
    \ sector's mindset \ntowards agricultural data governance by transforming the\
    \ voluntary self-regulated set of \nguidelines and principles in the U.S. COP\
    \ into a legal normative data framework that \ngoverns decision-making on agricultural\
    \ data sharing. Government agriculture agencies \nwould play an intervening role\
    \ in supervising the process for obtaining a data transparent \nlogo, seal, or\
    \ trademark and establishing a standardized agreement model specific to the \n\
    agricultural sector in the U.S. In essence, the goal is to achieve a more meaningful\
    \ model \nof consent for using and reusing agricultural data between the private\
    \ and public sectors \nand farmers in the modern digital age. \nEnabling trustworthy\
    \ data operations is crucial for promoting transparent agricultural \ndata practices\
    \ based on the U.S. Code of Practice and the Core Principles. \nThis requires\
    \ implementing technical and organizational measures to ensure data \nintegrity,\
    \ security, and privacy, such as data encryption, access controls, and audit trails.\
    \ \nMoreover, it involves fostering a culture of transparency and accountability\
    \ in data \noperations, which includes informing data subjects about data collection\
    \ and processing \nactivities, obtaining their consent when necessary, and providing\
    \ them with access to their \ndata and the means to correct or delete it. By enabling\
    \ such data operations, the agricultural \n \n110 \nsector can enhance trust among\
    \ stakeholders and promote the responsible use and reuse of \nagricultural data.\
    \ \nA good starting point is to make the U.S. COP's \"core principles\" legally\
    \ binding, as \nthey have been defined and agreed upon by farmers61 to improve\
    \ agricultural data \ngovernance practices. These core principles set rules and\
    \ standards for data sharing, use, \nand reuse, and can help determine the roles\
    \ and responsibilities of the USDA and its \nsubagencies, as well as establish\
    \ a standardized classification of agricultural data types for \nuse in contractual\
    \ agreements. To encourage compliance, the USDA can supervise the \nprocess of\
    \ obtaining a trademark or logo from ATPs and agri-businesses committed to \n\
    promoting transparent data practices. Regulations and institutional interventions\
    \ can also \nhelp foster trust and encourage compliance behaviors, as unified\
    \ data classification is a key \nenabler of data reuse (World Bank, 2021, p. 202).\
    \ \nEnablers to data interoperability & integration for making attractive incentives\
    \ for \npublic and private intent data sharing  \nData interoperability and integration\
    \ can enable the seamless exchange of data between \ndifferent systems, applications,\
    \ and stakeholders in the agricultural sector. This can be \nachieved by adopting\
    \ standard data formats, APIs, and protocols for data sharing, use, and \nreuse.\
    \ Several enablers can promote data interoperability and integration: \n- \nOpen\
    \ data standards: Open data standards can enable data to be shared and \nintegrated\
    \ across different platforms, applications, and stakeholders. Standards \n \n\
    61 Farmers who are part of or participate through the American Farm Bureau Federation\
    \ (AFBF) \n \n111 \nsuch as the AgGateway ADAPT framework can facilitate interoperability\
    \ among \nprecision agriculture devices and software systems. \n- \nIncentives\
    \ for data sharing: Public and private sector actors can be incentivized to \n\
    share and integrate data through financial, social, and technical means. For \n\
    instance, government subsidies, tax credits, or grants can encourage data sharing\
    \ \namong farmers, while social recognition, reputation, or peer pressure can\
    \ motivate \nprivate sector actors to share data. \n- \nData intermediaries: Data\
    \ intermediaries can act as trusted third parties to \nfacilitate data sharing\
    \ and integration among different stakeholders. \nIntermediaries such as farm\
    \ management software providers or agricultural \ncooperatives can aggregate and\
    \ harmonize data from different sources, ensuring \ndata quality, security, and\
    \ privacy. \n- \nData analytics: Advanced analytics tools such as AI, machine\
    \ learning, and \npredictive modeling can help integrate and derive insights from\
    \ disparate data \nsources, enabling better decision-making and value creation\
    \ for all stakeholders \ninvolved. \nThe overall goal of a data governance framework\
    \ in the agriculture sector is to \nincentivize trustworthy mechanisms for data\
    \ sharing, both public and private. In addition \nto legally recognizing core\
    \ principles, agriculture agencies need to modernize and create \ngovernment data\
    \ exchange platforms to ensure data interoperability. This will create \nopportunities\
    \ to open certain types of public intent data for exchange and create incentives\
    \ \nwhile removing barriers to voluntary data sharing involving private sector\
    \ actors such as \nATPs and data cooperatives. The value of agricultural data\
    \ can benefit multiple \n \n112 \nstakeholders, and guidelines or standard contractual\
    \ provisions should be formulated to \ngovern the fairness of terms of use. \n\
    Roles and responsibilities for data quality and compliance for shaping the agriculture\
    \ \ndata economy to continue in the path of the digital transformation \nTo ensure\
    \ the development of a thriving agricultural data economy, roles and \nresponsibilities\
    \ for data quality and compliance must be clearly defined and implemented. \n\
    This requires a concerted effort from both the public and private sectors. Government\
    \ \nagencies, such as the USDA, can play a key role in developing and enforcing\
    \ data \nstandards. This includes establishing mechanisms to monitor and ensure\
    \ compliance with \nthe current U.S. COP62 principles and guidelines. \nPrivate\
    \ sector entities, such as ATPs and data cooperatives, have a responsibility to\
    \ \nuphold these standards and ensure that the data they collect and share is\
    \ of high quality and \nmeets established guidelines. This includes implementing\
    \ data quality control measures, \nsuch as data validation and verification processes,\
    \ to ensure that the data is accurate and \nreliable. \nTo increase transparency\
    \ and trust between farmers, ATPs, and other third parties, a \nmodel of adaptable\
    \ contractual agreements overseen by agriculture agencies should be \ndeveloped.\
    \ Rules are necessary to enforce compliance with contractual agreements, and \n\
    public agencies can assist in policing and enforcing them effectively. One of\
    \ the specific \nroles of these institutions could be to monitor and evaluate\
    \ trademark usage and provide \n \n62 The goal of legally and bindingly regulating\
    \ the current U.S. COP is to reduce the \"digital divide\" \nbetween those who\
    \ have knowledge (i.e., ag. tech service providers) and those who do not, through\
    \ the \nimplementation of transparent and fair data sharing practices. \n \n113\
    \ \ncontinuous feedback loops to promote sector engagement, learning, and improvement.\
    \ It is \nessential to set roles and responsibilities within agriculture agencies\
    \ at the federal and state \nlevels to govern data governance in the U.S. effectively.\
    \ Overall, clear roles and \nresponsibilities are essential for shaping the agriculture\
    \ data economy in a way that fosters \ninnovation, growth, and sustainability.\
    \ \n▪ \nOption 2: Moderate \nA moderate policy option aims to address the agricultural\
    \ data governance problem in \nthe U.S. by proposing the development of trustworthy\
    \ systems. This involves not only \noverseeing the COP and evaluating ATPs and\
    \ agri-businesses carrying a data transparent \nlogo but also creating public\
    \ institutional capacity to introduce safeguards and enablers that \nensure data\
    \ rights and facilitate cross-border sector data sharing, while also ensuring\
    \ \ncompliance with regulatory requirements. \nIntended goal: To create a data\
    \ governance trustworthy and transparent environment \nby regulating agricultural\
    \ data rights and obligations of parties involved in data \npractices and transactions\
    \ \nThe intended goal of a moderate policy option is to establish a transparent\
    \ and \ntrustworthy data governance system for the agricultural sector by defining\
    \ the data security \nresponsibilities of parties involved in transactions through\
    \ contractual agreements. The \nUSDA should have an effective and independent\
    \ role in ensuring data security, including \nregistering data intermediary companies.\
    \ Data intermediaries can facilitate safe data \nsharing and use, promoting equitable\
    \ access to data and its value (World Bank, 2021, p. \n265). The agency can monitor\
    \ the implementation of data rights, including privacy and \n \n114 \nsecurity,\
    \ and handle complaints about legal violations. This role could increase trust\
    \ in data \npractices among agricultural stakeholders.  \nSafeguards for appropriated\
    \ data security conditions for cross-sector border exchange \nof agricultural\
    \ data  \nAppropriate data security conditions are essential for promoting cross-border\
    \ exchange \nof agricultural data. One of the safeguards that can be established\
    \ are agricultural-specific \ndata privacy and security rules and regulations.\
    \ The USDA could work with stakeholders \nto develop such rules and regulations\
    \ that take into account the unique aspects of \nagricultural data, such as farm\
    \ location and practices, and ensure that data is handled \nappropriately. \n\
    Furthermore, the USDA could require data intermediaries and ATPs to undergo regular\
    \ \nsecurity audits and assessments to ensure that they are complying with data\
    \ security \nregulations and standards. The agency could also establish penalties\
    \ for non-compliance to \ndeter ATPs and intermediaries from engaging in risky\
    \ data practices. \nIn addition, the USDA could promote the use of data encryption\
    \ and other security \nmeasures to protect data during transmission and storage.\
    \ This could be accomplished \nthrough the creation of guidelines and recommendations\
    \ for farmers and other stakeholders \non how to securely transmit and store agricultural\
    \ data. \nTo promote cross-border data exchange, it is important to consider the\
    \ impact on the \ncountry's competitiveness and international trade opportunities.\
    \ In order to ensure \nappropriate data security conditions for cross-sector data\
    \ flows, it may be necessary to \nadopt provisions criminalizing unauthorized\
    \ or illegal access to infrastructure, systems, and \n \n115 \ndata. Government\
    \ agencies in the agriculture sector should also consider implementing \nregulatory\
    \ approaches that ensure adequacy and accountability, including specific \nconditions\
    \ that permit data transfer, mutual agreements, and schemes to require, permit,\
    \ or \nlimit cross-border data transfers. \nATPs and other third parties providing\
    \ services cannot engage in data exchange without \na trustworthy system or environment.\
    \ Trust in the data sharing system depends on people's \nconfidence that others\
    \ will follow the rules and agreements, and that there is an authority \nenforcing\
    \ those rules and agreements. In the agriculture sector, in order to build trust\
    \ in the \ndata sharing system, privacy and security should be guaranteed, as\
    \ well as benefits for all \nparties involved. \nEnabling data operations for\
    \ data cooperatives and data integration for an \nAgricultural Data Governance\
    \ and Accreditation Board (a data governance body) \nTo enable data operations\
    \ for data cooperatives, it is necessary to establish data \ngovernance and accreditation\
    \ boards that can provide guidance on data management \npractices, promote interoperability,\
    \ and foster data sharing within the agricultural sector. \nSuch boards can also\
    \ provide technical and policy support to data cooperatives, helping \nthem to\
    \ develop and maintain data management systems that are consistent with industry\
    \ \nstandards and best practices. \nThe integration of data from various sources\
    \ is essential for achieving the full potential \nof data cooperatives. Data integration\
    \ involves the process of combining data from \ndifferent sources to create a\
    \ unified view of the data. This can be done using a variety of \ntools and techniques,\
    \ including data warehousing, data mining, and data modeling. \n \n116 \nAn Agricultural\
    \ Data Governance and Accreditation Board can help facilitate data \nintegration\
    \ by establishing data standards, providing guidance on data quality, and \npromoting\
    \ best practices for data management. The board can also serve as a central point\
    \ \nof contact for data sharing and collaboration among stakeholders in the agricultural\
    \ sector. \nA data governance board could be created or organized within the USDA\
    \ federal \nagency. This board would function as a steering committee, responsible\
    \ for overseeing the \ncollection, transfer, storage, and analysis of agricultural\
    \ data. ATPs, data intermediary \ncompanies, and data cooperatives would be required\
    \ to register with the board and \ncontribute to generating knowledge and advice,\
    \ as well as providing a feedback loop to \nfarmers and policymakers. This would\
    \ ensure that the board has a broad perspective on the \nindustry and can make\
    \ informed decisions about data governance. Additionally, the board \nwould be\
    \ responsible for establishing and enforcing standards for data quality, security,\
    \ \nand privacy. It would also be tasked with developing guidelines for data sharing\
    \ \nagreements and monitoring compliance with those agreements. This would create\
    \ a more \ncohesive and trustworthy data ecosystem for the agriculture sector,\
    \ increasing transparency \nand promoting collaboration between stakeholders.\
    \  \nTo ensure that private sector stakeholders act in the best interests of data\
    \ originators \nsuch as farmers and producers, the USDA Data Governance and Accreditation\
    \ Board could \nprovide guidance and oversight. These stakeholders could advise\
    \ data originators on the \npossible uses of their data and the terms and conditions\
    \ for such uses. Additionally, USDA \nagencies and data intermediary organizations\
    \ could collaborate to build capacity on data \ngovernance issues and provide\
    \ training on the importance of agricultural data and its \n \n117 \npotential\
    \ economic impact. An open-share data platform could also be developed to \nfacilitate\
    \ data sharing and collaboration between stakeholders in the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nOverall, the establishment of data governance and accreditation boards can\
    \ help ensure \nthat data cooperatives operate in a trustworthy and transparent\
    \ environment, with clear \nrules and responsibilities for data management and\
    \ sharing. This, in turn, can promote \ninnovation, facilitate data-driven decision-making,\
    \ and drive growth in the agricultural \nsector. \nRoles and responsibilities\
    \ of government agencies in strengthening technical data \ncapacity, communications,\
    \ and compliance as well as data literacy, to enable e-\ncommunication and e-transactions\
    \ \nThe government agencies have a critical role in strengthening technical data\
    \ capacity \nand data literacy to facilitate e-communication and e-transactions\
    \ in the agriculture sector. \nThis includes providing technical assistance to\
    \ farmers, ATPs, and other stakeholders in \nimplementing data governance best\
    \ practices, such as secure data sharing and compliance \nwith data privacy regulations.\
    \ \nThe government agencies also need to strengthen their own technical capacity\
    \ to oversee \nand enforce data governance policies and regulations. This can\
    \ involve the development of \nnew technologies or systems for monitoring and\
    \ auditing data practices, as well as the \nrecruitment of skilled personnel to\
    \ oversee data governance operations. \nIn addition, the government agencies should\
    \ play a role in promoting communication \nand collaboration among stakeholders\
    \ in the agriculture sector. This includes facilitating \n \n118 \nthe exchange\
    \ of best practices and promoting the adoption of data governance standards \n\
    across different sectors and regions. \nThe role of an agricultural data governance\
    \ and accreditation board is to evaluate and \naccredit ATPs and companies based\
    \ on their compliance with the core principles of the \nU.S. COP. In addition,\
    \ the board will establish a fee schedule for accreditations and \nrenewals and\
    \ will receive a complete checklist from organizations seeking accreditation.\
    \ \nFurthermore, the board will receive and address complaints from farmers and\
    \ primary \nproducers, as well as complying organizations, and will review all\
    \ cases of noncompliance \nand recommend corrective action. To sum up, the roles\
    \ and responsibilities of government \nagencies in improving technical data capacity,\
    \ communications, and compliance are \ncritical for ensuring the safe, secure,\
    \ and responsible use of agricultural data. \nThis moderate policy option aims\
    \ to promote a multi-stakeholder, purpose-driven \napproach to data management\
    \ and governance. The goal is to enable institutions to adapt \nto the rapidly\
    \ evolving digital data ecosystem while enhancing their legitimacy, \ntransparency,\
    \ and accountability. \n▪ \nOption 3: Maximalist \nThe maximalist policy option\
    \ seeks to fully embrace digitization in agriculture by \nestablishing a comprehensive\
    \ regulatory framework for data security, integration, and \ninteroperability.\
    \ This would involve developing national data governance standards, \nestablishing\
    \ clear rules and guidelines for data sharing, and incentivizing compliance with\
    \ \nthese rules through various means, such as tax breaks and subsidies. The goal\
    \ of this policy \n \n119 \noption is to create a secure and dynamic digital economy\
    \ that facilitates agricultural data \naccess, sharing, use, and re-use while\
    \ protecting data privacy and security. \nIntended goal: Integrate agricultural\
    \ data rights governing sharing and ownership, as \nwell as privacy and security\
    \ rights, while regulating data intermediaries and creating \nincentives for reusing\
    \ public administrative agricultural data. \nA comprehensive data governance framework\
    \ must be established to integrate \nagricultural data rights governing sharing\
    \ and ownership, as well as privacy and security \nrights, while regulating data\
    \ intermediaries and creating incentives for reusing public \nadministrative agricultural\
    \ data. This framework should include the following components: \n- \nClear definitions\
    \ of data rights, including ownership, control, and sharing rights, \nas well\
    \ as privacy and security rights. \n- \nRegulations for data intermediaries, including\
    \ data cooperatives and ATPs, that \nensure compliance with data privacy and security\
    \ regulations and that protect \nfarmers' and producers' data rights. \n- \nIncentives\
    \ for reusing public administrative agricultural data to increase the \nefficiency\
    \ and effectiveness of agricultural practices. \n- \nA mechanism for resolving\
    \ disputes related to data ownership and access, \nincluding the creation of a\
    \ data governance body that oversees the implementation \nof data governance policies\
    \ and ensures compliance. \n \n120 \nCreating an institutional environment as\
    \ a foundation for an ecosystem hub63 for \nagricultural data sharing involves\
    \ bringing together all relevant stakeholders and \nestablishing clear rules and\
    \ regulations governing agricultural data practices. This may \ninclude creating\
    \ incentives for data sharing, establishing data privacy and security \nprotocols,\
    \ and setting up a governance framework for data intermediaries. The ecosystem\
    \ \nhub can serve as a central point for sharing data and knowledge, facilitating\
    \ collaboration, \nand fostering innovation in the agricultural sector. By promoting\
    \ greater transparency and \naccountability, the ecosystem hub can help build\
    \ trust among stakeholders and encourage \ngreater participation in data sharing\
    \ efforts. \nAgricultural data governance framework based on data rights could\
    \ indeed provide a \nlegal framework that protects data originators' rights and\
    \ promotes trust in data sharing. \nThis can increase the amount of data made\
    \ available for re-use and encourage data altruism \nacross the agriculture sector\
    \ in the U.S. A robust data governance framework can also \nfoster institutional\
    \ intermediation services, promoting sustainable data-based economic \ntransactions\
    \ benefiting the agriculture sector.  \nIn general, the goal of this approach\
    \ is to ensure that all stakeholders in the agricultural \nsector are protected\
    \ by a robust data governance framework that promotes transparency, \naccountability,\
    \ and trust in the data sharing process. \nSafeguards for data security for agricultural\
    \ data as non-personal data and data \noriginators' data rights protection \n\
    \ \n63 Ecosystem Hub is defined as a network of institutions or organizations\
    \ providing services, and more \nimportantly, maintaining overall connectivity\
    \ as hubs to improve elder care services. \n \n121 \nTo ensure data security and\
    \ protect data originators' data rights in the agriculture sector, \nthe following\
    \ safeguards can be put in place: \n- \nData anonymization and aggregation: non-personal\
    \ data in agriculture can be \nmade anonymous by aggregating data into statistical\
    \ models. This ensures that \ndata is not associated with any individual, and\
    \ thus, privacy is protected. \n- \nData access controls: Access to sensitive\
    \ data should be restricted to only \nauthorized individuals, organizations, and\
    \ data intermediaries. This can be done \nthrough password protection, data encryption,\
    \ or other access control \nmechanisms. \n- \nRegular security audits: Regular\
    \ security audits can be conducted to ensure that \ndata is secure and that data\
    \ originators' data rights are being protected. This can \nhelp identify any potential\
    \ vulnerabilities or breaches in the data system and allow \nfor prompt action\
    \ to be taken to address them. \nThe regulatory environment should strike a balance\
    \ between protecting data originators' \nrights and incentivizing innovation and\
    \ data sharing in the agriculture sector. By providing \nnecessary protections\
    \ for data security and privacy, and establishing backup and recovery \nsystems,\
    \ farmers and primary producers can feel more confident in participating in data\
    \ \nsharing and economic activities without fear of exploitation. \nEnablers to\
    \ increase data integration, interoperability, and operations to access \ninformation\
    \ and to create incentives by removing barriers to voluntary data sharing \nand\
    \ facilitate a smart digital agriculture in the U.S. \n \n122 \nEnabling data\
    \ integration, interoperability, and operations, and creating incentives \nrequires\
    \ the removal of barriers to voluntary data sharing and the facilitation of a\
    \ smart \ndigital agriculture ecosystem in the U.S. This can be achieved by investing\
    \ in modern \ninfrastructure, promoting the adoption of common data standards\
    \ and protocols, fostering \nthe development of data intermediaries and data cooperatives,\
    \ and promoting transparency \nand trust in data sharing among stakeholders. In\
    \ addition, creating incentives, such as \nproviding tax credits or funding opportunities,\
    \ can encourage voluntary data sharing and \nthe adoption of digital technologies,\
    \ which can lead to more efficient and sustainable \nagriculture practices. \n\
    Rights to/on Data as a force for public good \nData is a non-rivalrous good, meaning\
    \ its use by one party does not diminish its use by \nanother. To ensure fair\
    \ use of agricultural data, organizations holding the ADT logo \naccreditation\
    \ and following the U.S. COP \"core principles\" should inform farmers and \n\
    primary producers about the rights they assert in relation to the data, as well\
    \ as the rights \nthe producers have regarding the data. It is also essential\
    \ to disclose the terms under which \nagricultural data is made available to authorized\
    \ third parties or those acting on behalf of \nthe primary producers. \nThe concept\
    \ of data rights as a force for public good refers to the idea that data, \nespecially\
    \ agricultural data, should be viewed as a valuable resource that can benefit\
    \ \nsociety as a whole. This means that data originators (i.e., farmers and primary\
    \ producers) \nshould have the right to control how their data is collected, used,\
    \ and shared, and that the \npublic should have access to certain categories of\
    \ data that can be used to improve \nagricultural practices, support research,\
    \ and inform public policy. By recognizing data as a \n \n123 \npublic good, institutions\
    \ and agencies in the agriculture sector can create a regulatory \nenvironment\
    \ that encourages data sharing and innovation while also protecting data privacy\
    \ \nand security. Ultimately, this approach can help to promote sustainable agriculture\
    \ and \neconomic growth while ensuring that data is used for the greater good\
    \ of society. \nCreating a data governance framework entail putting regulations,\
    \ procedures, and norms \nin place at the macro institutional level. According\
    \ to Séronie, encouraging adherence to \nestablished rules, processes, and standards\
    \ for data usage can result in increased efficiency, \nbetter technical performance,\
    \ lower costs, and lower environmental impact at the macro \nlevel (2020, p.4).\
    \ Furthermore, it can pave the way for a cultural shift toward understanding \n\
    how to manage and govern data. Table 16 compares the three policy options proposed\
    \ for \naddressing the agricultural data policy challenge in the United States.\

    \ to \nfacilitate and ensure data use and reuse. Therefore, in light of the agricultural\
    \ data \ngovernance policy problem, it is necessary to control data access and\
    \ sharing by defining \nthe roles and responsibilities of agencies and institutions.\
    \ These are additional components \nincluded in this research's data governance\
    \ framework. Additionally, institutions in the \n \n125 \nagriculture sector should\
    \ specify and define the types of data, such as public and private \nintent agricultural\
    \ data, that can be shared, used, and reused. \n \n \n126 \nChapter 4: Policy\
    \ Proposal \nThe objective of this chapter is to use methods of policy forecasting\
    \ to generate a policy \nproposal from the three options presented in Chapter\
    \ 3. These methods will be used to \ndetermine which of the three policy models,\
    \ either individually or in combination, is most \nlikely to advance the goals\
    \ of agricultural data governance, and whether any of them should \nbe rejected\
    \ based on their predicted effects. The results will be used in the Conclusion\
    \ to \nsuggest next steps and further research needs. \nForecasting in policy\
    \ analysis refers to a “set of procedures for creating information \nabout future\
    \ states of society based on present or prior information” (Dunn, 2018, p. 119)\
    \ \nrelated to a particular policy issue or problem. The goal is to generate information\
    \ about \nfuture societal states regarding a specific policy issue based on present\
    \ information. Table \n17 presents a description of the forecasting methods that\

    \ \nAdapted from Dunn, 2018 \nThis research uses projection, prediction, and expert\
    \ judgment (or conjecture) as \nforecasting methods to estimate the potential\
    \ outcomes of the three policy options for \nagricultural data governance. These\
    \ methods aim to provide insight into the expected or \nestimated policy outcomes\
    \ of a framework for agricultural data governance. \nAs stated in the beginning\
    \ of this project, the policy output of agricultural data \ngovernance is the\
    \ production and sharing of high-quality data, and the resulting outcome \nis\
    \ a cost-effective digitization of the agricultural sector. The ultimate objective\
    \ is to \nestablish a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable\
    \ agricultural sector. As \n \n128 \nthis research assumes a direct connection\
    \ from outputs to outcome to impact, the policy \nforecasting here is limited\
    \ to outputs. \nIn the case of the agricultural data problem in the U.S., forecasting\
    \ policy options can \nlead to the development of an agricultural data governance\
    \ framework that meets the \nexpectations of all stakeholders while improving\
    \ efficiency and sustainability in \nagriculture. By forecasting the contents\
    \ of the three new policy options, this research aims \nto determine the most\
    \ plausible option for the future of the agriculture sector in the U.S. \nFigure\
    \ 21 illustrates the structure of the forecasting process. \nFigure 21 Forecasting\
    \ process structure \n \nProjection \nDue to the lack of a comprehensive national\
    \ inventory of data governance regulatory \npractices in the U.S., early projections\
    \ of the three policy options proposed in this study \nare challenging. However,\
    \ the current and rapid development of what scholars refer to as \n \n129 \nthe\
    \ \"data economy\" (Chen, 2021, p. 29) justifies the need for flexible policies\
    \ that can \nfacilitate the growth of various data-driven products, services,\
    \ and business models. \nCOPs represent an initial sector-specific effort to address\
    \ emerging concerns \nsurrounding agricultural data practices. In the U.S., the\
    \ COPs, also known as \"core \nprinciples,\" have been adopted by large farmer-led\
    \ organizations and associations such as \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation\
    \ (AFBF). However, only 37 agriculture tech \nproviders64 have undergone the certification\
    \ process of the Ag Data Transparent Evaluator \n(ADT) and agreed to incorporate\
    \ the \"core principles\" into their contracts and agreements \nwith farmers (Janzen,\
    \ 202165). \nThis COP or \"core principles\" in the U.S. represent a mid-stream,\
    \ non-binding form of \nagricultural data regulation due to the voluntary commitment\
    \ of agriculture tech providers \nto data transparency with farmers and the lack\
    \ of an assessment or evaluation process for \ntheir compliance.  \nA minimal\
    \ policy option for agricultural data governance provides the minimal enablers\
    \ \nfor data sharing, compelling agriculture tech providers to adhere to the \"\
    core principles\" \nwhen collecting, storing, and transferring farmers' agricultural\
    \ data. In this minimalist \npolicy option, state agriculture public entities\
    \ such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nhave a minimal role contribution.\
    \ This agency serves as an enabler in verifying compliance \nwith the \"core principles\"\
    \ and auditing companies with the ADT seal and their agricultural \ndata contracts\
    \ and agreements. \n \n64 Figure 6 depicts more than 100 technology firms that\
    \ are digitally transforming farming practices. \n65 Information available at:\
    \ https://www.agdatatransparent.com/about \n \n130 \nMany U.S. companies that\
    \ collect agricultural data have yet to commit to the \nagricultural data \"core\
    \ principles\" (Janzen, 202166). However, adopting a minimal policy \noption based\
    \ on the existing COP could be rapidly embraced and effectively implemented, \n\
    given the established principles and certification process recognized by large\
    \ farmer-led \nassociations. With clear role definitions and public institution\
    \ support, the number of \ncompanies participating and signing on to the \"core\
    \ principles\" and achieving Ag Data \nTransparent certification could significantly\
    \ increase in the short term. \nMoving forward, a moderate data governance policy\
    \ option could include not only \nintroducing safeguards for agricultural data\
    \ sharing but also enabling the flow and reuse of \nnon-personal public administrative\
    \ agricultural data. While this represents a new policy \ncontext and content,\
    \ forecasting its success is difficult. \nA maximalist data governance policy\
    \ would include both safeguards and enablers, \nprotecting data rights and facilitating\
    \ the use and re-use of public administrative \nagricultural data while ensuring\
    \ its safe flow among stakeholders. This policy would \npromote a trustworthy\
    \ agricultural data system by increasing awareness of the value of \nagricultural\
    \ data and encouraging participation in the ag sector data economy. However, \n\
    like the moderate policy alternative, projecting the effectiveness of this policy\
    \ prediction \nis challenging. \nThese three policy options are currently conceptual\
    \ and projecting their effectiveness is \ndifficult and insufficient. However,\
    \ based on a comparative macro analysis of the literature \nand the Global Data\
    \ Regulation diagnostic, which assesses data governance laws and \n \n66 Information\
    \ available at: https://www.agdatatransparent.com/about \n \n131 \nregulations\
    \ across 80 countries, it is accurate to project that a normative legal framework\
    \ \nfor agricultural data governance would be an important addition to the future\
    \ of the \nagricultural data economy in the U.S. \nPrediction \nForeseeing the\
    \ future impact of a data governance policy framework for the agriculture \nsector\
    \ in the United States involves considering the potential positive and negative\
    \ \nfeedback loops. These will be evaluated by institutions and stakeholders who\
    \ are subject \nto the enforcement of these regulations and norms. The predictive\
    \ approach relies on a set \nof causal assumptions about how a particular policy\
    \ may be implemented and what its \noutcomes will be. As a result, forecasting\
    \ the three policy options involves predicting not \nonly their feasibility but\
    \ also their impact on the agriculture sector. \nTo theorize and predict the feasibility\
    \ of the three agricultural data governance policy \noptions, this research section\
    \ draws on the notion of a collective action problem. This \napproach presents\
    \ a theoretical perspective that compares existing literature on collective \n\
    action to explain data governance as a current issue within the data economy.\
    \ The aim is \nto attempt a prediction that explains the reasons for adopting\
    \ a minimalist, moderate, or \nmaximalist policy alternative. \nThe Coleman Boat\
    \ model provides a predictive framework that outlines how certain \nfactors can\
    \ lead to specific outcomes through various mechanisms. In the context of \nagricultural\
    \ data governance, the Coleman Boat model represents the relationship between\
    \ \nthe macro and micro aspects of the social system. At the macro level, agricultural\
    \ data \ngovernance is institutionalized as a policy framework that sets the norms\
    \ for sector \n \n132 \nparticipation. The meso level is crucial in determining\
    \ whether individuals participate in \nand share data within the framework, as\
    \ their decisions are influenced by factors such as \ntrust, transparency, and\
    \ legitimacy. \nIntegrating Benfeldt et al.'s (2020) collective action theory\
    \ approach to data governance \ninto the model can offer a more comprehensive\
    \ insight into the meso and micro processes \nthat influence participation in\
    \ Ag-DG. This perspective highlights the challenges of \nmobilizing an organization\
    \ to adopt a data governance framework. It emphasizes the \nimportance of understanding\
    \ the internal dynamics of the system or organization, which \nincludes comprehending\
    \ the motivations and behaviors of individual actors. \nBenfeldt et al.'s (2020)\
    \ approach identifies six constituent challenges that must be \naddressed to successfully\
    \ adopt data governance within public organizations, including \nperceiving value,\
    \ enabling collaboration, fostering capabilities, data overview, local \npractices,\
    \ and political ambience (Benfeldt et al., 2020, 308). These challenges are \n\
    interrelated and form a \"problem triangle,\" as illustrated in Figure 22, which\
    \ is adapted to \nthe agricultural data governance policy problem. \n \n133 \n\
    Figure 22 Data Governance Collective Action Problem in Public Organizations \n\
    \ \nThe problem triangle describes the difficulties faced by actors with diverse\
    \ and possibly \nconflicting interests, who struggle to find common ground and\
    \ collaborate towards a shared \nobjective. By integrating Benfeldt's ideas into\
    \ the Coleman Boat model, we can gain a \nbetter understanding of how these challenges\
    \ affect individual and organizational \nparticipation in agricultural data governance.\
    \ \nAt the micro level, the challenge of recognizing the value of sharing data\
    \ may influence \nthe decisions of individual stakeholders to participate in Ag-DG.\
    \ Additionally, the \nchallenge of enabling collaboration may impact the effectiveness\
    \ of the framework as a \nwhole, as it influences how well stakeholders work together.\
    \ \nTo overcome these challenges, it is necessary to foster capabilities, provide\
    \ an overview \nof the available data, align local practices, and create a conducive\
    \ political environment. \nThis integrated framework provides a more comprehensive\
    \ explanation of the mechanisms \nthat lead to successful agricultural data governance.\
    \ \n \n134 \nBenfeldt et al. (2020, p.309) explain: \nPerceiving value of data\
    \ governance is challenging because actors in a \ncollective tend to ascribe different\
    \ meanings to the purpose or outcome \nof the collective action. Enabling collaboration\
    \ between functions on \ndata governance is complicated because actors tend to\
    \ take actions that \nprotect their individual interests at the expense of achieving\
    \ a greater \njoint outcome. Fostering capabilities for governing data is difficult\
    \ \nbecause doing so requires effectively managing heterogeneous resources \n\
    contributed by different actors to the common \"good\" produced in a \ncollective.\
    \ (Benfeldt et al., 2020, p. 309) \nAdopting a data governance framework is assumed\
    \ to be beneficial because it involves \nimplementing processes and principles\
    \ that are supposed to be enterprise-wide.” (Benfeldt \net al., 2020, p. 306).\
    \ Therefore, from a collective action theoretical perspective, agricultural \n\
    data has the potential to become a collective good based on the willingness and\
    \ capabilities \nof users to take advantage of it. \nIn addition, within the context\
    \ of the digital data economy, Kerber & Frank (2017) \npropose a framework that\
    \ identifies the main causes of potential market failure problems \nin data trading\
    \ within the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These market failure \nproblems\
    \ include information asymmetries about data quality and source, a lack of demand\
    \ \nfor data due to a lack of awareness of its value, a lack of interoperability\
    \ and \nstandardization, pricing problems, and strategic reasons for data holders\
    \ not to share, trade, \nor give access to data. \nIn the current agricultural\
    \ data landscape, private companies have demonstrated the \nvalue of collecting\
    \ and utilizing agricultural data. However, the U.S. Department of \n \n135 \n\
    Agriculture (USDA) has lagged behind in terms of data collection, integration,\
    \ and \nutilization. For instance, the USDA collects vast amounts of data to support\
    \ a diverse range \nof agricultural programs. Nevertheless, the lack of clear\
    \ collaboration across agencies has \nhindered data utilization. As a result,\
    \ there are numerous disconnected data silos within the \nUSDA that, at times,\
    \ require employees to make manual data calls to gather essential \ninformation\
    \ for analysis (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 5). Consequently, data-driven decision-\n\
    making practices are challenging to implement. \nExpert judgment or Conjecture\
    \ \nThe conjecture approach relies on expert judgments, which are valuable because\
    \ they \nconcentrate on predictions of future trends and implicit knowledge of\
    \ the probable \ntriumphs or failures of various policy options, instead of past\
    \ data or formal models. One \ncritical aspect of this approach is making conjectures\
    \ about the future state of technology \nand data. Moreover, it is important to\
    \ note that expert judgment or conjecture can be a \nvaluable tool in policy analysis\
    \ and the development of agricultural data governance \npolicies. While past data\
    \ and formal models are useful, expert judgment can provide \ninsights into future\
    \ trends and the potential success or failure of policy options. However, \nit\
    \ is essential to ensure that expert judgments are based on sound reasoning and\
    \ evidence, \nrather than personal bias or unsupported assumptions. \nFor instance,\
    \ the \"Data for Better Lives\" World Bank report argues that to use data for\
    \ \ndevelopment purposes, a legal framework for data governance is necessary,\
    \ which should \ninclude both safeguards and enablers (World Bank, 2021, p. 190).\
    \ Safeguards are legal \nframeworks and norms that ensure trust in data governance\
    \ and management by limiting \n \n136 \nharm from data misuse and breaches affecting\
    \ data security and integrity. Enablers refer to \npolicies, laws, regulations,\
    \ and standards that enable the use, reuse, and sharing of data \nwithin and between\
    \ stakeholder groups by promoting openness, interoperability, and \nportability.\
    \ \nIn Industry Revolution 4.0, a data governance framework approach is necessary\
    \ to \ntransform data into a strategic asset for organizations and sectors. In\
    \ the agriculture sector, \nscholars such as Jouanjean et al. (2020) and Wiseman\
    \ et al. (2019) agree that starting with \nsector-specific solutions is key to\
    \ solving data governance problems. \nFor example, Wiseman et al. (2019) examined\
    \ three of the four existing codes of \nconduct (COPs) on agricultural data, except\
    \ for the most recent one from Australia, and \nmade recommendations. The authors\
    \ suggested a farmer-centered COP on agricultural data \nas it would facilitate\
    \ broad adoption and have a greater impact. However, it is crucial to \nensure\
    \ the legitimacy of the code and those who administer and accredit compliance.\
    \ \nAdopting minimal normative regulation where farmers’ associations and agriculture\
    \ public \norganizations play a role could ensure proper implementation and enforcement\
    \ of an \nagricultural data governance policy. \nSanderson and Wiseman (2018)\
    \ stress the importance of developing a tailored data \ngovernance framework specific\
    \ to the agriculture sector, due to the distinct categories of \nagricultural\
    \ data. The use of voluntary-private membership contractual models, such as \n\
    COPs, is recommended by Wiseman et al. (2019) to ensure data sharing and gain\
    \ farmers' \ntrust. However, since COPs are governed through private data contractual\
    \ agreements, they \nmay be more suitable for agribusinesses and companies working\
    \ with farmers and using \n \n137 \ntheir data, rather than farmers-led organizations/associations.\
    \ Nevertheless, to ensure \nproper implementation and enforcement of COPs and\
    \ the credibility of farmers in their \nself-regulation, scholars argue that governments\
    \ must also play a role in agricultural data \nmanagement and practice (Wiseman\
    \ et al. 2019, p.13). This highlights the need for \nnormative regulation for\
    \ agricultural data governance that represents smallholder farmers, \nnot just\
    \ through associations but also directly. \nThe rapidly evolving IoT technology\
    \ requires regulatory efforts to be open to new \ninnovations in order to solve\
    \ data governance problems. Therefore, a legal framework for \ndata governance,\
    \ whether minimalist, moderate, or maximalist, should limit private parties' \n\
    freedom to produce, create, and use data in new ways only as necessary to address\
    \ market \nfailure problems, such as lack of rights on data, competition problems,\
    \ information \nproblems, and transaction cost problems (Kerber & Frank, 2017,\
    \ p. 17) and achieve other \nnormative societal objectives. \nA Two-Stage Model\
    \ for Agricultural Data Governance Policy Framework \nThis section also includes\
    \ a two-step feasibility analysis. In the first step, each policy \noption is\
    \ analyzed based on the identified policy problem components to determine the\
    \ \nfactors that could define the effects or consequences of the chosen policy's\
    \ success or \nfailure. The second step attempts to predict which policy option\
    \ would be feasible from a \npolicy process selection perspective. This step addresses\
    \ major issues influencing the \npolicy process, including incidents, ideas, interests,\
    \ institutions, inter-unit diffusion, and \nindustrialization. These elements\
    \ are crucial in the policy history process and require \nanswering a set of minimum\
    \ questions as part of the feasibility analysis to identify any \n \n138 \noutstanding\
    \ issues or concerns with each policy alternative. Figure 23 illustrates the two-\n\
    step process used to analyze each policy option and predict which one could be\
    \ feasibly \nadvocated for not only in terms of solving the agricultural data\
    \ governance policy problem \nbut also in terms of feasibility for adoption. \

    option. By examining how well each policy option addresses these dimensions and\
    \ issues, \nwe can determine which option is most feasible to advocate for within\
    \ the policy process.  \nTable 20 Six dimensions for policy prescription analysis\

    \ dimension. These values were classified as \"high,\" \"medium,\" \"low,\" or\
    \ \n\"underserved.\" The \"high\" rating was calculated by summing the values\
    \ assigned to each \ndimension for each policy option. The specific values assigned\
    \ to each factor in each \ndimension for each policy option are detailed in the\
    \ annexes. Using the total sum of each \npolicy option for each dimension in the\

    \ \n145 \nof feasibility for implementing each policy option. The total sum was\
    \ a value of 10, \nrepresenting the sum of each dimension's possible value. \n\
    Tables 19 and 22 show that the Minimalist policy option receives high ratings\
    \ in the \nincidents and institutions dimensions but low ratings in the interests\
    \ and ideas, inter-unit \ndiffusion, and industrialization dimensions. The Minimalist\
    \ policy option appears to \nprioritize addressing the dimension of trust between\
    \ farmers and agricultural technology \nproviders in data sharing, with a high\
    \ level of feasibility in terms of incidents, institutions, \nand policy adoption\
    \ time and budget. However, it shows low feasibility in addressing the \ndimension\
    \ of data privacy and confidentiality norms and rights, and only moderate \nfeasibility\
    \ in the dimension of oversight, accountability, and transparency in data \nproduction\
    \ cycle. Concerning policy process feasibility, the Minimalist option has a \n\
    moderate percentage of policy feasibility, indicating that it may encounter some\
    \ challenges \nin terms of interest and ideas and inter-unit diffusion. \nBased\
    \ on the information provided in the two tables, it is important to note that\
    \ policy \noptions for agricultural data governance should be carefully considered\
    \ in terms of their \nfeasibility and ability to address the dimensions of the\
    \ problem. The Minimalist policy \noption may be effective in addressing the issue\
    \ of trust between farmers and agricultural \ntechnology providers in data sharing,\
    \ but may face challenges in terms of data privacy and \nconfidentiality norms\
    \ and rights, as well as oversight, accountability, and transparency in \nthe\
    \ data production cycle. It is also important to consider the level of policy\
    \ process \nfeasibility, which includes incidents, interests and ideas, institutions,\
    \ inter-unit diffusion, \nand industrialization. By carefully examining and selecting\
    \ the appropriate policy option, \n \n146 \npolicymakers can ensure that the agricultural\
    \ sector benefits from the use of data while also \nprotecting the rights and\
    \ interests of farmers and other stakeholders involved in the process. \nThe Moderate\
    \ policy option outperformed both the Minimalist and Maximalist options \nin both\
    \ dimensions. It achieved an 80% feasibility rate in the Policy Process Feasibility\
    \ \nDimension and an 83% problem response rate in the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem \ndimensions, making it the most viable option for addressing the issue.\
    \ \nThe Moderate option excelled in all four dimensions of the agricultural data\
    \ governance \nproblem, including trust between farmers and agricultural technology\
    \ providers in data \nsharing, data privacy and confidentiality norms and rights,\
    \ oversight, accountability, and \ntransparency in the data production cycle,\
    \ and digital transformation in the smart farming \nsector. It also received a\
    \ high score in the industrialization dimension of the Policy Process \nFeasibility\
    \ table, indicating that it is the most advantageous option for the sector's \n\
    advancement in the digital transformation era. \nThe Moderate policy option is\
    \ expected to have a significant impact on the agricultural \ndata governance\
    \ problem while remaining feasible for implementation. Therefore, it is the \n\
    most practical policy option for addressing the agricultural data governance problem.\
    \ \nDespite scoring high in all four dimensions of the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem, \nthe Moderate option may face obstacles in terms of adoption time\
    \ and budget, as rated as \nmedium in the Policy Options table. Furthermore, traditional\
    \ farmers may resist or pose \nbarriers to the option's implementation, despite\
    \ its high score in the industrialization \ndimension. It is therefore essential\
    \ to discuss these potential challenges to gain a more \n \n147 \ncomprehensive\
    \ understanding of the feasibility and potential impact of the Moderate policy\
    \ \noption. \nBased on the analysis so far, we can rule out the Maximalist option\
    \ because it received \nthe lowest score in all dimensions of the public policy\
    \ adoption process. The Maximalist \noption scored poorly in the effectiveness\
    \ dimension because it would likely face significant \nopposition from key stakeholders,\
    \ such as farmers, who may be unwilling to share their \ndata. In addition, the\
    \ Maximalist option's approach to data governance may not effectively \naddress\
    \ the problems associated with agricultural data governance. The Maximalist option\
    \ \nalso received a low score in the feasibility dimension because it would be\
    \ difficult to \nimplement given the current resource and capacity constraints.\
    \ It would require significant \nfunding and coordination between various institutions\
    \ and stakeholders, which may not be \nfeasible in the short term. Furthermore,\
    \ the Maximalist option may not be sustainable over \nthe long term as it may\
    \ face challenges in maintaining political and stakeholder support. \nTherefore,\
    \ based on the evidence gathered, it is unlikely that the Maximalist option would\
    \ \nbe the optimal policy for governing agricultural data. \nIn this research,\
    \ the policy problem of agricultural data governance has been analyzed, \nand\
    \ four main dimensions have been identified: data sharing, the data production\
    \ cycle, \ndata rights and norms, and smart farming. Based on these dimensions,\
    \ three policy options \nhave been developed to propose a policy framework that\
    \ addresses each dimension of the \nagricultural data policy problem. The proposed\
    \ policy options range from minimal to \nmaximalist government approaches, with\
    \ each option providing data safeguards, enablers, \nroles, and responsibilities\
    \ for governing agricultural data. After forecasting the outcomes \nof these three\
    \ policy options, it has been concluded that the minimalist and moderate \n \n\
    148 \napproaches are the most feasible options within the policy process, as they\
    \ not only solve \nthe agricultural data governance problem but also account for\
    \ new innovations and \ntechnological developments. In contrast, the maximalist\
    \ option fails to provide a realistic \nand feasible policy solution. Therefore,\
    \ the proposed two-stage model for agricultural data \ngovernance policy recommends\
    \ the adoption of the minimalist or moderate approach, \ndepending on the specific\
    \ needs and characteristics of each agricultural sector in the US. \n▪ \nPrescription:\
    \ The Final Step in Agricultural Data Governance \nPolicy Analysis  \nThe final\
    \ step in the policy analysis process is to propose a policy option that is most\
    \ \nlikely to resolve the governance issues of agricultural data in the United\
    \ States. This step \nis called prescription, and it focuses on policy choice\
    \ by considering the reasons for \nselecting a particular option. In other words,\
    \ it provides a means of selecting one policy \noption from among several possible\
    \ outcomes (Dunn, 2018, p. 190). In the remainder of \nthis chapter, this research\
    \ will examine which of the two feasible policy options, minimalist \nor moderate,\
    \ should be recommended based on the outcomes previously determined in the \n\
    agriculture sector. \nConsidering the trade-offs associated with collective action,\
    \ both the minimalist and \nmoderate policy alternatives are likely to achieve\
    \ the policy goal67 of balancing equity and \n \n67 Policy goal: “A desired outcome\
    \ of a policy; these goals can be explicitly stated or implicit in the \npolicy\
    \ and other factors found in its legislative history” (Birkland, 2016, p. 236)\
    \ \n \n149 \nefficiency68 among the proposed agricultural data governance policy\
    \ options. These policy \nalternatives aim to address the lack of data standardization,\
    \ access, sharing, and use, not \nonly to enhance agricultural practices and productivity,\
    \ but also to improve crop yields, \nnutritional quality, and promote sustainable\
    \ agriculture overall. \nThe minimalist policy option aims to implement and practice\
    \ data governance principles \nbased on the United States COP Core Principles\
    \ effectively. Its purpose is to monitor \ncompliance with the Core Principles\
    \ in contractual agreements to enable a trusted data-\nsharing system across the\
    \ U.S. agriculture sector. On the other hand, the moderate policy \nalternative\
    \ for agricultural data governance not only aims to implement and practice data\
    \ \ngovernance Core Principles but also assigns roles and responsibilities for\
    \ data access and \nsharing. It also emphasizes the use of data value and promotes\
    \ sector collaboration. \nHowever, achieving a well-balanced solution between\
    \ the interests of various \nstakeholders can be a complex task. Therefore, proposing\
    \ a specific policy option requires \nan evaluation to determine the best approach.\
    \ In governing agricultural data, the aim is to \nmaximize the benefits of sharing\
    \ and using such data in relation to the costs of not currently \nutilizing large\
    \ amounts of unshared agricultural data due to stakeholders' distrust. \nSharing\
    \ and using agricultural data can significantly improve agricultural productivity\
    \ \nand risk management, including adaptation or mitigation of the effects of\
    \ climate change \n(OECD, 2019). Data-driven decisions could also enhance international\
    \ market access and \nopen up new digital trade opportunities, which would benefit\
    \ agricultural productivity, \n \n68 Efficiency: “Gaining the most output for\
    \ a given level of input… [it] is often thought of as getting the \nsame output\
    \ for less of a particular input, or getting more of something for a constant\
    \ input.” (Birkland, \n2016, p. 233). \n \n150 \nprofitability, food security,\
    \ and the overall digitalization of the agricultural sector, leading \nto data-ization.\
    \ \nTo summarize, proposing a policy option for governing agricultural data in\
    \ the United \nStates necessitates careful consideration of the trade-offs associated\
    \ with collective action, \nas well as an in-depth assessment of the costs and\
    \ benefits of the available policy \nalternatives. Prescription, the final step\
    \ in the policy analysis process, focuses on selecting \nthe best policy option\
    \ based on its potential outcomes.  \nIn this case, the minimalist and moderate\
    \ policy alternatives are the most feasible \nalternatives for achieving the policy\
    \ goal of balancing equity and efficiency in agricultural \ndata governance. The\
    \ minimalist policy option seeks to monitor compliance with COP \nprinciples,\
    \ whereas the moderate policy option assigns roles and responsibilities for data\
    \ \naccess and sharing while emphasizing data value and encouraging sector collaboration.\
    \ \nCost-effective analysis and costs and benefits analysis will be used to determine\
    \ the best \napproach for governing agricultural data and maximizing the benefits\
    \ of sharing and using \nsuch data in relation to the costs for the agriculture\
    \ sector in the U.S. \nCost Effective Analysis  \nCost-effectiveness analysis\
    \ (CEA) is a useful method that enables a comparison of \npolicy options not only\
    \ based on their effectiveness (benefits) measured in units of public \ngoods\
    \ or services but also on the costs associated with achieving different levels\
    \ of benefits \nthat may be more effective at a lower cost (Dunn, 2018, p. 217).\
    \ Therefore, the CEA \nmethod can be employed to examine and compare the benefits\
    \ that the minimalist policy \noption for agricultural data governance offers\
    \ in comparison to the moderate policy option \n \n151 \nand the status quo, which\
    \ is doing nothing at all. Through this evaluation process, it will \nbe possible\
    \ to determine the most cost-effective and beneficial policy option for the \n\
    agricultural sector. \nThree criteria are commonly used in CEA. The first is the\
    \ adequacy analysis, which \nexamines whether a policy option can meet minimal\
    \ standards of benefit at some maximal \ncost level. The second criterion, cost\
    \ minimization, evaluates whether a policy option has \nthe lowest costs for some\
    \ minimally acceptable level of benefits. Finally, the third criterion, \nbenefit\
    \ maximization, assesses whether a policy option provides the greatest benefits\
    \ for \nsome maximally acceptable level of costs. Applying these criteria will\
    \ enable us to identify \nthe most cost-effective policy option for governing\
    \ agricultural data in the U.S. \nThe cost effectiveness of agricultural data\
    \ governance policy framework will depend on \nseveral factors: \n- \nThe volume\
    \ and complexity of the data: The more data that needs to be collected, \nstored,\
    \ and managed, the more costly it may be to implement effective \ngovernance policy.\
    \ \n- \nThe level of risk associated with the data: If the data is sensitive or\
    \ valuable, more \nstringent security measures may be required, which may increase\
    \ the cost. \n- \nThe level of collaboration required: If multiple stakeholders\
    \ are involved in the \ndata collection and use, it may be more costly to coordinate\
    \ their efforts and \nensure that everyone is following the same data governance\
    \ guidelines and \nstandards. \n \n152 \n- \nThe availability of funding: The\
    \ availability of funding can play a significant role \nin the cost effectiveness\
    \ of agricultural data governance policy framework. If \nsufficient resources\
    \ are available, more robust governance measures may be \nimplemented. \nAn effective\
    \ agricultural data governance policy should ultimately balance the costs of \n\
    implementing governance measures with the benefits of ensuring that data is collected,\
    \ \nstored, and used in a way that benefits all stakeholders. This balance is\
    \ crucial to ensure \nthat the policy is sustainable and provides value to the\
    \ agricultural sector. \nThe comparison between the two policy options (minimalist\
    \ and moderate) showed that \nwhile policy option II (moderate) may achieve higher\
    \ overall benefit maximization by \nallocating more funds, policy option I (minimalist)\
    \ achieves the minimum standard of \nbenefits of data governance at the lowest\
    \ cost, making it the most effective choice. The \nCEA method did not identify\
    \ any potential problems or unintended consequences of either \npolicy implementation.\
    \ Implementing a design and strategy to improve data governance \nand its consumption\
    \ is a challenging task. Therefore, Policy Option I will be pursued as it \nwill\
    \ serve as the foundation for Policy Option II. This approach provides a significant\
    \ \nbenefit and is the most efficient way to implement an agricultural data governance\
    \ policy \nsolution. Table 23 presents a comparison of the results of the cost-effectiveness\
    \ analysis. \n \n153 \nTable 23 Cost Effectiveness Analysis \nPolicy \nBenefit\

    \ and Benefits  \nIn this section, the forecasted effects of the minimal and moderate\
    \ policies are compared \nto a \"status quo\" situation, which represents the\
    \ measures or values of benefits and costs if \nthe policy vacuum scenario for\
    \ agricultural data governance persists. Maintaining the status \nquo of agricultural\
    \ data practices is also considered as one of the possible options. \nTo begin\
    \ this process of evaluating policy options for agricultural data governance,\
    \ it is \nnecessary to identify and categorize the costs and benefits associated\
    \ with each option. This \nanalysis should consider both direct and indirect costs\
    \ and benefits that are relevant to the \npolicy options being considered. Additionally,\
    \ the importance of each factor should be \nranked to help determine the relative\
    \ weight of each element in selecting among the \noptions. \nTo clarify, estimated\
    \ direct benefits are primary outcomes of a policy option that directly \naddress\
    \ the structured policy problem dimensions for the targeted population. On the\
    \ other \nhand, estimated indirect benefits are secondary outcomes that are associated\
    \ with less \nvalued benefits than the flow (access, sharing, and using) of agricultural\
    \ data governance, \nbut still contribute to solving the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem on a smaller scale. \n \n154 \nDirect estimated benefits refer to the\
    \ benefits that can be directly attributed to the \nimplementation of a policy\
    \ option. In the case of agricultural data governance, these \nbenefits would\
    \ focus on improving access, sharing, and the use of agricultural data. \nExamples\
    \ of these benefits could include the development of data-sharing standards, \n\
    incentivizing farmers, producers to share data, and building a data-sharing infrastructure\
    \ \nwithin agricultural research. The literature review was an effective source\
    \ for projecting \nthese direct estimated benefits. \nPotential indirect benefits\
    \ of facilitating data-sharing standards, safeguards, and \nenablers in agriculture\
    \ include increased collaboration between domain researchers and \ndata scientists,\
    \ as well as the development of a data-sharing infrastructure within \nagricultural\
    \ research. This can lead to increased research investment, and the recovery of\
    \ \nunpublished data, which can further support innovation and knowledge creation\
    \ in the \nfield. These indirect benefits may not be immediately apparent, but\
    \ can have a significant \nimpact on the overall success of agricultural research\
    \ and development efforts (Brouder et \nal., 2019, p. 2). \nTable 24 Estimated\

    \ in order to make it easier for \nprimary producers, practitioners, and \nresearchers\
    \ to find agricultural data in \ntheir field of interest (collaborative \nagricultural\
    \ open databases). \n \nThe digital economy has emerged alongside the flow of\
    \ data, creating the potential for \nsignificant innovation and benefits for users\
    \ (Howell, 2022, p.1). Data has two distinct \ncharacteristics that set it apart\
    \ from other goods: it is non-competing and displays network \neffects. This means\
    \ that a single piece of data has the capacity to provide multiple benefits \n\
    to multiple applications, and when combined with additional information, its value\
    \ \nincreases. To fully realize the potential of data, reliable data-sharing solutions\
    \ must be \ndeveloped, and this is where data governance comes into play. By ensuring\
    \ proper data \ngovernance, we can unlock the benefits of data while mitigating\
    \ risks and promoting ethical \npractices. \n \n157 \nThese potential benefits\
    \ can be observed in the wine industry, where having a \ntrustworthy system for\
    \ contractual agreements in place to access, share, and use data can \nplay a\
    \ significant role in sustaining a vibrant transatlantic trade relationship between\
    \ the \nEU and US wine sectors. This sector is a vital driving force in many rural\
    \ economies and \na significant number of medium and small businesses. Implementing\
    \ a data governance \nframework will incentivize government agencies to intervene\
    \ by collecting, linking, and \nanalyzing data to support the economic vitality\
    \ and diversity of the wine sectors. For \ninstance, this can involve working\
    \ on tariffs on wine to achieve a 'zero for zero' wine trade \nenvironment (Featherstone,\
    \ 2021). However, the US wine industry has recently faced \nchallenges due to\
    \ President Donald J. Trump's administration's imposition of a 25% tariff \non\
    \ French, Spanish, German, and English wines in October 2019, which led to a drop\
    \ of \nnearly $500 million in the value of French wine exports to the US in 202069.\
    \ \nDirect estimated benefits are essential in evaluating the significance of\
    \ collaborating \nwith provider users who have access to data and information\
    \ on pests and diseases to \ndevelop research on a single platform. An example\
    \ to consider is the PlantwisePlus \nKnowledge Bank70 and the CABI Digital Library\

    \ tools, among other \nadvantages. \nAnother example of how data governance solutions\
    \ can incentivize partnerships \nbetween public agencies and private companies\
    \ is the Agmatix initiative72. Agmatix is a \nstartup ag-tech company that has\
    \ developed a single engine to digitize research data, \nenabling agro-professionals\
    \ to increase crop yields and quality while minimizing \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ By employing machine learning and artificial intelligence, Agmatix \ncreates\
    \ statistically and scientifically stronger models and decision support systems,\
    \ which \ncan aid in the mainstream adoption of big data in agronomy to increase\
    \ global yields. The \nAgmatix platform facilitates the development of statistical\
    \ agricultural models, which can \nhelp reduce food waste and support global food\
    \ security in light of population growth. \nAgriculture science can be better\
    \ translated into practice through the implementation of \na data governance framework\
    \ for the sector. Such a framework can help provide policy \nmakers with access\
    \ to less fragmented, partial, and biased evidence, allowing for more \ninformed\
    \ decision-making. Additionally, according to PwC, IoT-enabled Agricultural \n\
    (IoTAg) monitoring is the fastest-growing technology segment in smart, connected\
    \ \nagriculture, with an expected market value of $4.5 billion by 2025 (Columbus,\
    \ 2021). \nThe estimated benefits highlighted above illustrate the value of implementing\
    \ an \nagricultural data governance policy. Establishing data safeguards and enablers\
    \ through \npolicy measures will facilitate the advancement of data sharing. Incorporating\

    \ to provide precise monetary \nestimates for each cost category in this research\

    \ \nfor the agriculture sector \n \n \nGlobally, it is expected that the amount\
    \ of data generated each day will reach 463 \nexabytes (Bonner, 2022), highlighting\
    \ the growing importance of developing sustainable \n \n161 \ndata management\
    \ processes. Some studies have attempted to quantify the cost of poor data \n\
    quality. For example, according to a 2016 report by IBM (Redman, 2016), poor-quality\
    \ \ndata73 costs businesses $3.1 trillion annually in the United States alone.\
    \ Sakpal (2021) \nestimated that poor data quality costs organizations an average\
    \ of $15 million per year. \nMoreover, a study by Experian in 2020 found that\
    \ inaccurate data cost businesses an \naverage of 12% of their annual revenue.\
    \ These numbers are only estimates and may not be \napplicable to all organizations,\
    \ but they give a general sense of the significant financial \nimpact of poor\
    \ data quality. In addition to revenue impacts, poor-quality data or a lack of\
    \ \ndata can lead to flawed decision-making and assessments over time (Bonner,\
    \ 2022). Access \nand shareability are crucial for data to be useful. \nEvaluating\
    \ risk costs is important when determining which policy option has a lower \n\
    risk of harm. However, estimating potential consequences and external factors\
    \ that may \naffect outcomes is challenging (Aven, 2014, p. 20). Probabilities\
    \ are conditional (if...then) \nand based on prior knowledge about the event,\
    \ such as scientific knowledge, data, \nassumptions, perceptions, and beliefs\
    \ (Aven, 2014, p.23). Therefore, probability-based risk \nassessment costs for\
    \ an agricultural data policy framework are primarily informed by \nprevious knowledge\
    \ of agricultural data issues. For instance, in the US agriculture sector, \n\
    data access and use by others continue to be dependent on individual contractual\
    \ \nagreements, aided by one-time trial-and-error data transfer solutions (Cragin\
    \ et al. 2010). \nA significant barrier remains the lack of funding for synthesis\
    \ research using aggregated \n \n73 Poor quality data can include inaccurate information,\
    \ incomplete data, non-formatted information, \nirrelevant content, or even duplicate\
    \ data. \n \n162 \ndata. Concerns about data privacy, security, and intellectual\
    \ property also prevent emerging \ndata-sharing efforts, particularly those involving\
    \ public-private partnerships. \nTo assess risk, it's important to measure or\
    \ calculate expected values or costs, which are \nknown as risk metrics. These\
    \ can provide valuable information about the level of risk in a \nspecific situation.\
    \ For example, in the United States, the infrastructure deficit poses a risk \n\
    to agriculture's ability to comply with \"open access\" policies. When assessing\
    \ risk at the \nmacro policy and governance levels, it's important to consider\
    \ not only the likelihood of a \nrisky event occurring and causing harm, but also\
    \ the unknown consequences and the \npotential human reactions, behaviors, and\
    \ attitudes towards it. \nThe public's expectations for accessing and using agricultural\
    \ science to make informed \ndecisions span a wide range of land management, from\
    \ understanding food's nutritional \nvalue for diet modification to vastly improving\
    \ precision technology application for \nprofitable crop and animal production\
    \ and environmental protection (Brouder et al., 2019, \np. 3). As such, risk is\
    \ a function of the implementation of public policy. It is important to \nevaluate\
    \ the likelihood of potential risks and their associated costs if policy option\
    \ one or \ntwo is implemented. \nUncertainties around funding could raise concerns\
    \ about the feasibility of functional, \nhybrid business data models that could\
    \ complement existing public financing data models \nthrough short-term research\
    \ grants or national funding (Brouder et al., 2019, p. 13). The \ncost of the\
    \ envisioned data infrastructure is largely unknown, but undoubtedly, significant\
    \ \ninvestment will be required. Data stewardship, as opposed to simple storage,\
    \ involves \n \n163 \nadditional workflows and human resources (Bourne, Lorsch,\
    \ and Green 2015), which \nfurther exacerbates cost concerns and uncertainty.\
    \ \nThe costs of modernizing agriculture data infrastructure (Ristino & Hart,\
    \ 2022) and \nrestructuring the USDA to oversee COP principles in contractual\
    \ agreements are estimated \nto be directly associated with the minimalist policy\
    \ option I. Modernizing the USDA will \nprovide a foundation for the moderate\
    \ policy option II, which aims to oversee agriculture \ndata intermediaries and\
    \ their processing, storage, analysis, and provision of other data \nservices\
    \ to farmers and producers. Estimated remaining costs in USDA modernization, \n\
    such as the formation of an agricultural data governance board for policy option\
    \ II to \npromote secure and safe agricultural data flow between data intermediaries,\
    \ farmers, and \nproducers, are lower. By modernizing USDA agencies, the agricultural\
    \ sector will witness \nincreased innovation, implementation of digital technologies\
    \ and tools, food security, \nsustainability, and a digitally transformed sector.\
    \ \nFindings \nThe analysis presented dismisses the status quo as an unrealistic\
    \ alternative, as it fails \nto provide any benefits while increasing costs and\
    \ risks associated with the loss of data \nliteracy and informed decision-making.\
    \ Policy option I is the best scenario, given the \ngovernment's allocation of\
    \ funds in the agricultural sector, as it offers the greatest benefit \nfor cost.\
    \ The cost and benefits analysis supports its implementation, as it will enhance\
    \ the \nstewardship and ownership of agricultural data, providing stakeholders\
    \ with a better \nunderstanding of the implications of ongoing technological innovations\
    \ in the sector. \nHowever, budget constraints may limit the scope of this option.\
    \ \n \n164 \nPolicy option II builds upon the foundation of policy option I and\
    \ can potentially provide \nadditional benefits. However, it may not necessarily\
    \ result in reduced costs compared to \npolicy option I. A more comprehensive\
    \ analysis that takes into account potential entry \nbarriers and the potential\
    \ for diminishing returns on investment may be necessary to fully \nunderstand\
    \ the economic impact of policy option II. Currently, both Cost-Effective \nAnalysis\
    \ and Costs and Benefits do not provide a clear picture of this impact. Policy\
    \ option \nI appears to be the most viable scenario in terms of costs and benefits.\
    \  \nThe CBA further supports this conclusion, as it confirms that maximizing\
    \ efficiency \nand minimizing costs will be critical to the successful implementation\
    \ of data governance \nin the agricultural sector. By adopting a comprehensive\
    \ approach to data stewardship and \nownership, farmers and producers can minimize\
    \ risks while maximizing outputs, all while \nmaintaining accurate records for\
    \ regulatory compliance. \nIn summary, the evidence suggests that policy option\
    \ I provides the best balance of \nbenefits and costs for the agricultural sector,\
    \ with policy option II serving as a logical \nextension of policy option I. By\
    \ adopting a forward-thinking approach to data governance \nand management, the\
    \ government can lay the groundwork for a sustainable and secure \nagricultural\
    \ future, while farmers and producers can enjoy the benefits of increased data\
    \ \nliteracy and informed decision-making. \n \n \n165 \nConclusion \nIn the era\
    \ of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, data is no longer just a byproduct of \n\
    agricultural activities; it has become a valuable commodity in its own right.\
    \ As the \nagriculture sector undergoes digital transformation, there is a growing\
    \ need for a \ncomprehensive data governance policy framework that can facilitate\
    \ the secure and \nefficient management of agricultural data.  \nThe analysis\
    \ of the agricultural data governance policy problem and the three policy \noptions\
    \ presented in this dissertation highlight the need for modernizing the agricultural\
    \ \ndata infrastructure in the U.S. agriculture sector. The core of this research\
    \ lies in identifying \na significant policy problem, specifically the lack of\
    \ a comprehensive agricultural data \ngovernance policy. Through this research,\
    \ the aim was to ask the appropriate questions to \naddress this issue from a\
    \ policy perspective, and propose potential solutions that can be \neffective\
    \ in facilitating the digital transformation of the agriculture sector.  \nThe\
    \ objective of an agricultural data governance policy framework is to promote\
    \ data \nsharing and reuse in the sector while protecting personal data and privacy.\
    \ A policy \nframework for cross-sector data sharing can establish clear rules,\
    \ such as obtaining consent \nand safeguarding personal data, promoting responsible\
    \ data sharing. This framework \nencourages innovation and competition while ensuring\
    \ that data is used for the greater good \nof agriculture in the U.S.  \nThis\
    \ research recommends implementing policy options to establish a secure and safe\
    \ \nflow of agricultural data between data intermediaries, farmers, and producers.\
    \ This \ninitiative will serve as a foundation for sector innovation, increase\
    \ the implementation of \n \n166 \ndigital technologies and tools, and promote\
    \ food security, sustainability, and a digitally \ntransformed sector. \nIn addition,\
    \ providing guidelines and objectives for agricultural data governance and \n\
    management will empower farmers and producers to make informed decisions based\
    \ on \ndata analysis, resulting in increased productivity and economic growth.\
    \ In summary, \nmodernizing agricultural data infrastructure and potentially implementing\
    \ policy options I \nand II are crucial for sustaining and growing the agricultural\
    \ sector. These policies will \nimprove data stewardship and ownership, enhance\
    \ sector innovation and efficiency, and \nadvance food security, sustainability,\
    \ and the digital transformation of the sector. \nOne of the key contributions\
    \ of this doctoral research is the proposal of a two-step \npolicy, which represents\
    \ an innovative approach to addressing the challenges posed by the \nFourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution and the digital transformation of the economy in the \nagriculture\
    \ policy subsystem. This policy recommendation represents an attempt at policy\
    \ \ninnovation that has the potential to facilitate the adoption of new technologies\
    \ and promote \nsustainable agriculture practices. By proposing this new approach,\
    \ this research is offering \nvaluable insights into how policymakers can adapt\
    \ to the changing technological landscape \nand ensure that the agricultural sector\
    \ is well-positioned to thrive in the future. \nMoving forward, the next recommended\
    \ step would be to conduct a stakeholder \nassessment in the agricultural sector\
    \ to identify opportunities and challenges related to \nimplementing an agricultural\
    \ data governance policy. This assessment will allow for a \nbetter understanding\
    \ of the needs and concerns of stakeholders, including farmers, \nproducers, and\
    \ data intermediaries. Based on the findings of the assessment, a collaborative\
    \ \n \n167 \nprocess can be initiated to engage stakeholders in discussions and\
    \ agreements of \ncooperation to facilitate the implementation of an agricultural\
    \ data governance policy. This \nwill require a multidisciplinary approach, involving\
    \ policymakers, industry leaders, and \nacademia to ensure that the policy is\
    \ effective, beneficial, and aligned with the digital \ntransformation of the\
    \ agriculture sector. \nBy highlighting the importance of a data-driven approach\
    \ to agriculture and the potential \nbenefits of using data as an additional product\
    \ in this sector, this study hopes to contribute \nto the ongoing conversation\
    \ surrounding agricultural data governance and encourage \nfurther research and\
    \ policy development in this area. This research underscores the need \nfor policymakers\
    \ and stakeholders to prioritize modernizing the agricultural sector and \ndeveloping\
    \ a robust data governance policy framework to ensure the future of food security\
    \ \nand economic development. \nIn conclusion, it is necessary to implement an\
    \ agricultural data governance policy that \npromote responsible data use, foster\
    \ transparency and trust, and facilitate innovation and \ngrowth in the sector.\

    \ 65 \n \n \n \n \n[vi] \nABSTRACT \n \nDigital agriculture proposes to revolutionize\
    \ the processes of production, \nmarketing, and consumption within food systems\
    \ through the use of tools that collect, \nstore, analyze, and share information\
    \ digitally. While its proponents emphasize potential \nbenefits, such as improved\
    \ technical efficiency, resource allocation, and reduced \ntransaction costs,\
    \ the understanding of the risks and challenges associated with its \nimplementation\
    \ remains limited. \nThis qualitative study focuses on exploring the social and\
    \ ethical implications of \ndigital agriculture technologies and their specific\
    \ impact on small-scale farmers. Digital \nagriculture operates at the intersection\
    \ of technology and food systems, presenting a \ncritical challenge due to the\
    \ non-neutrality of technology intersecting with an already \nhighly concentrated,\
    \ centralized, and globalized food system. Understanding how these \ntechnologies\
    \ can effectively serve resource-limited small-scale farmers and prevent \nfurther\
    \ marginalization is urgent. \nThis study investigates the current state of digital\
    \ agriculture technologies \navailable in Colombia and analyzes the perspectives\
    \ of Colombian promoters regarding \nthe promises, dangers, and implications of\
    \ these technologies. The review of the \nColombian case reveals an emerging sector\
    \ with a variety of digital products and \nservices, driven by a mix of public\
    \ and private actors, including startups, medium-sized \nenterprises, and large\
    \ corporations. The perspectives of Colombian promoters \npredominantly align\
    \ with an optimistic narrative, emphasizing the positive outcomes of \nefficiency\
    \ and productivity for adopting farmers. \n \n \n[vii] \nThis thesis provides\
    \ applicable knowledge for academia, practitioners, and the \ncommunity alike.\
    \ Its aim is to empower those with less power and agency, especially \nsmall-scale\
    \ farmers, by shedding light on the broader implications of digital agriculture\
    \ \nthat must be taken into account. This work underscores the importance of addressing\
    \ \naccess to these technologies and implementing appropriate governance to ensure\

    \ \nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION AND OUTLINE \n \nAgricultural digitalization is\
    \ inevitable; what is unknown is how dynamic and \ninclusive it will be.  \nECLAC,\
    \ FAO, IICA (2021:89). The Outlook for Agriculture and Rural Development in the\
    \ \nAmericas: A Perspective on Latin America and the Caribbean 2021-2022. \n \n\
    The newest agricultural revolution is happening today with promises to change\
    \ \norganization and relations along each step of the agri-food system and ultimately\
    \ \n“transform fundamentally” every part of it (Trendov et al., 2019: 2). The\
    \ multitude of \npossibilities for digital agriculture is impressive. It includes\
    \ farmers receiving specific \ntechnical advice on pests through mobile phones.\
    \ Farmers deciding where and when to \nuse fertilizers after considering data\
    \ provided by sensors. Farmers assessing damages \nafter natural disasters using\
    \ imagery captured by drones. Farmers making choices on \nwhen to sell and to\
    \ whom after considering marketplace data. Farmers fulfilling \nrequirements for\
    \ organic certification while using an app. Buyers verifying through \nblockchain\
    \ that small farmers are properly receiving the premium price they pay. \nConsumers\
    \ and farmers bargaining directly through marketplaces. Cooperatives using \n\
    current and historical aggregate data on their members’ farm productivity to understand\
    \ \nthe effectiveness of a specific intervention. While the benefits of this technology\
    \ are \nwidely recognized and promoted, its significant risks, albeit lesser-known,\
    \ are also \nsignificant and should not be overlooked. This research is about\
    \ the broader implications \nof these technologies for small farmers.  \nThe mainstream\
    \ narrative suggests that access to services provided by digital \nagriculture\
    \ will improve efficiency, profitability, and sustainability through a reduction\
    \ \nof transaction costs and an increase in allocative and technical efficiency\
    \ (Schroeder, \nLampietti & Elabed, 2021). In this view, data provided by digital\
    \ agricultural \ntechnologies will allow for a better allocation of physical,\
    \ natural, and human resources \n \n[2] \nwhile reducing transaction costs for\
    \ searching, contracting, monitoring, and \nenforcement. The narrative around\
    \ digital technologies is optimistic. In high-level \ndocuments —published by\
    \ the World Bank, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO), and the\
    \ Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)— \nthese technologies\
    \ are portrayed as a solution to tackle the global food shortage (Lajoie-\nO’Malley\
    \ et al., 2020). In media coverage and social media, agriculture’s digitalization\
    \ is \ndominated by positive arguments and emotions (Mohr & Höhler, 2023; Ancín,\
    \ Pindando \n& Sánchez, 2022). \nAcross the world, there is a skyrocketing interest\
    \ in this sector; global investment \nwent from $16.9 billion in 2018 to $26,1\
    \ billion in 2020 to $51.7 billion in 2021 \n(AgFunder, 2019; 2021; 2022). Nowadays,\
    \ all kinds of public and private actors are \nactively promoting and financing\
    \ the advancement of digital products and services. In \ndeveloping regions, the\
    \ increasing interest in these technologies combines efforts by \nseveral actors\
    \ united by the transformative promise of digital agriculture. For example, \n\
    since 2017, FAO and Telefonica —a multinational telecommunications company with\
    \ \nheadquarters in Spain— have worked together to leverage Telefonica digital\
    \ technologies \nby farmers in Colombia and Honduras (FAO, 2017). In 2020, the\
    \ Inter-American \nInstitute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) signed an agreement\
    \ with Precision \nAgriculture for Development (PAD) —a non-profit organization\
    \ co-founded by 2019 \nNobel Prize for Economics, Michael Kremer— to use their\
    \ proven model for mobile-\nphone-based agricultural extension across Latin America.\
    \ In May 2022, the IICA \norganized a Digital Agriculture Week with Bayer, Microsoft,\
    \ and the World Bank as co-\nsponsors; this was a space “to exchange and promote\
    \ ideas and thereby accelerate the \ndigital transformation of agriculture in\
    \ the Americas.” (IICA, 2022) \n \n[3] \nDespite a positive overall outlook on\
    \ digital agriculture, concerns about these \ntechnologies’ potential unintended\
    \ consequences and impacts are arising. Multilateral \npromoters such as the World\
    \ Bank Group (2019) have warned that digital technologies’ \nbenefits should not\
    \ be considered a panacea. FAO (Trendov et al., 2019) expressed that \nto maximize\
    \ opportunities and minimize risks in the development of digital agriculture,\
    \ \ngaps in policymaking and regulation, the economic and gender gap, the skill\
    \ gap, and the \n‘digital divide’ should be addressed. Multilaterals also are\
    \ concerned about the \nconcentration of knowledge, power, and revenue in the\
    \ hands of those who develop and \nown digital solutions and data and the potential\
    \ for exacerbating existing inequalities \n(World Bank Group, 2019; Trendov et\
    \ al., 2019; ECLAC, FAO, IICA, 2021).  \nSocial movements advocate for a better\
    \ understanding of the multiple \nimplications of digitalization. For instance,\
    \ the Nyéléni Forum on Food Sovereignty \nadvocates for transparency in identifying\
    \ the actors responsible for developing these \ntechnologies and their objectives.\
    \ This initiative seeks to reveal who controls the \ntechnologies and, consequently,\
    \ the right to utilize the generated data. Ultimately, the \nforum aspires to\
    \ use this information to shape the governance and regulation of these \ntechnologies\
    \ more effectively (Nyéléni Forum for Food Sovereignty, 2019). The Campo y \n\
    Agro Working Group is asking if large corporations will control the digitalization\
    \ process \nor if it will be governed in a more participatory manner (Via Campesina,\
    \ 2021). They \nplace the public interest and the welfare of the majority as top\
    \ priorities. ETC Group —a \nnon-profit organization monitoring the impact of\
    \ emerging technologies and corporate \nstrategies on agriculture— highlights\
    \ the risks of concentration in this sector and the \nconcern these new technologies\
    \ could disenfranchise vulnerable people while \nstrengthening people in positions\
    \ of power (Mooney, 2018; ETC Group, 2022).  \n \n[4] \nSocial scientists have\
    \ pointed out how paths of technologies could reproduce \nglobal asymmetries,\
    \ the imbalances of power related to decisions on data ownership, and \nthe lack\
    \ of policy interventions on digital technologies implications (Rotz et al., 2019;\
    \ \nRotz et al., 2019a; Bronson & Knezevicj, 2016; Bronson, 2019; Carolan, 2017;\
    \ Duncan, \n2018; Marquis, 2020; Klerkx, Jakku & Labarthe, 2019).  \nThese concerns\
    \ lie in the problematic intersection between technology and food \nsystems, where\
    \ digital agriculture takes place. On the one hand, technology is never \nneutral;\
    \ there are specific interests and intentions at all stages of the development\
    \ \nprocess, including how it is developed, by whom, who will use it, and how\
    \ it may be used. \nDigital technology’s means and ends are value-laden (Bronson,\
    \ 2022). On the other, \ndigital agriculture technologies are being introduced\
    \ into a food system that is highly \nconcentrated, centralized, and globalized\
    \ (Hendrickson, Howard & Constance, 2019). At \nthis intersection, the concern\
    \ is that introducing new technologies into an already \nunequal food system could\
    \ further marginalize vulnerable farmers while reinforcing the \npower of those\
    \ in privileged positions. Identifying and understanding the social aspects \n\
    tied to these technologies is the first step to ensure that technologies will\
    \ successfully \nserve small and limited-resource farmers. \nPaying attention\
    \ to these technologies’ implications is urgent, especially when \ninvestments\
    \ are skyrocketing and narratives surrounding them heavily showcase their \npositive\
    \ potential. Even though the scholarship considering the dynamics and impacts\
    \ of \ndigital agricultural technologies is growing (Rotz et al., 2019; Rotz et\
    \ al., 2019a; Bronson \n& Knezevicj, 2016; Bronson, 2018; Carolan, 2017; Duncan,\
    \ 2018; Marquis, 2020; \nEastwood et al.,2019) and advancing in the definition\
    \ of a research agenda (Klerkx et al., \n2019; van der Burg et al., 2019; Ingram\
    \ et al., 2022; Bellon-Maurel et al., 2022), their \nempirical work has focused\
    \ on North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, \n \n[5] \nleaving the\
    \ understanding of developing regions still unexplored. This dissertation \nresponds\
    \ to this gap and aims to offer a critical empirical view of the digital agriculture\
    \ \nsituation in Colombia.  \nThis research highlights the importance of localized\
    \ approaches, recognizes that \nthese technologies do not have the same impact\
    \ everywhere, and that the implications \nfor different actors and regions vary\
    \ in their urgency and importance. An understanding \nof where technologies are\
    \ situated in, designed in, and how they unfold in specific \ninteractions of\
    \ power structures, market and institutional arrangements, science and \nsociety\
    \ relationships, and rural development projects can lead to unraveling how and\
    \ \nunder which circumstances these technologies could fulfill their promise.\
    \ \n  \nResearch Aims and Research Questions \nThrough a qualitative inquiry,\
    \ in this dissertation, I explore the empirical \nsituation of available digital\
    \ agricultural technologies in Colombia and what implications \nit poses to small\
    \ farmers. This involves the following specific questions: \n1. What is the spectrum\
    \ of socio-ethical implications of digital agricultural \ntechnologies, and which\
    \ are can be relevant for small farmers in the Colombian \ncontext? (Chapter two)\
    \ \n2. What is the current state of available digital agricultural technologies\
    \ in Colombia \nand what are their potential implications for small farmers? (Chapter\
    \ three) \n3. What are Colombian promotors’ views on digital agricultural technologies’\
    \ \npromises, perils, and implications for small farmers? (Chapter four) \n4.\
    \ What must be considered in the Colombian context by multiple actors to ensure\
    \ \ndigital technologies support small farmers? (Chapter four) \n \n[6] \n \n\
    Pragmatism and political economy lens  \nThis dissertation is inspired by a commitment\
    \ to research that advances \nacademic scholarship, offers applicable insights\
    \ to practitioners and the community, and \nis useful for those facing less power\
    \ and agency. I used a pragmatic approach and a \npolitical economy lens in this\
    \ research.  \nPragmatism and political economy are significant traditions within\
    \ the Missouri \nSchool of Rural Sociology. In its beginnings, under the intellectual\
    \ leadership of William \nD. Heffernan, the Missourian School advanced on three\
    \ fronts: a) research as a \ncomponent of political action, b) fact gathering\
    \ as a starting point for the construction of \nknowledge and political statements,\
    \ and c) substantive democracy as the desired \noutcome of scientific investigation\
    \ (Bonanno, 2008). In this sense, the Missouri School \ntradition inspires this\
    \ work. I aim to support the problem framing on the implications of \ndigital\
    \ agricultural technologies, offering analysis and empirical evidence that can\
    \ be \nused to understand and influence the trajectories of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in \nplaces such as Colombia. \nPragmatism is a philosophical view\
    \ developed within American thought. \nDeveloped mainly by Holmes, Peirce, James,\
    \ and Dewey (Snarey & Olson, 2003), it \nconsiders that ideas are not absolute\
    \ truths looking to be discovered. Pragmatism \nsimultaneously rejects positivism\
    \ and anti-positivism because “to a pragmatist, the \nmandate of science is not\
    \ to find truth or reality, the existence of which is perpetually in \ndispute,\
    \ but to facilitate human problem-solving” (Powell, 2001, as cited by Pansiri,\
    \ \n2006). In this sense, the assessment of a theory is intrinsically tied to\
    \ its ability to solve \nhuman problems. Prasad (2021) summarizes four principles\
    \ at this philosophy’s core. \nFirst is the idea that there are no fixed foundations\
    \ to build on normative conclusions. \n \n[7] \nThe world is encountered and known\
    \ through an evolving, dynamic, and changing \nhuman experience and cognition.\
    \ Second, although normative conclusions cannot be \nachieved, there is a need\
    \ for provisional forms to solve actual problems that researchers \nshould embrace.\
    \ Third, these temporary forms should be judged by the specific \ncommunities\
    \ affected by those problems. And four is the relevance of the practical \nconsequences\
    \ of the theory. For pragmatists, considering the practical implications of a\
    \ \ntheory is the only way to assess it.   \nA political economy lens is useful\
    \ in the context of a pragmatist view. It offers a \nstarting point to analyze\
    \ social problems, paying attention to the structure and the \nhistorical, political\
    \ and economic forces behind them.  If we follow the Heffernan \nexample of fact-gathering\
    \ and building knowledge that reflects facets of problems shared \nby a specific\
    \ community, political economy offers a container to start with. This \ninterpretative\
    \ lens runs through my research and defines my decisions on qualitative \napproaches\
    \ and methods. A political economy approach presupposes that political and \n\
    economic factors are interwoven; in this view, political institutions, laws, and\
    \ power \nrelations affect economic decision-making and outcomes, and economic\
    \ conditions and \ndevelopment shape political structures and behavior. A political\
    \ economy lens helps to \n“see technology not as benign or neutral but as a reflection\
    \ of capitalism and an \ninstrument of power” (Dauvergne, 2020, p7). Through this\
    \ lens, I pay specific attention \nto identifying winners and losers —who is most\
    \ likely to obtain disproportionate benefits \nand who is not—, and the social\
    \ costs these technologies could impose on marginalized \ncommunities.   \nSeveral\
    \ food and agriculture scholars have used a political economy lens to \nexplore\
    \ the implications of technological developments in agricultural contexts and\
    \ \ncalled attention to specific aspects (Busch et al., 1991). In their view on\
    \ precision \n \n[8] \nfarming, Wolf and Buttel (1996) pay attention to the structure\
    \ of investments and the \nmodes of production that benefit from technologies;\
    \ they point out that these \ntechnologies emerged in a context where public sector\
    \ investments in agricultural \nresearch, extension, and information transfers\
    \ are decreasing worldwide, creating a \nspace where private firms can shape the\
    \ sector’s development and trajectories. They \nbring to the forefront how precision\
    \ farming benefits centralized agribusiness and \nsupports a monocultural production\
    \ practice. \nUsing the concept of Food Regime —a notion used in political economy\
    \ \nexplaining how the global food system is shaped by the interactions between\
    \ various \npolitical and economic actors— Prause, Hackfort & Lindgren (2020)\
    \ evaluate the \npromises of digitalization in the context of the third regime,\
    \ a period signed by a more \nmarket-oriented system and a promotion of an increased\
    \ liberalization of trade and \ninvestment in agriculture. They conclude that\
    \ digitalization is happening along the entire \nagri-food system and is bringing\
    \ into focus characteristics of a third regime, which allows \nagri-food companies\
    \ to use data to increase control over farmers. Using a similar \napproach and\
    \ promoting a dialogue between political economy and critical agrarian \nstudies,\
    \ Hackfort (2021) unpacks five patterns of inequality linked to digital technologies\
    \ \nin agriculture, namely, i) control over technology deployment, ii) distribution\
    \ of benefits, \niii) sovereignty over data and hardware, iv) inequalities in\
    \ knowledge and skills, and v) \ncapacity to define and solve problems.  \nUsing\
    \ a political economy lens, Rotz et al. (2019) reflect on the digitalization \n\
    process, and the winners and losers created. They warn that deploying these \n\
    technologies would reinforce the current political and economic trends characterized\
    \ by \nconcentration, market integration, and value majorly captured by powerful\
    \ actors. Their \nanalysis shows data governance and technology production as\
    \ the main challenges to be \n \n[9] \naddressed. They also suggest that open,\
    \ cooperative, and appropriate technology are \npotential pathways to advance\
    \ fairness in the production of digital data.  \nMethods  \nTo explore the empirical\
    \ situation of available digital agricultural technologies in \nColombia and their\
    \ implications for small farmers, I used case study research as a \nqualitative\
    \ approach. Case studies offer the possibility to address an event or entity with\
    \ \nidentifiable boundaries and provide an in-depth understanding of a specific\
    \ context (Yin, \n2009). Two main characteristics make Colombia an interesting\
    \ setting for this research. \nFirst, digital agriculture is a relevant promise\
    \ within the country, and the ecosystem of \nactors supporting it is flourishing,\
    \ but without being the regional leader (Viton et al., \n2019). Second, Colombia\
    \ has a complex socioeconomic dynamic including a post-conflict \nsetting, high\
    \ inequality rates, and a profound rural-urban divide which offers a rich \nscenario\
    \ to see tensions and clashes.  \nI adopted a broad definition of digital agriculture\
    \ which encompasses “any form \nof information and communication technologies\
    \ (ICTs) used in agriculture, either for \nautomated or non-automated decision-making\
    \ and practices” (Duncan, Abdulai & \nFraser, 2021. p139). This includes a wide\
    \ range of technologies, from basic mobile apps \nproviding information to advanced\
    \ systems that use data to control equipment. This \ndefinition was chosen because,\
    \ in countries like Colombia, the promotion of \ndigitalization in agriculture\
    \ encompasses a broad spectrum of technologies, ranging from \nsimple apps and\
    \ text messaging systems to cutting-edge innovations like blockchain, \nvirtual\
    \ reality, robotics, and A.I. systems for soil analysis. \nAbout Colombia \nColombia\
    \ is home to 48 million people, has 32 departments —the equivalent of \nstates\
    \ in U.S.—, and in 2021, reported an estimated GDP per capita of 6,100 USD (World\
    \ \n \n[10] \nBank, 2021). It is internationally well-known for being one of the\
    \ world’s most biodiverse \ncountries and the host of 10% of the global biodiversity\
    \ (Hanson et al., 2009). In \naddition, Colombia created a Peace Accord that in\
    \ 2016 ended an armed conflict that \nlasted 50 years.  \nAgriculture is vital\
    \ to Colombia's economy, food security, rural livelihoods, \nbiodiversity, and\
    \ social and political stability. In 2020, the sector accounted for \napproximately\
    \ 6.7% of the country's GDP, generated over $9 billion in revenue through \nexports,\
    \ and employed around 16.7% of the labor force (World Bank, 2021b). Colombia's\
    \ \ndiverse agricultural production, including staple crops and tropical fruits,\
    \ contributes to \nfood security (FAO, 2021). Approximately 30% of the population\
    \ resides in rural areas, \nwhere small-scale farming is predominant, with around\
    \ 80% of farms being smaller than \n5 hectares (World Bank, 2021a; FAO, 2018).\
    \ Colombia, as the second most biodiverse \ncountry in the world, has committed\
    \ to preserving its biodiversity through initiatives like \nthe National Biodiversity\
    \ Strategy and Action Plan (WWF, n.d.; Ministry of Environment \nand Sustainable\
    \ Development, 2012). The importance of agriculture in achieving social \nand\
    \ political stability is further highlighted by the 2016 peace agreement with\
    \ FARC, \nwhich included provisions for rural development and land reform (Colombian\
    \ \nGovernment & FARC, 2016). Promoting sustainable agricultural practices and\
    \ \nsupporting small-scale farmers is crucial for Colombia's long-term growth\
    \ and \ndevelopment. \nSmall farmers in Colombia play a vital role in the country's\
    \ economy, \ncontributing significantly to food security and rural employment\
    \ (FAO, 2019). Despite \ntheir importance, small farmers, typically operating\
    \ on landholdings of less than 5 \nhectares, often encounter numerous challenges\
    \ that hinder their productivity and \ncompetitiveness. Some of the most pressing\
    \ barriers include limited access to credit, \n \n[11] \ninadequate infrastructure,\
    \ insufficient technological resources, and a lack of training and \ntechnical\
    \ assistance. Furthermore, they are frequently subjected to volatile market prices\
    \ \nand often have weak bargaining power due to their small-scale production (Roa-Clavijo,\
    \ \n2021). \nColombia is a country with unequal living conditions between its\
    \ urban and rural \npopulations. Historically, rural poverty has been higher than\
    \ the urban and national \naverage. In 2010, rural poverty was 50.8%, compared\
    \ to 29.7% nationally and 22.9% in \nurban areas (DNP, 2011). The trend remained\
    \ similar in 2021, with rural poverty at \n31.9%, higher than the national average\
    \ of 27.7% and the urban average of 21% (DNP, \n2022). This poverty is reflected\
    \ in the lack of access to basic needs such as housing, \nservices, and education.\
    \ According to the 2018 National Population and Housing Census, \n14.28% of Colombians\
    \ lived with unsatisfied basic needs, with the average for rural \nhouseholds\
    \ being 30.48% compared to 9.53% for urban households (DANE, 2018). The \npoverty\
    \ in the country is accompanied by inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient,\
    \ \nwhich was estimated at 0.523 nationally, 0.510 in urban areas, and 0.455 in\
    \ rural areas \nin 2021 (World Bank, 2022). In the same year, 47% of the rural\
    \ population was \nconsidered poor, 45.3% vulnerable, and only 9.0% middle class.\
    \ \nThis poverty/inequality is one of the five interlinked challenges that face\
    \ \nColombia’s food system, which also includes persisting hunger and malnutrition;\
    \ \nexpansion of the agricultural frontier as a threat to biodiversity; tensions\
    \ behind the \nimplementation of the Peace Accord signed in 2016, and its first\
    \ point addressed in the \nComprehensive Rural Reform; and the battle for food\
    \ provisioning (Roa-Clavijo, 2021). \nCurrently, digital technologies are considered\
    \ an enabler of agricultural \ntransformation in the Colombian political arena.\
    \ In the National Development Plan \nproposed for 2022-2026 (DNP, 2022a), the\
    \ Colombian government includes several \n \n[12] \nangles within the pillar of\
    \ Human Rights to Food for the promotion of digital \ntechnologies for the agricultural\
    \ sector. In this national plan, digital technologies are \nconsidered tools for\
    \ enabling more and best food production; facilitators for the \nbetterment of\
    \ supply chains, leading to more efficient and secure value chains, benefiting\
    \ \nsmall farmers; and an instrument of logistics and infrastructure improvement\
    \ to reduce \nlosses of food production. Speaking specifically on the technological\
    \ extension to small \nfarmers, the Plan makes explicit the expectation of digital\
    \ technologies as an agent of \nchange,  \n“Se debe incentivar el uso intensivo\
    \ de datos y la adopción de tecnologías digitales \npara transitar hacia una\
    \ economía agraria e industrial intensiva en conocimiento, \nque facilite procesos\
    \ de reconversión productiva local y de trazabilidad del \ndesempeño de las\
    \ pequeñas unidades productivas”  \n[The intensive use of data and the adoption\
    \ of digital technologies should be \nencouraged to move towards a knowledge-intensive\
    \ agrarian and industrial \neconomy, which facilitates processes of local productive\
    \ reconversion and \ntraceability of the performance of small productive units]\
    \ (DNP, 2022a p.120) \n \nData collections and Data analysis procedures \nData\
    \ collection was conducted in three stages and included several data collection\
    \ \nforms between spring 2021 and fall 2022. \nIn the first stage, I did a literature\
    \ review to address question one —what is the \nspectrum of socio-ethical implications\
    \ of digital agricultural technologies? This review \nwas conducted using a snowball\
    \ approach. Initially, I reviewed the literature reviews by \nKlerkx et al., (2019)\
    \ and van der Burg et al., (2019); these were the most comprehensive \nreviews\
    \ available. Klerkx et al., (2019) used a snowball method and searched with the\
    \ \nword ‘digital agriculture’. van der Burg et al., (2019) searched with the\
    \ words ‘smart’, \n‘digital’ or ‘precision’ and ‘farming’ (or ‘agriculture’) in\
    \ combination with ‘ethics’. The \nsnowball was developed with three actions.\
    \ First, I checked the authors cited in their \n \n[13] \nliterature reviews,\
    \ focusing specifically on those whose research focuses on power, \nownership,\
    \ privacy, and ethics in the digitalization of agricultural production systems\
    \ \nand value chains. Second, I used Google Scholar to identify articles citing\
    \ these reviews. \nAnd third, I searched Scopus and Google Scholar using a combination\
    \ of words such as \n“digital agriculture” AND “social implications” OR “social\
    \ impacts” OR “ethical \nimplications” OR “ethical concerns” OR “ethical issues”\
    \ to find new sources. I analyzed \nthis information using matrices aimed at finding\
    \ patterns in the implications identified \nby the different authors. I chose\
    \ Google Scholar because its reach is wider —including \ntech reports and grey\
    \ literature— and allows for easier tracking of the authors who are \nciting a\
    \ particular article. This was important as I employed a snowball sampling \n\
    approach for conducting this search. The scope of Web of Science would be narrow\
    \ to \nstart this review.  \nIn the second stage, I gathered information related\
    \ to question two — what is the \ncurrent state of available digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in Colombia? I mapped the \ndigital agricultural technologies currently\
    \ available and the actors offering them. I \nemployed a multi-pronged strategy\
    \ which consisted of conducting web searches for \nvarious resources —including\
    \ Google News, Crunchbase, and the databases of FAO, \nCGIAR, and IICA— participating\
    \ in both in-person and virtual events focused on \npromoting digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in Colombia and conducting informal \nconversations with professionals\
    \ working in the field. I selected only technologies \nfulfilling two criteria:\
    \ i) they offer any technology related to the definition of digital \nagriculture\
    \ used (see annex 1), and ii) are available in the Colombian market regardless\
    \ \nof their owners’ place of origin; technologies that are still in the design\
    \ stage were \nexcluded. All technologies identified were organized in a matrix\
    \ containing: name, \nobjective, how it works, population target, name of the\
    \ seller, type of company, key \npartners, and website. Using the framework elaborated\
    \ from the literature review, I \n \n[14] \nanalyzed these technologies considering\
    \ three aspects: types of service, types of data and \ntypes of expected outcomes.\
    \ This source of information was useful to build a broad \nunderstanding of what\
    \ is being offered in the Colombian context. \nIn the third stage, I conducted\
    \ semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs \nand promoters of digital technologies\
    \ in Colombia to address questions three and four —\nwhat are Colombian promotors’\
    \ views on digital agricultural technologies? (question 3) \nand what aspects\
    \ must be considered to ensure digital technologies support small \nfarmers (question\
    \ four). Interviews were recorded (see interview protocol in annex 2), \ntranscribed\
    \ verbatim, and then coded inductively, using subquestions as a guiding \nframework\
    \ —perceptions of technology deployment promises, complexities, \nuncertainties,\
    \ and unforeseen impacts. With this bottom-up approach, I obtained \nthemes by\
    \ closely examining the interview transcripts and field notes, rather than relying\
    \ \non predefined theoretical frameworks (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008). \nOrganization\
    \ of the dissertation \nThis work is presented in five parts, including this introduction.\
    \ Chapter two \nreviews the literature on socio-ethical implications of digital\
    \ agricultural technologies. It \norganizes and synthesizes the main concerns\
    \ that social science scholars have identified \ntheoretically and empirically.\
    \ I present those aspects that are relevant in the context of \ndeveloping countries.\
    \ Chapter three offers a view of the composition of the products and \nservices\
    \ of digital agricultural technologies currently available in Colombia. I present\
    \ a \npanorama of the type of technologies available in the market, their potential\
    \ use and \nbenefits for farmers, and the actors behind them. Chapter four explores\
    \ the perspectives \nof Colombian promoters and entrepreneurs on the dynamic of\
    \ digital agricultural \ntechnologies, their opportunities, complexities, and\
    \ unforeseen impacts on small \nfarmers. Drawing on twenty-three semi-structured\
    \ interviews, I elicited their views on \n \n[15] \nthe role technology can play,\
    \ their perceptions of the complexities and uncertainties of \ntechnology deployment,\
    \ and their understanding of unforeseen impacts that \ntechnologies can have on\
    \ small farmers. \nIn the last chapter, taking the insights presented in chapters\
    \ two (literature), \nthree (mapping of the technologies in the market), and four\
    \ (perceptions of promoters), I \nrevisit the main questions and arguments proposed,\
    \ reflect on the current trajectories of \ndigitalization in Colombia and outline\
    \ areas for further research to ensure these \ninnovations support, rather than\
    \ marginalize, small farmers in Colombia.  \n \n \n[16] \nChapter Two: What Do\
    \ We Know And Need To Know \nAbout The Social Implications Of Digital Agricultural\
    \ \nTechnologies For Small Farmers? \n \n“If we can do something, such as push\
    \ technological frontiers outward, then \nshould we? And if we want to push those\
    \ frontiers outward, then what do we gain and \ngive up in doing so?” \nJames,\
    \ H. (2018:1). \n2.1 Introduction \nAdvocates and enthusiasts of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies highlight the \nmyriad benefits that these technologies offer.\
    \ According to Schroeder, Lampietti, and \nElabed (2021), digital agriculture\
    \ can increase efficiency, profitability, and sustainability \nby enabling technical\
    \ and allocative efficiency and lowering transaction costs. The \nargument is\
    \ that digital technologies provide data that allows a more efficient allocation\
    \ \nof resources, reducing the costs associated with searching, contracting, monitoring,\
    \ and \nenforcement, resulting in increased profitability and a more sustainable\
    \ environment. In \nthis light, digital services offering weather or market information\
    \ through an app could \nreduce the time used by farmers to obtain information\
    \ and make decisions; or a \nblockchain-based platform could allow traceability\
    \ across a value chain, facilitating \ncommunication, assessment, and contracting.\
    \ For others, the impacts of these \ntechnologies are broader. Rolandi et al.,\
    \ (2021) used a broad spectrum to propose a \ntheoretical grid with four impact\
    \ domains —economic, environment, governance, and \nsocial—, fourteen areas of\
    \ impact, and sixty-one outcomes of digitalization.  \nWhile both approaches indicate\
    \ that digital technologies’ potential outcomes are \nmanifold and contribute\
    \ to present digitization as an opportunity that willing people can \nseize, they\
    \ are a limited lens to see the digitalization process.  Both views —one heavily\
    \ \nfocused on efficiency and another on an extensive range of outcomes— lack\
    \ \n \n[17] \nconsideration of the forces surrounding the implementation of digital\
    \ technologies and \ntheir impact on social relationships across manifold aspects\
    \ related to farmers' activities. \nThese views seem to align with an apolitical\
    \ view of technology, resonating with the old \nValue-Neutrality Thesis, which\
    \ argues that technology is morally and politically neutral, \nneither good nor\
    \ bad (Miller, 2021). This apolitical perspective, criticized by many \nscholars,\
    \ fails to acknowledge the intricate network of power dynamics that influence\
    \ \ntechnological benefits’ design, utilization, and distribution or to identify\
    \ the problematic \nintersection between technology and food systems. As summarized\
    \ by Bronson \n(2022:p16) a view that  understands technology as apolitical and\
    \ free of politics and \ninterests, “abstracts these technologies from the social\
    \ means of their production.” \nMany voices, including social scholars (e.g van\
    \ der Burg et al., 2019; Rotz et al., \n2019; Hackfort, 2021), social movements\
    \ (Nyéléni Forum for Food Sovereignty, 2019; \nVia Campesina, 2021; Mooney, 2018;\
    \ ETC Group, 2022), and multilateral organizations \n(World Bank Group, 2019;\
    \ Trendov et al., 2019; CEPAL, FAO, IICA, 2021) are discussing \nthe potential\
    \ risks and unexpected social consequences that digital technologies may \nbring\
    \ to disadvantaged actors in agriculture and the food sector. They are concerned\
    \ \nabout how the process unfolds, who is leading it, and how the worst consequence\
    \ could \nbe a potential exacerbation of existing inequalities for the smallest\
    \ farmers. However, the \nlist of topics is too general to capture nuances, making\
    \ it inadequate for informing \npolitical debates or guiding the actions of those\
    \ shaping or contesting the process.  \nConsidering this gap, this review essay\
    \ aims to offer to applied scholars and \npractitioners a practical view to understand\
    \ key questions on digitalization in agriculture \nand to organize the main socio-ethical\
    \ implications that might be considered when \npromoting digital agricultural\
    \ technologies. This essay presupposes the need to consider \nhow power is expressed\
    \ along digitalization and the importance of localized approaches; \n \n[18] \n\
    it recognizes that these technologies do not have the same impact everywhere and\
    \ that \nthe implications for different actors and regions vary in their urgency\
    \ and importance. It \nresults from a review of academic and grey literature guided\
    \ by these subquestions,  \ni) \nWhat is under the Digital Agriculture umbrella?\
    \ \nii) \nWhat are narratives and assumptions on Digital Agriculture? \niii) \n\
    What are socio-ethical implications of digital agricultural technologies?  \n\
    iv) \nHow to open possibilities for a different digitalization in agriculture?\
    \ \nv) \nWhat do we need to know? \nThis review essay was conducted using a snowball\
    \ approach. Initially, I reviewed \nthe literature reviews by Klerkx et al., (2019)\
    \ and van der Burg et al., (2019); these were \nthe most comprehensive reviews\
    \ available. Klerkx et al., (2019) used a snowball method \nand searched with\
    \ the word ‘digital agriculture’. van der Burg et al., (2019) searched with \n\
    the words ‘smart’, ‘digital’ or ‘precision’ and ‘farming’ (or ‘agriculture’) in\
    \ combination \nwith ‘ethics’. The snowball was developed with three actions.\
    \ First, I checked the authors \ncited in their literature reviews, focusing specifically\
    \ on those whose research focuses on \npower, ownership, privacy, and ethics in\
    \ the digitalization of agricultural production \nsystems and value chains. Second,\
    \ I used Google Scholar to identify articles citing these \nreviews. And third,\
    \ I searched Scopus and Google Scholar using a combination of words \nsuch as\
    \ “digital agriculture” AND “social implications” OR “social impacts” OR “ethical\
    \ \nimplications” OR “ethical concerns” OR “ethical issues” — “agricultura digital”\
    \ AND \n“implicaciones sociales ” OR “impactos sociales” OR “implicaciones éticas”\
    \ OR \n“preocupaciones éticas” OR “ethical issues”—  to find new sources. I conducted\
    \ a search \nfor results in English and Spanish. I analyzed this information using\
    \ matrices aimed at \nfinding patterns in the implications identified by the different\
    \ authors. I found in total 52 \narticles that were relevant to this research.\
    \ Many of those come from fields as Social \nStudies of Science, Agriculture Innovation,\
    \ and Ethics. \n \n[19] \nThis paper is organized into three parts. First, it\
    \ introduces what is included \nwithin the “digital agriculture umbrella”, the\
    \ narrative behind it, and assumptions \nbehind some groups of digital technologies.\
    \ Second, it organizes the socio-ethical \nimplications in the academic literature\
    \ in two interlinked groups: aspects preventing \naccess and related to the design\
    \ of these technologies; and elements related to the \ngovernance of these technologies.\
    \ It closes with a discussion of what is missing and a \nneed to know for advancing\
    \ in a digitalization aware of its implications and responsible \nwith it.  \n\
    \ \n2.2. What is under the Digital Agriculture umbrella? \nAgriculture 4.0, digital\
    \ agriculture, e-agriculture, smart farming, FoodTech and \nAgtech are some names\
    \ scholars and industry people use to talk about digital \ninnovations in agriculture\
    \ and food production. These names often overlap in their \nmeaning, scope, and\
    \ innovations included. Despite their differences in naming, in \ngeneral terms,\
    \ all these refer to the “digitalization of agriculture,” a process under which\
    \ \nall sorts of activities conducted to produce, commercialize, and consume food\
    \ use at \nsome point digital technologies (Klerkx et al., 2019). \nSimply put,\
    \ digital technologies are “tools that collect, store, analyze, and share \ninformation\
    \ digitally, including mobile phones and the Internet” (World Bank Group, \n2019).\
    \ This broad definition of digital technologies allows the inclusion of previous\
    \ \napproaches. For example, the information and communication \ntechnologies\
    \ -ICT- included computers, the internet, mobile phones, radio, and \ntelevision\
    \ (Flor and Jimenez, 2015) and was formed under the umbrella of e-agriculture\
    \ \nor ICT4D, mainly used to transmit information to farmers. Precision Agriculture\
    \ \nincludes technologies such as drones, autonomous vehicles, GPS guidance, robots,\
    \ \n \n[20] \nsensors, soil sampling, and automated hardware and software helping\
    \ to have more \ncontrol over farming activities. Smart farming steps forward\
    \ and integrates new \ntechnologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), and Geographic \nInformation Systems (GIS), allowing the collection,\
    \ integration, and visualization of data \n(Lytos et al., 2020). These technologies\
    \ and the development of Big Data techniques and \nmethods open the possibility\
    \ of capturing massive volumes of data, varied, contextual, \nand accessed in\
    \ real-time, and running advanced analytics useful for predictive modeling \n\
    and decision-making, boosting productivity and efficiency (Wolfert et al., 2017).\
    \ The \ncomplexity and sophistication of these technologies make them potentially\
    \ “game-\nchanging technologies that can dramatically affect the way food is produced,\
    \ processed, \ntraded, and consumed” (Klerkx and Rose, 2021). Using a broad definition,\
    \ all these \ntechnologies have a place under the digital agriculture umbrella.\
    \  \nCategorizing the wide range of digital technologies used by farmers can include\
    \ \nthe degree of technological sophistication involved, their place in the commodity\
    \ chain, \nor the specific service it offers to farmers. Using a lens focused\
    \ on the level of \ntechnological complexity, Trendov et al., (2019), in a report\
    \ by FAO, identified five \nsegments of digital technologies in agriculture: (1)\
    \ mobile devices and social media, (2) \nprecision agriculture and remote sensing\
    \ technologies, (3) big data, cloud, analytics and \ncybersecurity, (4) integration\
    \ and coordination systems such as blockchain, financing \nand insurance systems,\
    \ and (5) intelligent systems such as deep learning, machine \nlearning and artificial\
    \ intelligence. This approach acknowledges the variety of \nsophistication within\
    \ these technologies but does not consider overlapping use when \naddressing specific\
    \ digital products and services. Dashboards such as the Digital Agrihub \n—developed\
    \ between Wageningen University and Research (WUR), GSMA, Grameen \nFoundation,\
    \ and the Netherlands Advisory Board on impact investing— show how digital \n\
    products simultaneously use several technologies. For example, the Tumaini Mobile\
    \ \n \n[21] \nApp, developed by the CIAT to identify major banana diseases worldwide,\
    \ is accessed \nthrough a mobile application and uses machine learning, big data,\
    \ cloud-based services, \nfield sensors, and diagnostics equipment. \nPaying attention\
    \ to the place that specific technologies have along the steps of the \nfood commodity\
    \ chain, Prause, Hackfort, and Lindgren (2020) identified 280 specific \nproducts\
    \ and services already available on the global market and grouped them into 20\
    \ \ncategories. These categories include data-based insurance, precision agriculture\
    \ \nequipment, farm robotics, digital marketplaces, and digital commodity chain\
    \ traceability \nand transparency tools. This classification shows how technologies\
    \ can be used across \nthe value chain but does not reflect their dynamic nature.\
    \ \nFocusing on what specific digital technologies offer to farmers, Porciello\
    \ et al., \n(2021) discussed nuances of four types of services, namely, advisory,\
    \ farm tools, financial \nservices, and market linkages. They used this classification\
    \ in their scoping review to \nshow the interactions between specific types of\
    \ services and particular outcomes. For \nexample, within digital advisory and\
    \ extension services, particularly under general \nagronomy, they found seventeen\
    \ studies offering positive evidence on changes and \nincome and two showing negative\
    \ changes. Within digital financial services and \ninsurance, three studies showed\
    \ positive changes in income and one with nil outcomes. \nThe open dashboard where\
    \ Digital Agrihub shares innovative digital agricultural \nsolutions uses a similar\
    \ taxonomy comprising five categories —advisory, market linkage \nand e-commerce,\
    \ supply chain management, finance, and ecosystem support. This way \nof addressing\
    \ technologies offers a structure to organize specific digital products and \n\
    services that can combine technologies and deliver particular services to specific\
    \ actors \n(e.g farmers, extensionists, consumers). This approach is more nuanced\
    \ and valuable for \nconceptual and practical purposes and enables a localized\
    \ conversation on how these \n \n[22] \ntechnologies operate, and under which\
    \ conditions can fulfill their promised benefits, and \nfor whom.     \nTable\
    \ 1 includes an overview of the digital products and services under the Digital\
    \ \nAgriculture umbrella. The primary sources for this overview are the taxonomy\
    \ used by \nPorciello et al. (2021) and the Digital Agri Hub (2022), and the digital\

    \ World Bank (Schroeder et al., \n2021) and the open dashboard published by Digital\
    \ Agri Hub (2022). \n[ 23 ] \ns\n \n \n[24] \n2.3 What are narratives on Digital\
    \ Agriculture? \nThe narrative discussed by multilateral organizations and in\
    \ news articles around digital \ntechnologies is mainly optimistic, technical,\
    \ and holding the “feed the world” imperative. In \ngeneral, the rationale is\
    \ that digitalization is going to support efficiency, productivity and \nsustainability,\
    \ three aspects required in a world expecting food demand to increase by 2050\
    \ \nlinked to a new expected two billion more people in the world’s population\
    \ —up from 7.7 billion \nin 2019 (UN, 2019)— and currently suffering from food\
    \ waste, production constraints due to \nclimate change. Carolan (2017), in their\
    \ interviews with farmers and regional food system \nentrepreneurs, learned that\
    \ at the heart of their reasoning to promote digital technologies is the \n“feed\
    \ the world” narrative, expressed in the concern to feed 9 billion people in the\
    \ near future. \nIn a similar vein, in a review of high-level documents published\
    \ by the World Bank, the U.N. \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the\
    \ Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD), Lajoie-O’Malley\
    \ et al., (2020) identified that in these documents these \ntechnologies are portrayed\
    \ as a solution to tackle the global food shortage, accompanied by a \npossibility\
    \ if increasing yields, incomes, and a reduction of harmful inputs.  \nIn social\
    \ media and materials published by international development organizations, \n\
    these emerging technologies are presented as a means to achieve technical and\
    \ practical \noutcomes. Analyzing how digitalization in agriculture is portrayed\
    \ in German media, Mohr & \nHöhler (2023) evidenced that 59% of the arguments\
    \ in their sample were pro-digitalization, \n23% were contra, and 17% were neutral;\
    \ the most frequent pro arguments are work facilitation, \nreduced fertilizer\
    \ and/or pesticide use, environmental protection and sustainability, higher \n\
    yields, and opportunities and possibilities. In a similar analysis covering tweets\
    \ in English on \nthe digital transformation of the agri-food sector, Ancín, Pindado,\
    \ and Sanchez (2022) found \nthat 80% of the sample showed a connection to positive\
    \ emotions and a link with topics related \nto sustainability and climate change.\
    \ In a critical discourse analysis on how precision agriculture \n \n \n[25] \n\
    and smart farming were portrayed on English spoken news and Twitter, Duncan et\
    \ al., \n(2021:1190) concluded that “the PA [precision agriculture] discourse\
    \ tends to not to be explicit \nabout managing political changes or ensuring just\
    \ food distribution, nor is it concerned with the \ntypes of foods that needed\
    \ to be produced to ensure sustainable and nutritious diets”. In a \ndocument\
    \ analysis of materials published by international development organizations on\
    \ digital \nagriculture for the African case, Abdulai (2022) observed that narratives\
    \ were positive and \nfocused on seven expected outcomes —bridging agricultural\
    \ information and knowledge gaps, \nproductivity gains and on-farm efficiency,\
    \ food security, climate change resilience, employment \nopportunities, gender\
    \ empowerment, and livelihoods improvements. His work highlights how \nthe rhetoric\
    \ of digitalization in this region continues on the path of the Green Revolution\
    \ and \nthat “the potential effects of digitalization, as presented in the narratives,\
    \ extends, and entrench \nthe pro-poor Green Revolution rhetoric of ‘technology\
    \ saviourism’ in Sub-Sahara” (p.9).  \nThis portrayal focused on the technology’s\
    \ technical aspects and promoting “feed the \nworld” narratives rather than examining\
    \ its political or social implications is not new. Similar \npositive claims were\
    \ made about the Green Revolution (GR) and genetically modified (GM) \ncrops (Brooks,\
    \ 2005). As it is well-known, the GR technologies were presented as a strategy\
    \ to \nimprove food crop productivity growth through new pest-resistant seed varieties\
    \ (Kilby, 2019; \nPingali, 2012). Regarding GM, the proposition was that utilizing\
    \ genetically modified crops \nresistant to pests would result in decreased input\
    \ usage, heightened yields, and the \nestablishment of more sustainable farming\
    \ practices that necessitate less off-farm work \n(Dguidegue, 2019).  Amidst the\
    \ mainly positive narratives, several negative impacts were \npointed out (Klepek,\
    \ 2012; Shiva, 2016). \nPaying attention to the narrative surrounding digital\
    \ agriculture is crucial. Narratives \nmatter: narratives and discourses construct\
    \ aspects of the world and reflect values and \nworldviews (Fairclough, 2017).\
    \  Far from being neutral, techno-optimism reflects specific values \n \n \n[26]\
    \ \nand imaginaries, is useful for specific outcomes, and is instrumental in constructing\
    \ visions of \nfutures, influencing regulations, modes of governance, and ways\
    \ of public engagement (Bain, \nLindberg & Selfa, 2020). As IPES-Food (2016) stated,\
    \ the “feed the world” narrative is one of the \nfactors serving the reproduction\
    \ of industrial agriculture, characterized by industrial-scale \nfeedlots supplied\
    \ by crop monocultures and chemical fertilizers to produce an abundance of \n\
    relatively cheap highly-processed foods;  in a context of a concentrated food\
    \ system, dominant \nactors in the current food system structure —big firms, large-scale\
    \ retailers, and international \norganizations— exert discursive power while shaping\
    \ knowledge, framing narratives, and \ninfluencing policy to adopt approaches\
    \ favorably with their problem-framing.  \nScrutinizing narratives around digitalization\
    \ is pivotal to comprehending the potential \nimplications of these technologies\
    \ on small farmers. Adopting an excessively optimistic, \nuncritical, and apolitical\
    \ stance toward digitalization can undermine our ability to hold \nbusinesses\
    \ and institutions accountable. \n \n2.3.1 What are assumptions on digital agricultural\
    \ technologies by types of \nservice? \nA palpable linear optimism holds several\
    \ assumptions in the description of how specific \ndigital technologies can serve\
    \ farmers. Three examples offer illustrations. Providers offering \ndigital advisory\
    \ usually indicate that smallholder farmers can use mobile devices to access \n\
    several pieces of information —e.g weather forecasts, market research, and planting\
    \ \ntechniques— to make better decisions to improve productivity (see, for example,\
    \ Development \nGateway, 2021). This narrative assumes a direct relationship between\
    \ reduced transaction costs \nand the possibility of making decisions based on\
    \ information. It is vital to consider that not all \nfarmers can make better\
    \ decisions based on better information, as making different decisions \nrequires\
    \ mobilizing resources that may not be available or that require household or\
    \ community \nagreements regarding labor and access (Yager et al., 2019). \n \n\
    \ \n[27] \nSellers of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors placed\
    \ on livestock to monitor \ntheir health, location, and behavior, indicate multiple\
    \ benefits, including detection of illness, \nimproved breeding, enhanced animal\
    \ welfare and reduced labor costs.  These promised benefits \nare not for every\
    \ farmer, only farmers who manage large-scale livestock operations and have the\
    \ \ncapital to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support IoT technology,\
    \ can use this \ntechnology and obtain benefits —e.g Vence (2023) is a virtual\
    \ fencing, livestock management \nsystem for cattle designed operating only operations\
    \ with over 500+ cattle. Marketplace \npromoters claim their platforms can connect\
    \ farmers to multiple new buyers, offering better \nprices and flexibility while\
    \ cutting out intermediaries. For example, Agri Marketplace, founded \nin Europe,\
    \ connects farmers to industrial buyers across the globe, while Frubana is a Latin\
    \ \nAmerican company that promises to connect fruit and vegetable farmers with\
    \ restaurants. \nHowever, not all farmers may have access to these connections.\
    \ Farmers with market options \nlocated near roads and other infrastructure are\
    \ more likely to participate in digital marketplaces \nand benefit from them.\
    \  \nIn sum, despite the assumption of general benefits, not all farmers can use\
    \ all digital \nproducts and services, or reap their potential benefits even with\
    \ access. A small-scale producer \nwith limited land may not see a significant\
    \ improvement in access to better market pricing or \nweather information. This\
    \ improved access may not translate into improved benefits, as their \nproductivity\
    \ challenges may stem not from inefficiencies, but rather from land size or market\
    \ \ndistance. As noted by Lioutas “digitalization of agriculture is also a function\
    \ of farm size” \n(2021:2).    \n \n \n \n[28] \n2.4 What are Socio-ethical implications\
    \ of Digital Agricultural \nTechnologies? \nIn the context of a bright narrative\
    \ about digital agriculture coming from all corners, \nscholars are growing emergent\
    \ literature analyzing these technologies’ implications and \nunintended consequences\
    \ (e.g., Rotz et al., 2019, 2019a; Bronson, 2022; Jakku et al., 2019; \nHackfort,\
    \ 2021; Fielke, Taylor & Jakku, 2020; Ayris & Rose, 2023).  \nThemes and categories\
    \ often overlap and range across diverse scales of analysis. For \ninstance, Hackfort\
    \ (2021) unpacks five patterns of inequality linked to digital technologies in\
    \ \nagriculture, namely, i) control over technology deployment, ii) distribution\
    \ of benefits, iii) \nsovereignty over data and hardware, iv) inequalities in\
    \ knowledge and skills, and v) capacity to \ndefine and solve problems. Ayris\
    \ & Rose (2023) identified ten ethical concerns for agricultural \nrobotics, including\
    \ trust and data, health and safety, cybersecurity, employment, energy use, \n\
    economics and performance, loss of farmer control, animal welfare, and connectivity.\
    \ Ingram et \nal., (2022) conducted a prioritization exercise to identify priority\
    \ research questions concerning \ndigital agriculture in the UK; their results\
    \ cover data governance, data management, enabling \nuse of data and technologies,\
    \ understanding benefits and uptake of data and technologies, \noptimizing data\
    \ and technologies for performance, impacts of digital agriculture, and new \n\
    collaborative arrangements. Ingram and Maye (2020) asked about the implications\
    \ of \ndigitalization for agricultural knowledge processes, farmers’ knowledge\
    \ and decision-making, \nand farmers’ knowledge networks. Lioutas et al., (2019)\
    \ identify key questions about using big \ndata in farming, including data ownership\
    \ and privacy. van der Burg et al., (2019) identify three \nthemes in the current\
    \ ethical discussion about smart farming: data ownership and access, \ndistribution\
    \ of power and impacts on human life and society. In a scoping study, McGrath\
    \ et al., \n(2023) identify trends in the literature, including work-life balance\
    \ on the farm, changes in \nskills, roles, and identities, and data ownership,\
    \ power, and security.  \n \n \n[29] \nA practical way to see this large spectrum\
    \ of topics is by considering the intersection \nbetween salient factors related\
    \ to who has access to these technologies; and factors associated \nwith how these\
    \ technologies are governed. The dynamics and possibilities happening in this\
    \ \nintersection lead to different outcomes; changing how digital products and\
    \ services are designed \nand governed can lead to different outcomes.  Of course,\
    \ these two, interactions and outcomes, \ndo not occur in a vacuum but in a broader\
    \ context, where the many facets of power have an \ninfluence. Considering how\
    \ different facets of power influence digitalization is also a key \ncomponent\
    \ in influencing the trajectories of digitalization. \nRoscigno (2011:353) explain\
    \ power in terms of social relationships; in this view, power \ncan be seen as\
    \ “an unequal relation, or inequality, based on personal attributes, institutional\
    \ \npositioning, and statuses that are defined, codified and acted upon within\
    \ historical and cultural \ncontexts.” In his summary, power has a reciprocal\
    \ and asymmetrical character, and the relative \npower of an actor is expressed\
    \ in relation to and in interaction with. This unequal relation can be \nseen\
    \ at different levels. Shackleton et al., (2022) summarize four theoretical approaches\
    \ and \nilluminate how power can be seen. The actor-centered approach (e.g, Weber’s\
    \ tradition) \nconceptualizes power as a resource or capacity that actors (i.e.,\
    \ individuals, groups, or \norganizations) wield to impose their will on others,\
    \ often resulting in zero-sum conflict and \nalliances; conflicts and alliances\
    \ are essential channels of expression, research, and analysis for \nactor-centered\
    \ power. In contrast, the institutional approach (e.g Ostrom’s tradition) centers\
    \ \npower on formal and informal rules, norms, and organizations and its possibility\
    \ to shape \npatterns of social behavior and resource access. The structural approach\
    \ (e.g Marxist tradition) \ntakes a critical view of power by situating it within\
    \ the broader political, cultural, and economic \nstructures that constrain actor\
    \ agency and reinforce social inequalities and injustices. Finally, \nthe discursive\
    \ approach draws on Michel Foucault’s influential work to understand power as\
    \ a \nproductive force that shapes social norms and individual subjectivities\
    \ through knowledge, truth \nclaims, and narratives, with individuals and institutions\
    \ acting as instruments of power. These \n \n \n[30] \nfour approaches are not\
    \ mutually exclusive and can be used to provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding\
    \ of power facets. \nThe graphic 1 present the broader context, shaped by power\
    \ facets, and the interactions \nbetween factors related to who has access to\
    \ these technologies and factors associated with how \nthese technologies are\
    \ governed. Social outcomes from technologies can be identified at the \nintersection\
    \ of these two factors and in dialogue with power facets. \n \n \nFigure 1. Dimensions\
    \ shaping the digital technologies outcomes \n  \n2.4.1 Factors shaping access:\
    \ Who is included and who is not? \nThe digital divide —generally understood as\
    \ the unequal access populations worldwide \nhave to the Internet and digital\
    \ technologies— is one of the main concerns when discussing \ndigital technologies’\
    \ development. Reports published by multilateral organizations, including \nthe\
    \ World Bank Group (2019), Trendov et al. (2019), and CEPAL, FAO, IICA (2021),\
    \ \nconsistently highlight that a lack of infrastructure and related capabilities\
    \ are one of the main \nreasons why farmers are not able to fully benefit from\
    \ digital technologies. However, the \n \n \n[31] \nquestion of who is included\
    \ and who is not covers a complex and pluralistic range of aspects and \nrequires\
    \ a multilayered and intersectional perspective. \nThe gap in access \nThe first\
    \ layer of the digital divide—lack of infrastructure to support digital technology\
    \ \naccess— is widely known and worrisome. For example, estimations regarding\
    \ access to 5G \ncellular networks —the latest generation of mobile broadband\
    \ allowing the fastest speed for data \ntransfer— show that in 2025 access in\
    \ the United States will be 55%, but for Low and Middle-\nIncome Countries, it\
    \ will only be 7%. The 2025 estimate for 4G is better at 52% for these \ncountries\
    \ (GSMA, 2020; 2020a). Data from the 2021 agricultural digitalization index \n\
    (Schroeder et al., 2021) show this gap more dramatically. In the availability\
    \ subindex, \nmeasuring the share of farmland in a country with mobile coverage,\
    \ Israel scored 95.9, Australia \n84.6, New Zealand 90.3, the United States 87.6,\
    \ Honduras 42.9, Uganda 33,7, Mexico 33.6, \nBrazil 30.0, Argentina 26.3, Nigeria\
    \ 22.3 and Bolivia 18.1. This well-known gap between North \nand South countries\
    \ helps to say something that is not surprising; some countries are better \n\
    positioned to unfold digital technologies and pursue their benefits; this unequal\
    \ scenario results \nfrom historical processes and the history of the development\
    \ project (McMichael and Webert, \n2020).  \nEvidently, these gaps between regions\
    \ are not limited to just the North and South, and \ndifferences in infrastructure\
    \ availability do not solely cause them. Two examples illustrate the \nprevalence\
    \ of multiple urban-rural gaps within developed and developing countries. In the\
    \ \nUnited States, the percentage of rural Americans having access to or owning\
    \ home broadband, \nor a smartphone, tablet, or desktop is consistently lower\
    \ than suburban and urban Americans; \nonly 72% of rural Americans have access\
    \ to a laptop, while 80% of urban Americans own one. \nThere are also differences\
    \ among racial and ethnic groups. In the United States, black and \nhispanic adults\
    \ are less likely than white adults to have a traditional computer or home \n\
    \ \n \n[32] \nbroadband (Vogels, 2021; Atske and Perrin, 2021). In more dramatic\
    \ contrast, in Colombia, the \npercentage of rural households owning a desktop\
    \ computer is 5,9%, and a tablet is 1,6%, while it \nis 32,3% and 9,3%, respectively,\
    \ in urban households. The reasons for not having these devices \ninclude high\
    \ prices, 47% rural and 51% urban; lack of interest,32,5% rural and 33.8% urban;\
    \ and \nlack of knowledge about its use, 18,7% rural and 12,3% urban (DANE, 2019).\
    \  \nWhile the lack of access is crucial, it is not the only gap worthy of attention\
    \ when \naddressing digital technologies. The digital divide is a multifaceted\
    \ phenomenon with three \nlayers. First, differences in access and availability\
    \ of information and communications \ntechnologies; second, sociodemographic factors\
    \ influencing people’s decision to use or not use \navailable technologies; and\
    \ third, an uneven capacity to benefit from the access and use of \ntechnologies\
    \ (Ragnedda and Gladkova, 2020). A comprehensive view of the digital divide must\
    \ \nconsider inequalities in access, competencies, and capacities to obtain benefits.\
    \  \nThe gender gap and data gap \nRijswijk (2022) note that in addition to this\
    \ well-known gap in access, another two gaps \nare crucial when discussing digital\
    \ technologies in agriculture, the gender digital divide and the \ndata divide.\
    \ The gender digital divide refers to the gender differences in access to these\
    \ \ntechnologies; these differences reflect the many limitations women face in\
    \ the offline world, \nincluding limited access to education, traditional gender\
    \ roles, unequal distribution of resources \n—e.g land, credit—, limited access\
    \ to infrastructure and laws limiting women’s rights and \nopportunities. In this\
    \ sense, the gender digital divide reflects an extensive social, political, and\
    \ \ncultural process where women have unequal access to resources and opportunities.\
    \  \nThe gender gap in mobile ownership and usage varies across regions. For instance,\
    \ \naccording to the Mobile Gender Gap Report 2022 (Shanahan, 2022), in Nigeria,\
    \ as of 2021, the \n \n \n[33] \ngender gap for mobile ownership1 was 5%, with\
    \ 92% of men and 88% of women owning a \nmobile phone. The situation was milder\
    \ in Mexico, with a 2% gap, and chronic in Pakistan, with \na 33% gender gap for\
    \ mobile ownership. Similarly, the gender gap for mobile internet use was \n35%\
    \ in Nigeria, with 54% of men and 34% of women owning a mobile phone, 38% in Pakistan\
    \ \nand 3% in Mexico. The ownership of different types of phones also varies by\
    \ gender and has its \nimplications since individuals who possess a smartphone\
    \ are considerably more inclined to be \nknowledgeable about mobile internet and\
    \ utilize it than those who possess a basic or feature \nphone. As reported in\
    \ the same study, by 2021, 34% of women and 22% of men in Nigeria \nowned a basic\
    \ phone, while 18% of women and 17% of men owned a feature phone; furthermore,\
    \ \n32% of women and 51% of men in Nigeria owned smartphones.  \nCinnamon (2019)\
    \ offers a nuanced view of this divide and argues that the data divide can \n\
    be seen within three data divides, i) data access, ii) data representation inequalities,\
    \ and iii) \ncontrol over data flows. Data access refers to the extent data exist,\
    \ is available, and is reliable. \nData representation implies that when data\
    \ is produced, choices are made involving specific \nworldviews. Finally, data\
    \ control inequalities refer to those asymmetric relationships between \nthose\
    \ having data —collecting, storing, and mining— and those whose data is collected\
    \ \n(Andrejevic, 2014). \n \nThe gaps in capabilities, motivations and opportunities\
    \   \nPaying attention to the level of single digital technology, McCampbell et\
    \ al., (2022) \ndeveloped and tested an approach to grasp individual factors for\
    \ the specific case of phone-\n \n \n1 In the Mobile Gender Gap Report,  mobile\
    \ ownership is defined as follows: “a person who has \nsole o main use of a SIM\
    \ card (or a mobile phone that does not require a SIM) and uses it at least once\
    \ a \nmonth” (2022, p17). \n \n \n[34] \nbased digital tools for agronomic advice.\
    \ This user readiness framework is built on behavioral \nsciences and considers\
    \ three elements to define an individual’s capacity to use a particular \ndigital\
    \ technology —capabilities, motivations, and opportunities. Capabilities are related\
    \ to the \nindividual’s psychological and physical capacity to use digital technology;\
    \ physical skills include, \nfor example, the capacity to use a smartphone; psychological\
    \ capabilities include e-literacy and \nthe capability to understand interrelations\
    \ between different phone functions. Opportunities \nrefer to external factors\
    \ —social and physical— making it possible to use digital technologies; \nsocial\
    \ opportunities include farmer’s mindset, social cues, cultural norms, and values;\
    \ examples \nof operational categories are cultural norms on how men and women\
    \ access technologies. \nPhysical opportunities refer to having time, resources,\
    \ or access to a location affording access; \nexamples include time and financial\
    \ resources to own and use a digital device and network \navailability. Finally,\
    \ motivation is linked to ‘all those brain processes that energize and direct\
    \ the \nuse of a digital technology’. These processes can be self-conscious and\
    \ include the intention of \nusing digital tools or beliefs about barriers or\
    \ pressures. They can also be automatic, including \nimpulses and reactions, such\
    \ as the desire to become digitally connected.  This approach offers \nan applied\
    \ lens to consider the several interlinked social and individual factors preventing\
    \ or \npromoting the use of a specific technology; it also helps to situate the\
    \ role that infrastructure can \nplay.  \nA multiscale approach to gaps \nThese\
    \ gaps are not binary and interact among them at different scales. Rijswijk (2022)\
    \ \nuses the conceptualization of Amartya Sen (2000) on social exclusion to offer\
    \ a perspective \nbeyond a dichotomic notion of inclusion/exclusion. According\
    \ to this framework, there are \nunfavorable forms of inclusion, for example,\
    \ when inclusion benefits are not evenly distributed \nbecause of deeply unequal\
    \ terms of participation or when “the outcome of being included is then \nthe\
    \ same as being excluded”.  Along the same line, exclusion is not monolithic and\
    \ can be \n \n \n[35] \nconstitutive, instrumental, active, and passive; Constitutive\
    \ exclusion results from societal \nstructures and norms that disadvantage certain\
    \ groups, while instrumental exclusion is \nintentional exclusion used to achieve\
    \ a specific goal. Active exclusion involves deliberate actions \nthat exclude\
    \ certain groups, while passive exclusion arises from inaction or neglect.  \n\
    Rijswijk (2022) employs these various ways of inclusion/exclusion, three gaps\
    \ —digital, \ngender, data—and three scales —single digital technology, a digital\
    \ innovation package, and a \ndigital agricultural system— to show how analysis\
    \ varies across scales. For example, when \nanalyzing a single digital technology,\
    \ the most critical divide is access to data; there are \npossibilities for subordinated\
    \ inclusion or constitutive exclusion. On the other hand, when \nreferring to\
    \ a digital innovation package, the most likely divide is data representation,\
    \ while \ninclusion can be illusive, and exclusion could be constitutive and instrumental.\
    \  \nIn sum, the question of who is included and who is not is far from being\
    \ black and white; \nit is not a matter of choosing specific individuals or groups\
    \ to “include” in a digitalization \nprocess. A key thing to remember is that\
    \ many factors reinforce inequalities regarding digital \ntechnologies —access\
    \ to infrastructure, gendered access, and access to have a voice on how \ntechnologies—\
    \ and inclusion efforts can be empty or misleading to a false sense of participation.\
    \ \n \n2.4.2 Factors on technologies governance: Who governs technologies and\
    \ \nhow?    \nBroadly understood, governance in digital technologies revolves\
    \ around how \nrelationships and interactions are organized, structured, and regulated\
    \ (Gorwa, 2019). \nGovernance of digital technologies can include aspects such\
    \ as data privacy, cybersecurity, \nintellectual property rights, accessibility,\
    \ and regulatory compliance. It also involves addressing \nthe technology’s social,\
    \ economic, and ethical implications and how it can impact different \nstakeholders.\
    \ \n \n \n[36] \nWhen paying attention to the governance of single digital technologies,\
    \ a large set of \npractical questions can be placed: who can make choices and\
    \ how these decisions are made; who \ndesigns and who is consulted; who are users\
    \ defined and approached; what is the rationale for \nmaking money; how farmers\
    \ development is envisioned; what are the decisions on price; how \nfuture scenarios\
    \ and potential economic, social and environmental implications are addressed;\
    \ \nwhat are the definitions on data ownership and privacy and how are enforced,\
    \ among many \nothers. Answers to each of these questions reflect specific values\
    \ and interests, and according to \nhow these aspects of governance are defined,\
    \ it empowers certain actors or disempowers others. \nBelow I summarize aspects\
    \ of governance that present a practical opportunity for those \nwho develop technologies\
    \ to reflect on how their approaches are situated; and for users to hold \nthose\
    \ developers accountable.  \n \nData and its challenges on ownership, access and\
    \ privacy \nData is the blood of the digital economy. Data is used and generated\
    \ on-farm and off-\nfarm. According to Maru et al., (2018), in a report published\
    \ by GFAR, GODAN, and CTA, there \nare four data streams for farming. Data created\
    \ and compiled on the farm to be used solely on \nthe farm makes up the first\
    \ stream. It is denominated “localized data” and includes information \non soil,\
    \ seed, fertilizer use, sowing date, production practices, and water use. Data\
    \ generated \nand acquired off the farm for use at the farm forms the second stream.\
    \ This “imported data” \nincludes market prices and climatic information analyzed\
    \ and tailored for use on-farm by a third \nentity that owns, manages, and controls\
    \ this data. Data generated and compiled on the farm for \noff-farm use comprises\
    \ the third stream; it is called “exported data” and can be gathered by \nfarmers\
    \ or by using advanced tools. This on-farm data is typically processed, clustered,\
    \ or \nmerged with other information generated elsewhere, and various actors use\
    \ it to make decisions. \nGovernments can target services and subsidies; banks\
    \ and insurance companies can offer \n \n \n[37] \ntargeted services and products;\
    \ researchers can design and conduct specific projects. Finally, \non-farm and\
    \ off-farm data for use off-farm make up the fourth stream. It is called “ancillary\
    \ \ndata” and includes, for example, government statistical and research data\
    \ on agriculture.  \nEach kind of data brings challenges and nuances. In the imported\
    \ data, there are \nconcerns about availability, accessibility, and usability.\
    \ On the exported data —localized data \nshared with others—, privacy, ownership,\
    \ and monetization are the pressing topics (Maru et al., \n2018). This is an ongoing\
    \ conversation in the political arena, and there are no final solutions yet. \n\
    It is a topic worthy of consideration because, as stated by Schroeder et al.,\
    \ (2021:5) in a report \npublished by the World Bank on the digital transformation\
    \ of the agri-food system, “laws \naddressing the ownership of data from digital\
    \ agriculture are frequently either missing or \ninadequate.” \nThose with access\
    \ to and ownership of data are in a different position to make choices \nand profit\
    \ from this economy.  Many critical scholars (van der Burg, Boggardt and Wolfert,\
    \ \n2019; Bronson, 2018; 2022) have raised questions about data ownership, access,\
    \ and privacy.  \nvan der Burg, Boggardt, and Wolfert (2019) show how data privacy,\
    \ ownership and \ncontrol are interlinked topics whose interaction exhibits risks\
    \ and uncertainties.  They reflect \nhow farm data — localized data by Maru et\
    \ al. (2018)— is commonly viewed as trade data rather \nthan personal data; and\
    \ how it is being produced and used in a context lacking of clear \nregulations\
    \ and in an environment marked by unequal relationships. The authors illustrated\
    \ \nthese risks with two examples. Firstly, input suppliers such as seed providers\
    \ may use data \nanalyses to offer farmers different prices or terms based on\
    \ their predicted yield or other data \npoints, which could lead to potential\
    \ price discrimination. Secondly, the presence of large \ncompanies such as Monsanto,\
    \ which provides simultaneously smart farming technologies, data \nanalysis algorithms,\
    \ and recommendations to farmers while also selling inputs such as seeds, \n \n\
    \ \n[38] \ncreates a situation where the company has privileged access to farmers’\
    \ data, which can be \nexploited to gain an unfair competitive advantage.    \n\
    Bronson (2018) offers more illustrations putting the lens on big data. This big\
    \ data refers \nto large and voluminous amounts of data gathered from digital\
    \ communication devices, \norganizing it into computer-stored datasets, which\
    \ can be analyzed through computer \nalgorithms. This data is not only localized\
    \ data, but it covers all four steams of farming data and \ncan include climate\
    \ and weather data; soil data, including pH, nutrient content, and moisture \n\
    levels; crop data, including yield, growth patterns, and pest infestation; livestock\
    \ data, including \ngrowth rates, feed intake, and health information; machinery\
    \ and equipment data, including \nusage patterns and maintenance history; market\
    \ data, including pricing and demand trends; \nfinancial data, including input\
    \ costs, labor costs, and profitability; satellite imagery and aerial \ndrone\
    \ data; social media and consumer data, including food preferences and purchasing\
    \ \nbehavior; and sensor data from IoT devices, such as moisture sensors or temperature\
    \ sensors in \ngreenhouses. Bronson (2018) stresses that big data can be sold\
    \ to third parties to be mined with \nunknown goals, which can be more corporate\
    \ and less societal. She is also concerned with large \ncorporations accessing,\
    \ owning and profiting from data that farmers help generate; she argues \nthat\
    \ this concentration can lead to a digital lock-in, benefiting larger corporations\
    \ more and \nsmaller producers less.  \n \n2.4.3 How to open possibilities for\
    \ a different digitalization in agriculture? \nRose and Chilvers (2018), Eastwood\
    \ et al., (2019), and Bronson (2019) have suggested \nthat Responsible Innovation\
    \ offers a way to foresee potential impacts and shape the trajectories \nof digital\
    \ agricultural technologies. This approach —with roots in different research traditions,\
    \ \nincluding innovation studies, science, technology and society studies, ethics\
    \ and governance and \nregulation studies (Koops, 2015)— can be defined as ’a\
    \ new approach towards innovation, in \n \n \n[39] \nwhich social and ethical\
    \ aspects are explicitly taken into account and economic, socio-cultural \nand\
    \ environmental aspects are balanced’ (Blok & Lemmens, 2015: 20). \nAccording\
    \ to the framework developed by Stilgoe et al., (2013), responsible innovation\
    \ \nincludes four dimensions, anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness.\
    \ Within this \nview, anticipation focuses on complexities and uncertainties,\
    \ identifying possible future \nscenarios and potential economic, social, and\
    \ environmental implications associated with digital \nagricultural technologies.\
    \  Reflexivity refers to “holding a mirror up to one’s own activities, \ncommitments\
    \ and assumptions, being aware of the limits of knowledge and being mindful that\
    \ a \nparticular framing of an issue may not be universally held.” (Stilgoe et\
    \ al., 2013: 1571). In this \nlight, this includes an assessment of developers’\
    \ motivations and assumptions; in practice, it \nmight imply the creation and\
    \ engagement of codes of conduct. Inclusion involves engaging a \ndiverse range\
    \ of stakeholders and incorporating their perspectives and concerns into the \n\
    innovation process; it opens the participation to public and stakeholder voices\
    \ on innovation’ \nends and means. Finally, responsiveness involves adapting the\
    \ innovation process based on \nfeedback and insights from stakeholders and the\
    \ wider community and considers the capacity to \nchange direction, react, and\
    \ answer to societal needs. \nSome scholars are using this framework to analyze\
    \ specific cases. For example, Eastwood \net al ., (2017) used it to assess a\
    \ smart dairying project in New Zealand and to draw lessons that \ncan be applied\
    \ to smart farming more generally. Ayris & Rose, (2023) used it to frame the socio-\n\
    ethical implications described in the literature on autonomous robots in agriculture.\
    \ Legun and \nBurch (2021) used the anticipation dimension of this framework to\
    \ analyze how apple orchard \nproducers in New Zealand engage with the prospects\
    \ of AI robotics. This dimension was useful \nfor understanding how farmers’ expectations\
    \ and strategies are shaped by various factors and \nhow they evolve over time.\
    \ Bronson (2019) used this framework to analyze the views of \ntechnology designers\
    \ and to elicit how inequity is present in the design of digital farming \n \n\
    \ \n[40] \ninnovations. Building on the responsible innovation framework, Long\
    \ et al., (2020) developed a \ntool that helps sustainability-focused start-ups\
    \ in agriculture, food, or energy to identify socio-\nethical issues systematically.\
    \ McCampbell et al., (2022) combined Responsible Innovation, \nHuman-Centered\
    \ design, and a digital rights framework to analyze a pilot project using a digital\
    \ \nextension to control and prevent a banana disease in Rwanda. Fleming et al.,\
    \ (2021) used this \napproach to frame a participatory foresight exercise with\
    \ stakeholders in the Australian context; \nthe four scenarios identified created\
    \ a space for a conversation on the implications of digital \ntechnology development.\
    \ Bellon-Maurel et al., (2022) used this framework to build “a research \nagenda\
    \ to foster an agroecology-based digitalization of agriculture” at INRAE, a French\
    \ national \nresearch institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment. These examples\
    \ show the potential of \na responsible innovation lens to open up conversations\
    \ about digitalization’s future and analyze \ncurrent digital products and services.\
    \   \n \n2.5 What do we need to know?  \nScholars and multilateral organizations\
    \ are concerned about the potential exacerbation \nof inequalities and the consequence\
    \ of power relationship shifts. These warnings derive from the \ninteraction of\
    \ the complex context where technologies are developed —the predominance of \n\
    industrial agriculture, the concentration of power and the expectation of cheap\
    \ food (IPES-\nFood, 2016), and how these technologies are being governed —by\
    \ big and private actors using \ndata as new means of control in a context of\
    \ lack of public policy.   Prause et al., (2020) warn \nthat digital technologies\
    \ deepen control and value extraction in the current organization of the \nfood\
    \ system, a third food regime (McMichael, 2009) characterized by neoliberal, free-market\
    \ \npolicies and the dominance of large corporations. These relevant warnings\
    \ need to be \nconsidered to move forward on a path that can change how digitalization\
    \ is occurring.  \n \n \n[41] \nThrough the blueprint that critical scholarship\
    \ is building on digitalization in agriculture, \nwe know that digital technologies\
    \ pose several socio-ethical questions about their expected and \nunforeseen implications;\
    \ also, we know that different scales —single digital technology, a digital \n\
    innovation package, and a digital agricultural system (Rijswijk, 2022)— embrace\
    \ specific \nchallenges that need to be identified and analyzed. However, there\
    \ are still many things that we \ndo not know, and we need to promote agricultural\
    \ digitalization that benefits small farmers \nworldwide.  \n \nTrajectories in\
    \ different regions, types of production and types of crops  \nWe need to know\
    \ how digitalization unfolds in low and middle-income countries. As \nnoted by\
    \ Klerkx et al., (2019), McCampbell et al., (2022), Hackfort (2021) and McGrath\
    \ et al., \n(2023), few critical studies on digital agriculture focus on these\
    \ regions. Empirical work has \nfocused on New Zealand, Australia, North America,\
    \ and Europe. Only a few analyses consider \nempirical evidence on Africa and\
    \ Latin America through a critical lens (see some examples on \nAbdulai , 2022;\
    \ McCampbell et al., 2022; Steinke et al., 2022). This understanding of how \n\
    digitalization is being promoted will need evidence across scales, addressing\
    \ how it is unfolding \nin different types of production, crops, and farmers.\
    \ In Latin America, for example, there is a \ngrowing ecosystem of digital technologies\
    \ for agriculture that are being mainly described by \nmultilateral organizations\
    \ (Loukos and Arathoon, 2021; Viton et al., 2019; Sotomayor et al., \n2021) and\
    \ some scholars are analyzing with a lens of adoption and limitations (e.g Puntel\
    \ et al., \n2022; Silveria et al., 2022; Bolfe et al., 2020). But still, our understanding\
    \ of what is occurring \nwithin countries, in specific products and across types\
    \ of production is scarce. Latin American \ncountries produce a diverse range\
    \ of agricultural commodities, e.g coffee, cocoa, beef, bananas, \nand avocado,\
    \ using different configurations of labor and in contexts with differentiated\
    \ power \n \n \n[42] \nstructures, market and institutional arrangements, and\
    \ rural development projects; because of \nthis diversity an approach looking\
    \ into particular cases is required.  \nThis empirical evidence will help address\
    \ and offer nuanced perspectives on the \nquestions posed by van der burg et al.,\
    \ (2019), who propose to explore the advantages and \ndisadvantages of different\
    \ power distributions in relation to goals, distribution of burdens and \nbenefits,\
    \ sustainability of farms,  autonomy of farmers and consumers, and the meaning\
    \ of \nvalues such as fairness, justice, just distribution, transparency and trust.\
    \ \n \nUnderstanding the different stages of tecnological developments and its\
    \ potential \noutcomes \nThe umbrella of digital agricultural technologies is\
    \ extensive and covers many \ntechnologies, varying in complexity. Despite the\
    \ hype, not all technologies are at the same level \nof market readiness or maturity\
    \ across sectors —e.g, according to FAO (2022), while robotics, \nIoT and data\
    \ analytics in livestock are closer to scaling, they are more at a prototype level\
    \ in \naquaculture. A deep understanding of the nuances —regarding what specific\
    \ technologies do, in \nwhich crops, in which region, and what outcomes— would\
    \ lead to better critics and more \nfocalized interventions. Beyond a categorization,\
    \ paying attention to the heterogeneity of \nagricultural technologies is needed,\
    \ as Stræte et al., (2022:p9) exemplify, “what works well for \ntechnologies for\
    \ goats follows different development trajectories than that for cattle, or round\
    \ \nbales, for that matter”.   \n \nInteractions of digital agriculture with ecosystemic\
    \ challenges   \nDespite narratives on digital agriculture mention sustainability,\
    \ this is more of a \nsuperficial connection since the discourse is overly focused\
    \ on technical and economic benefits. \n \n \n[43] \nConsidering that agriculture,\
    \ food production, and deforestation are three major drivers of \nclimate change\
    \ (IPCC, 2019), it is imperative to understand how digital agricultural technologies\
    \ \nimpact environmental challenges, such as deforestation and consumption of\
    \ natural resources. \nIt is not the analysis of using digital technologies for\
    \ environmental purposes, which is a \ndifferent line of inquiry, but how the\
    \ different types of digital agricultural technologies used in \nfarming or livestock\
    \ have measurable outcomes in environmental terms. Some work has been \nadvanced\
    \ by Green et al., (2021), but still much more is needed to explore through empirical\
    \ \ncases.  \nMore nuanced knowledge of how digital agricultural technologies\
    \ operate will offer \nevidence to contest dominant narratives of the benefits\
    \ of this digitalization and would inform \nsharper efforts of accountability\
    \ on their development.  \n \n2.6 Conclusion \nThe aim of this review essay was\
    \ to provide practical insights for applied scholars and \npractitioners who sought\
    \ to understand the key elements of digitalization in agriculture. It \ncovered\
    \ a range of topics, including an overview of technologies within the digital\
    \ agriculture \numbrella, the narratives surrounding them, socio-ethical implications,\
    \ and possibilities for \ndeveloping a more inclusive and responsible approach\
    \ to digitalization. The essay emphasized the \nimportant point that technology\
    \ is never neutral. Factors such as who developed it, who used it, \nand how it\
    \ was used were all influenced by the interests and goals of decision-makers,\
    \ as well as \nthe resources and possibilities available to those considered users.\
    \  \n  Because digital products and services are neither neutral nor objective;\
    \ conversely, they \nare embedded in power networks and arrangements, it is crucial\
    \ to approach digitalization with a \ncritical eye and a focus on inclusive and\
    \ responsible development. \n \n \n[44] \nChapter Three: Digital Agriculture In\
    \ Colombia: What Is \nAvailable, By Whom, To Where Is It Leading? \n3.1 Introduction\
    \ \nAs in many countries in which the agricultural sector is essential for the\
    \ economy and \nlivelihoods, Colombia is interested in the potential use of digital\
    \ technologies in agriculture. This \nis explicit in the National Developing Plan\
    \ proposed for 2022-2026, where digital agricultural \ntechnologies are essential\
    \ for creating technologically advanced supply chains, sustainable \nproduction\
    \ systems, and e-commerce, supporting efficiency, security, traceability, and\
    \ \ntransparency in commercialization processes that benefit small farmers. In\
    \ this Plan, these \ntechnologies are means to facilitate a “transition towards\
    \ a knowledge-intensive agricultural and \nindustrial economy, which facilitates\
    \ local productive reconversion processes and traceability of \nthe performance\
    \ of small productive units.\" (DNP, 2022 p.120). Amidst the expectations \nregarding\
    \ these technologies, it is unclear whether Colombia's current configuration of\
    \ digital \nproducts and services is moving toward meeting these expectations.\
    \ This study aims to provide \nan overview of the products and services of digital\
    \ agricultural technologies currently available \nin Colombia and to examine their\
    \ possible trajectories. \nDigital agricultural technologies are anticipated to\
    \ change relationships within food \nsystems by affecting the production, distribution,\
    \ and consumption processes (Trendov et al., \n2019; Schroeder et al., 2021).\
    \ Scholars have pointed out the positive, negative, and uncertain \nchallenges\
    \ and opportunities associated with digitalization, including, in general, the\
    \ potential \nexacerbation of inequalities (Hackfort, 2021; Rotz et al., 2019,\
    \ 2019a) and affectations along \nmany factors, including trust, health and safety,\
    \ sustainability and environment, regulation, \ndata, employment, and economic\
    \ impacts (Rose et al., 2021; McGrath et al., 2023). Despite the \nhigh expectations\
    \ generated by digital agriculture and its many nuances, little empirical \nresearch\
    \ has been conducted to understand how digital agriculture unfolds within countries,\
    \ \nparticularly developing countries (Klerkx et al., 2019; McCampbell et al.,\
    \ 2022).   \n \n \n[45] \nUnderstanding the configurations of available digital\
    \ products and services —actors \ninvolved, services offered, and types of target\
    \ farmers— is crucial for both scholars and \npolicymakers. By understanding the\
    \ configurations of available digital agricultural technologies \nin Colombia,\
    \ scholars can contribute to research and knowledge production that addresses\
    \ the \ncountry's unique challenges and opportunities in agriculture related to\
    \ rural inequality and the \nchallenges of biodiversity conservation and climate\
    \ change. Practitioners can enable better \ndecision-making for promoters, prioritize\
    \ conversations that need to occur based on the \npotential impacts of technologies,\
    \ and make better investment allocations to inclusively and \nresponsibly promote\
    \ digital agriculture.  \nThis study is situated in the growing literature on\
    \ the social and ethical implications of \ndigital agricultural technologies (van\
    \ der Burg et al., 2019; Rotz et al., 2019; Bronson, 2022; \nAyris & Rose, 202).\
    \ To conduct the analysis, I used service types as the basis (Porciello et al.,\
    \ \n2021). For each service type, I investigated the type of data involved (Maru\
    \ et al., 2018) and \nexpected results (Porciello et al., 2021; Rolandi et al.,\
    \ 2021). I also consider the potential \npatterns of inequality from the deployment\
    \ of digital agriculture (Hackfort, 2021). This \napproach allows for a nuanced\
    \ exploration of what technology does and the types of results that \ncan be expected.\
    \ In this way, the analysis captures specificity and informs scholars, civil society,\
    \ \npolicymakers, and entrepreneurs interested in participating in how digital\
    \ agricultural \ntechnologies unfold in a particular territory. \nThis study contributes\
    \ to the nascent literature on Latin America by examining the \nconfiguration\
    \ of digital agriculture in a particular Latin American country. Currently, reports\
    \ \ndeveloped by multilateral organizations have mainly described the digital\
    \ agriculture situation \nand offered insights into why it is relevant and how\
    \ it is configured in different countries. For \nexample, the Inter-American Development\
    \ Bank and its Innovation Laboratory (IDB LAB) \npublished reports describing\
    \ the situation of the agtech entrepreneurial ecosystem. These \n \n \n[46] \n\
    include Viton et al., (2019), who offer a bird’s eye view of the sector's size,\
    \ innovations, and \nperformance by country; according to this review, in 2018,\
    \ 5 percent of the 457 start-ups in \nLatin America working on new agriculture\
    \ technologies were in Colombia. It also includes the \nwork of Loukos and Arathoon\
    \ (2021), who offered market mapping, identification of trends, and \nrecommendations\
    \ for the digital agriculture ecosystem after examining 131 digital agricultural\
    \ \ntools used in Latin America.  Other studies have focused on specific technologies\
    \ and countries. \nIn a report by the IICA, Grasso (2022) explored the blockchain\
    \ situation for Latin American \nagriculture and identified 29 blockchain solutions,\
    \ including one from Colombia. Some studies \noffer insights into specific countries,\
    \ such as Argentina (Munoz et al., 2021) and Honduras and \nHaiti (Strategic Impact\
    \ Advisors, 2022, 2022a); however, a critical perspective that considers \nsocial\
    \ implications is missing. In this sense, this study is an exploratory endeavor\
    \ to critically \nunderstand what is available in the Colombian digital agricultural\
    \ technology market.  \nThis study presents a panorama of the types of digital\
    \ products and services available in \nthe Colombian market, their potential uses\
    \ and benefits for farmers, and the actors behind \nthem. These results arise\
    \ from a mapping exercise conducted with secondary information, \nguided by the\
    \ following sub-questions: (i) What initiatives currently promote digital agricultural\
    \ \ntechnologies in Colombia? (ii) Which products and services of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies \nare currently available in the Colombian agricultural context?\
    \ (iii) What types of actors sell \nthem, and to whom? (iv) What implications\
    \ can be anticipated for small-scale farmers?  \nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized into three parts. First, it introduces a \nframework to analyze the\
    \ configuration of digital technologies available in the market, focusing \non\
    \ the specific type of service offered, potential outcomes, and particular social\
    \ implications that \ncould arise. Second, it provides a background of the Colombian\
    \ case and introduces data \ncollection and data analysis procedures. Finally,\
    \ it discusses results of the current configuration \nof digital technologies\
    \ in Colombia across five types of services: Digital Advisory & Extension, \n\
    \ \n \n[47] \nDigitized Farm Tools, Digital, Financial Services, Digital Market\
    \ Linkages, and Supply chain \nmanagement. The chapter concludes with a discussion\
    \ of potential pathways derived from these \nconfigurations, their implications\
    \ for small farmers, and aspects to consider for making this \nconfiguration more\
    \ inclusive.  \n \n3.2 A Framework for analyzing digital agricultural technologies\
    \  \nTo understand the configurations of digital agricultural technologies available\
    \ to farmers \nin Colombia, I used service types as the backbone and added three\
    \ layers: types of data, expected \nresults, and patterns of inequality. Below,\
    \ I introduce these elements: \n \nService Types and expected outcomes \nPorciello\
    \ et al., (2021), Digital Agri Hub (2021), and Loukos and Arathoon (2021) use\
    \ a \ncategorization of services offered by digital agricultural technologies.\
    \ Service types allow for an \nunderstanding of the specific social relationships\
    \ that may be affected by digital technologies, \nthe actors involved, and the\
    \ risks and uncertainties that can arise. The five types of services \noffered\
    \ to farmers through digital products and services are i) advisory, ii) farm tools,\
    \ iii) \nfinancial services, iv) market linkages, and v) supply chain management\
    \ (Porciello et al., 2021). \nEach of these categories is broad and can contain\
    \ subcategories that add nuances to each type of \nservice (Loukos and Arathoon,\
    \ 2021). Table 2 offers a summary of these service types and \npotential subcategories;\
    \ I selected those subcategories that are particularly relevant to \nColombia's\
    \ situation.   \n \n \nTable 2. Service Types, subcategories, and expected outcomes\

    \ 48] \ns\n \n \n \n[49] \nTypes of data \nAccording to Maru et al. (2018), agriculture\
    \ has four distinct data streams. First, \"localized \ndata,” consists of information\
    \ generated and collected on the farm for exclusive on-farm use, such \nas soil\
    \ composition, seed types, fertilizer usage, planting dates, farming techniques,\
    \ and water \nconsumption. The second is \"imported data,\" which involves data\
    \ gathered off-farm and applied \non-farm. These data include market prices and\
    \ weather information, which are analyzed and \ncustomized for on-farm applications\
    \ by a separate entity that owns, oversees, and regulates the \ndata. The third\
    \ is \"exported data,\" which includes data gathered and organized on the farm\
    \ for \noff-farm utilization. These data can be collected by farmers themselves\
    \ or through sophisticated \ntools, and are typically processed, grouped, or combined\
    \ with other data from various sources, \nenabling different stakeholders to make\
    \ informed decisions. Governments can direct services and \nsubsidies, financial\
    \ institutions and insurance providers can offer specialized services and \nproducts,\
    \ and researchers can devise and execute targeted projects. Finally, the \"ancillary\
    \ data\" \ncomprised both on-farm and off-farm data used for off-farm purposes.\
    \ Each data type presents \nseveral challenges. According to Maru et al. (2018),\
    \ localized and exported data share challenges \nin privacy, ownership, monetization,\
    \ and monopoly, and imported data have access challenges in \nterms of availability,\
    \ accessibility, and usability.  Table 3 illustrates the types of data that can\
    \ \npotentially be found and used for each type of service.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \n \nPotential patterns of inequality   \nThere are many social and ethical\
    \ aspects to pay attention to when considering the impacts \nof digital agricultural\
    \ technologies. Hackfort (2021) described five patterns of inequality linked to\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture.  \nIn the first one —inequalities in\
    \ control over technology deployment— the main factors \nshaping it are the relevant\
    \ role that big ag and tech corporations play to control technology \ndevelopment,\
    \ technical lock-ins that limit farmers' options and the lack of interoperability\
    \ —this \ninability of different systems, devices, or software applications to\
    \ communicate, exchange, and \nuse information effectively with each other hinders\
    \ seamless data exchange and integration, \nlimiting the potential for efficient\
    \ decision-making and optimal resource management in \nagricultural practices.\
    \  In the second pattern —the unequal distribution of benefits— the concerns \n\
    are that innovation focuses on capital-intensive approaches that favor large-scale\
    \ agricultural \noperations; the disparity in access to digital infrastructure\
    \ exacerbates the divide between urban \nand rural farmers; and asymmetry in financial\
    \ risks, where farmers face significant risks while \n \n \n \n[51] \ntechnology\
    \ providers gain advantages from utilizing data provided by farmers at no cost.\
    \  In the \nthird pattern, —uneven sovereignty over data and hardware— the concern\
    \ is that technology \nproviders dominate data storage, imbalances in bargaining\
    \ power put farmers at a disadvantage, \nand private licensing agreements and\
    \ legal restrictions that can prevent farmers from accessing \ntheir farm data\
    \ and may even prohibit self-repair of hardware. In the fourth pattern, — \ninequalities\
    \ in knowledge and skills— the worrisome elements are unequal digital literacy,\
    \ a \ngrowing dependency on providers of big-data and the disadvantage that farmers\
    \ with fewer \nresources can have to hire skilled employees.  Finally, in the\
    \ fifth pattern —unequal problem \ndefinition and problem-solving capacities—\
    \ aspects causing concern are the relevance of \nproductivist solutions to structural\
    \ problems and the fixation on fixation on technological \nsolutions detract from\
    \ alternative approaches.  \n   \n3.3 Context \nAgriculture is vital to Colombia's\
    \ economy, food security, rural livelihood, biodiversity, \nand social and political\
    \ stability. In 2020, the sector accounted for approximately 6.7% of the \ncountry's\
    \ GDP, generated over $9 billion in revenue through exports, and employed about\
    \ 16.7% \nof the labor force (World Bank, 2021b). Colombia's diverse agricultural\
    \ production, including \nstaple crops and tropical fruits, contributes to food\
    \ security (FAO, 2021). Approximately 30% of \nthe population resides in rural\
    \ areas, where small-scale farming is predominant, with around 80% \nof farms\
    \ being smaller than five hectares (World Bank, 2021; FAO, 2018). The importance\
    \ of \nagriculture in achieving social and political stability is further highlighted\
    \ by the 2016 peace \nagreement with the FARC, which includes provisions for rural\
    \ development and land reform \n(Colombian Government & FARC, 2016). Promoting\
    \ sustainable agricultural practices and \nsupporting small-scale farmers are\
    \ crucial for Colombia's long-term growth and development. \nHistorically, rural\
    \ poverty has been higher than the urban and national averages. In 2021, rural\
    \ \n \n \n \n[52] \npoverty was 31.9%, which is higher than the national average\
    \ of 27.7% and urban average of 21% \n(DNP, 2022).   Table 4 presents an illustration\
    \ of the general indicators for this sector. \nSmall farmers in Colombia face\
    \ significant challenges in accessing infrastructure and \nother resources relevant\
    \ to productivity, including low yields, insufficient resources to improve \n\
    their main activities, such as irrigation systems, agricultural practices, and\
    \ industrial machinery, \nand poor access to agro-climatic information. (Lopez-Barrera\
    \ et al., 2022; Martinez et al., 2016) \nAccording to Katz et al. (2021), in a\
    \ report commissioned by the Ministry of \nTelecommunications and Bogota Chamber\
    \ of Commerce, the adoption of mature digital \ntechnologies is still low among\
    \ companies in the agricultural sector; only 57% of employees use \nthe Internet\
    \ for their work, and the sector has limited development in supply chain and \n\
    distribution channels. For instance, only 24% of companies in the sector purchase\
    \ inputs online \nand only 27% use the Internet for their sales. The slow digital\
    \ transformation of the sector is due \nto several barriers and risks, such as\
    \ resistance to change, limited budgets, lack of clear \nresponsibility, and lack\
    \ of resources. Moreover, the sector faces challenges such as poor \nbroadband\
    \ coverage in rural areas, lack of training in technological and administrative\
    \ areas, and \nlow adoption of advanced technologies, such as the Internet of\
    \ Things, robotics, and artificial \nintelligence. \nTable 4. Illustrative data\

    \ \nThis qualitative study examined the Colombian configuration of available digital\
    \ \nagricultural technologies. It explores the following questions: (i) What initiatives\
    \ currently \npromote digital agricultural technologies in Colombia? (ii) Which\
    \ products and services of digital \nagricultural technologies are currently available\
    \ in the Colombian agricultural context? (iii) What \ntypes of actors sell them,\
    \ and to whom? (iv) What implications can be anticipated for small-scale \nfarmers?\
    \ \nIn this study, I used a broad definition of digital agriculture. Following\
    \ Duncan, Abdulai \n& Fraser  (2021. p139), here digital agriculture encompasses\
    \ \"any form of information and \ncommunication technologies (ICTs) in the agricultural\
    \ field, either to make automated or non-\nautomated decisions and practices\"\
    . This can include anything from simple mobile apps that \nprovide information\
    \ to farmers to advanced automated systems that use data to control the \nequipment\
    \ and devices. This broad term encompasses all the forms of digital technology\
    \ used to \nimprove the efficiency and productivity of agricultural operations.\
    \ I made this decision because, \nin developing countries such as Colombia, initiatives\
    \ promoting the digitalization of agriculture \ncover a large spectrum of digital\
    \ technologies, including less advanced technologies (e.g., simple \nmobile apps,\
    \ text messaging systems, soil moisture, temperature sensors, and human-operated\
    \ \ndrons) and cutting-edge innovations such as blockchain, virtual reality systems,\
    \ robotics, and \nartificial intelligence systems for soil analysis, among others.\
    \     \n \nSearching strategy \nI used a combined search strategy. I conducted\
    \ web searches for different resources (see \nTable 5), conducted in-person and\
    \ virtual participant observations in specialized events \npromoting digital agricultural\
    \ technologies in Colombia, and had informal queries with \nprofessionals working\
    \ there. During web searches, when possible, for the nature of the source, I \n\
    \ \n \n \n[54] \nused a list of keywords drawn from various lists of technologies\
    \ (Prause et al., 2020; Trendov et \nal., 2019) (see Annex 1). During the search,\
    \ I combined “agricultura digital” (Spanish for digital \nagriculture\") and Colombia,\
    \ and the name of technologies with Colombia and “productores” and \n“pequeños\
    \ productores” (Spanish for producers and small producers\"). The search was conducted\
    \ \nbetween September 2020 and May 2022. An update was performed in March 2023.\

    \  \n \nDuring this search, I also identified initiatives with an active national\
    \ scope during 2022 \nand the onset of 2023.  \n \nData selection and organization\
    \ \nInitiatives were included if they are active during 2022 and the onset of\
    \ 2023 and are \ncompletely focused on digital agriculture, or at least a major\
    \ component. Digital products and \nservices were included when fulfilling three\
    \ criteria: i) fitting into the list of technologies, ii) \nhaving headquarters\
    \ in Colombia or being marketed in the country by international companies, \n\
    and iii) already in the market — I exclude technologies in the design stage. \n\
    \ \n \n \n[55] \nAll digital products and services identified were organized in\
    \ a matrix considering the \nname, objective, how it works, population target,\
    \ name of the seller, type of company, key \npartners, and website. Using the\
    \ zoomed-in framework presented in the previous section, I \nanalyzed these digital\
    \ products and services considering three aspects: types of service, types of\
    \ \ndata, and types of expected outcomes. \nInitially, 139 digital agricultural\
    \ products and services that met three predetermined \nselection criteria were\
    \ identified. To complete the analysis matrix, a thorough review of each \norganization's\
    \ website, social media presence, and available news articles was conducted. In\
    \ some \ninstances, it was observed that only general information was present\
    \ on the website, with no clear \nindication of the most recent update or current\
    \ availability of the service. Under such \ncircumstances, social media channels\
    \ and news articles were examined in greater detail to \ndetermine whether the\
    \ product or service remained in the market. Entries were removed from the \n\
    results when the information was insufficient or when the product or service did\
    \ not have a direct \napplication for farmers. A total of 43 of the 139 initially\
    \ identified entries were eliminated from \nthe final analysis. The 93 digital\
    \ products and services identified were illustrative, considering \nthat Viton\
    \ et al. (2019) found 23 digital products for Colombia and Loukos and Arathoon\
    \ (2021) \nfound 131 for Latin America.  \nChallenges and Limitations \nThis study\
    \ primarily relied on information sourced from the official websites of each \n\
    company and general news outlets. However, it is important to acknowledge that\
    \ the content \navailable on these platforms is directly generated by the respective\
    \ companies themselves, with \nthe purpose of conveying specific messages that\
    \ promote the sales of their products or services. \nConsequently, while such\
    \ information is valuable for obtaining a broad understanding, it may not \nsufficiently\
    \ capture the intricacies underlying business decisions and the associated business\
    \ \nmodels. \n \n \n \n[56] \n \nTo gain a deeper comprehension of these aspects,\
    \ it is recommended to conduct specific \ncase studies that delve into the individuals\
    \ responsible for decision-making processes, the \nmethodologies employed, and\
    \ the underlying rationale. However, given the scope of this research, \nthese\
    \ nuanced analyses fall outside its purview. \nThis study provides a non-exhaustive\
    \ overview of digital products and services currently \navailable in the Colombian\
    \ agricultural market based on observations made during a specific time \nframe.\
    \ Although digital technology is a fast-paced market, this review of available\
    \ technologies \nallows us to identify patterns and trends in the current digital\
    \ agriculture market and advance the \nconversation of their potential trajectories.\
    \ \n \n3.5 Findings \n3.5.1 What initiatives currently promote digital agricultural\
    \ technology in \nColombia?   \nAlthough Colombia is not the Latin American leader\
    \ in digital agriculture, it is among the \ntop five countries, with most digital\
    \ innovations unfolded in regional technologies (Viton et al., \n2019). The interest\
    \ in promoting these technologies seems mainly present at the national level,\
    \ \nwith public and private endeavors calling for the sector's development and\
    \ looking for projects \nreaching farmers nationwide. Below is a panorama of projects\
    \ with an extensive range in 2022 \nand/or unfolding by the beginning of 2023.\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[57] \nPromoting National Digital Extension \nPublic\
    \ agricultural digital extension service: In October 2021, the public Rural \n\
    Development Agency2, started a pilot to offer a public agricultural digital extension\
    \ service. This \nservice was presented as a “strategy to expand coverage, supplement\
    \ in-person services, and \nprovide small-scale farmers with access to information,\
    \ resources, markets, financing, and \ntraining\" (EPSEA UTP and ADR, 2023: p4).\
    \ The service combines WhatsApp with calls, text \nmessages, podcasts, and videos\
    \ (Agencia de Desarrollo Rural,2021). This initiative, executed by a \npublic\
    \ university, took a top-bottom approach, and defined the value chains to be considered\
    \ and \nthe users to reach at the local level based on regional dialogues with\
    \ public entities and priorities \nwritten on the Regional Plans for Agricultural\
    \ Extension and the Comprehensive Strengthening \nPlans per Producer. According\
    \ to their indicators, the program included 57 value chains —12 \nlivestock and\
    \ 45 agricultural— in 30 of Colombia’s 32 departments. The project targeted 187.981\
    \ \nfarmers, of whom approximately 52% were women.  At the end of 2022, the program\
    \ was \nsuspended, while waiting for guidelines to be offered by the new government,\
    \ which started \noperations in August 2022. By February 2023, the future path\
    \ of this service was still unclear. \nStill, the team was working on finishing\
    \ knowledge management of the process, learning, and \nidentifying good practices\
    \ (A. Londoño, personal communication, February 1, 2023). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    2 Public entity under the branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\
    \ in charge \nof managing, promoting, and providing financial support for agricultural\
    \ and rural development aimed at \ntransforming rural areas and executing programs\
    \ with regional impacts. \n \n \n \n[58] \nPutting together open and public data\
    \ for agriculture in Colombia \nTwo public entities, IDEAM3 and AGROSAVIA4, have\
    \ been developing open information \nservices to improve decision-making to enhance\
    \ productivity and competitiveness.  IDEAM \ndeveloped the app “Mi Pronóstico”\
    \ to offer access to real-time information on weather forecasts, \nsatellite images,\
    \ and early warning alerts (IDEAM, 2017). AGROSAVIA has seven open \ninformation\
    \ systems that focus on different stakeholders and needs. For example, ViMaZ is\
    \ a \ngeospatial application that displays agricultural information for the Zulia\
    \ irrigation district in a \ndepartment; HornillApp helps users without specialized\
    \ knowledge to estimate the dimensions \nand economic value of an efficient thermal\
    \ panel for sugar cane production; Más Bienestar is a \nfree application designed\
    \ to evaluate and improve bovine well-being in specialized dairy systems; \nand\
    \ M.A.P.A is a technological tool that helps increase local capacity for making\
    \ decisions to \nimprove crop system adaptation to climate change and climate\
    \ variability (AGROSAVIA, 2023).  \n \nDigital technologies in the National Development\
    \ Plan \nIn the National Development Plan proposed for 2022-2026, the Colombian\
    \ government, \nruled by Colombia’s first leftist leader, includes several angles\
    \ within the Human Rights to Food \npillars to promote digital technologies for\
    \ the agricultural sector (DNP, 2022). Their views on \ndigital technologies are\
    \ summarized in the following statement:  \n“El uso intensivo de datos (monitoreo\
    \ y seguimiento de cosechas y de producción, \nresultado de la adopción de tecnologías\
    \ y cumplimiento de estándares, aceptaciones y \nrechazos de posibles compradores,\
    \ entrada a segmentos de compras públicas) y la \nadopción de tecnologías digitales,\
    \ permitirá transitar hacia una economía agraria e \n \n \n3 Institute of Hydrology,\
    \ Meteorology, and Environmental Studies, is responsible for producing and \n\
    disseminating information related to hydrology, meteorology, and environmental\
    \ studies. \n4 Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research, aims to promote\
    \ scientific knowledge and \ntechnological innovations in the agricultural sector.\
    \ \n \n \n \n[59] \nindustrial intensiva en conocimiento, que facilite procesos\
    \ de reconversión productiva \nlocal y de trazabilidad del desempeño de las pequeñas\
    \ unidades productivas.” \n [The intensive use of data (monitoring and tracking\
    \ of crops and production, \noutcomes of technology adoption and compliance with\
    \ standards, acceptance and \nrejection by potential buyers, entry into public\
    \ procurement segments) and the adoption \nof digital technologies will allow\
    \ for the transition towards a knowledge-intensive \nagricultural and industrial\
    \ economy, facilitating local productive reconversion processes \nand traceability\
    \ of performance of small production units] (DNP, 2022 p.121) \n \nIn other sections\
    \ of this national plan, digital technologies are presented as tools for \nenabling\
    \ more and better food production; facilitators for the betterment of supply chains,\
    \ \nleading to more efficient and secure value chains, benefiting small farmers;\
    \ and an instrument \nof logistics and infrastructure improvement to reduce losses\
    \ of food production. Speaking \nspecifically on the technological extension to\
    \ small farmers, the plan makes explicit the \nexpectation of digital technologies\
    \ as an agent of change. The plan was presented in February \n2023 and is currently\
    \ undergoing a review by the Colombian Congress. Until May 2023, they \nhad to\
    \ study, analyze, and approve the document, which will then become a National\
    \ Law.    \n \nLinking digital agriculture to climate action \nSustainable Agricultural\
    \ Colombia is a 5-year project with funding of US$99,9 million, \naiming to reduce\
    \ the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate threats to minimize\
    \ their \nimpact on the competitiveness of the Colombian agricultural sector.\
    \ This project, which began in \nNovember 2022, is financed through a combination\
    \ of financial resources from the \nDevelopment Bank of Latin America, the Government\
    \ of Colombia, agricultural research \ninstitutions (Alliance Bioversity-CIAT,\
    \ CYMMIT, and CIPAV), and agricultural producer \nassociations in Colombia, as\
    \ well as resources from both loans and concessional funds (grants) \nfrom the\
    \ Green Climate Fund (Colombia Agropecuaria and Sostenible, 2023). \n \n \n \n\
    [60] \nThe main objective of this project is to enhance the resilience of agricultural\
    \ production \nagainst climate-related risks, mitigate their negative impact on\
    \ the competitiveness of the \nColombian agricultural industry, and ensure consistent\
    \ and high-quality food supply through \nthe reinforcement of climate risk management.\
    \ This will also contribute to reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions and harmful\
    \ effects of agricultural production. It comprises three components: i) \ndigital\
    \ agriculture and climate services to modernize agricultural extension services\
    \ with an \nemphasis on adaptation and mitigation; ii) genetic improvement, crop\
    \ management techniques, \ntechnological options, and scaling to increase resilience\
    \ and promote low-carbon agricultural \ndevelopment; and iii) innovative and inclusive\
    \ business models through modernized innovation \nsystems and a more committed\
    \ financial sector. The project is anticipated to directly benefit \nover 619,691\
    \ individuals, comprising 194,871 rural producers and their respective families,\
    \ and \nindirectly benefit approximately 347,996 producers. The project is targeting\
    \ 8 crops, including \nrice, sugar cane and panela sugar cane, coffee, livestock,\
    \ corn, musaceae and potato. The digital \nagriculture component aims to reach\
    \ 126,394 farmers, 1,532 technicians, and nine crops across \n139 municipalities\
    \ (Colombia Agropecuaria and Sostenible, 2023). By March 2023, the project \n\
    was completing its team and conducting regional workshops to socialize their aims\
    \ and scope. \n \n \n \nAgrifood tech innovation hub  \nAgcenter was launched\
    \ in late 2022 in Medellin (Antioquia) as an agrifood tech \ninnovation hub, “seeking\
    \ to energize the ecosystem in Colombia, encourage ecosystem \narticulation through\
    \ connections between actors, promote the development of global solutions \nfor\
    \ the sector, attract talent and investment, and accelerate agrifood entrepreneurship”\
    \ (Agtech, \n2023, para. 1). Agcenter aims to become a national and Latin American\
    \ hotspot for companies, \n \n \n \n[61] \npublic entities, investors, and all-size\
    \ farmers, to develop initiatives to accelerate digital \ninnovations by startups,\
    \ facilitate investment, and promote open innovation.  \nThis hub was conceived\
    \ by Ricardo Jaramillo, the founder of two initiatives focused on \nthe agriculture\
    \ sector, including a virtual marketplace where farmers could buy all kinds of\
    \ \nagricultural inputs, and a company focused on the organization of specialized\
    \ agricultural \nevents. The idea was pitched and became a collective project\
    \ led by the Antioquia government, a \nlarge private NGO promoted by leading companies\
    \ in Medellin, and the largest public university \nin the department (S. Henao,\
    \ personal communication, November 2, 2022).  Agcenter started \noperations with\
    \ an approved seed capital of USD 673.000 donated by the provincial government\
    \ \nof Antioquia. By 2027, this hub aims to accelerate at least 200 startups,\
    \ connect more than 300 \nto the corporate market, and have a fund with an increase\
    \ of more than $70 million and an \ninvestment of more than $400 million, among\
    \ other projects (Agronet, 2022). By March 2023, \nthis hub had conducted its\
    \ first business acceleration program and selected 25 companies across \nthree\
    \ topics: foodtech, agtech, and animaltech. \n \nInitiatives promoting networking\
    \ \nNetwork for Extension workers  \nThe Linkata is a network of extension workers\
    \ and technical assistants in Colombia. It \nwas created in 2012 by AGROSAVIA\
    \ and the Ministry of Agriculture. Linkata aims to hold a \nspace for interaction,\
    \ discussion, and participation of the sector's technical assistants and \nextension\
    \ workers, and to achieve and strengthen the service of technical advisory in\
    \ the benefit \nof small farmers. Currently, the community comprises forty-four\
    \ (44) groups that respond to the \nproductive chains of the Ministry of Agriculture\
    \ and Rural Development (Cruz and Perdomo, \n2019). Today, this network contains\
    \ more than 7.000 active members.  \n \n \n \n[62] \n \nCreating a professional\
    \ guild \nIn June 2019, a WhatsApp group called Agtech Colombia was created by\
    \ civil society \ngroups as a collaborative strategy for coordinating and implementing\
    \ actions to develop the \nAgriFoodTech ecosystem. In its description, the group\
    \ presents itself as an Agtech ecosystem \ngroup, home to representatives from\
    \ the private sector, public sector, multilateral entities, civil \nsociety, farmers,\
    \ associations, startups, media, financial and impact sectors, agribusiness \n\
    associations, agriculture and food, and academia. The group hosts three working\
    \ tables focusing \non governance, technology and competitiveness, fair trade,\
    \ and rural development. Since June \n2022, I have joined the WhatsaApp group\
    \ and have followed its evolution. By the end of March \n2023, 265 people —including\
    \ entrepreneurs, consultants, professionals, public servants, and a \nfew leaders\
    \ of farmers' organizations— were part of this group that shared news, relevant\
    \ \ninformation, and specific questions on products and services, such as where\
    \ to find drones or \nbuyers to commercialize avocado.  By March 2023, the group\
    \ promoted a series of virtual and \nin-person meetings among their members, mainly\
    \ those localized in Bogotá, Colombia´s capital, \naiming to position and consolidate\
    \ the Agtech Group “as an enabler for the use and \ndiversification of technology\
    \ in the Colombian rural areas, as a space for institutional influence \nwith\
    \ the aim of generating productive impact, food security, and economic development’\
    \ \n(Agtech Group, 2023, p6). The group plans an in-person event in July 2023\
    \ to boost the work \nbeing developed in the working tables, define communication\
    \ with the Bogota Secretary of \nEconomic Development, and formalize their work\
    \ as a professional guild with a strategic plan to \nguide their future actions.\
    \  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[63] \nCreating an annual space for gathering \nExpoAgrofuturo\
    \ is a fair that takes place in Medellín every year and is an event focused \n\
    on the agricultural sector, the most important for Colombia, and with projection\
    \ to Latin \nAmerica. This fair is \"the place where supply and demand meet in\
    \ all business segments and for \nall ecosystems of the sector\" (Expoagrofuturo,\
    \ 2023, para.2). For the past couple of years, \nExpoAgrofuturo has promoted conversation\
    \ and visibility of digital technologies in agriculture. \nSince 2022, the same\
    \ organizers have been promoting Agstar as a platform to foster connections \n\
    between different actors focused on integrating innovations in the agri-food sector.\
    \ In its \nactivities, Agstar holds start-up competition, a business roundtable,\

    \ companies. Thirty-five of these \nproducts and services (58% of 60) are related\
    \ to precision agriculture equipment and include a \nvariety of sensors, drons,\
    \ and satellite imagery. Twenty-four (40% of 60) are farm management \n \n[66]\
    \ \n \nplatforms that generally allow farmers to analyze information gathered\
    \ off-farm and on-farm \nusing different tools. Only one (0,1% of 60) is focused\
    \ on smart packaging.  \nDescriptions of precision agriculture equipment products\
    \ and services are not specific to \nthe targeted crop type. Some mentioned that\
    \ they had been tested and used on particular crops, \nincluding coffee, banana,\
    \ flowers, sugarcane, avocado, fruits, potatoes, grasses, citrus, and \ncannabis.\
    \    \nFarm management platforms vary in complexity and services offered. For\
    \ instance, \nSimpleAgri, a Colombian company, offers medium-sized farmers and\
    \ agroindustry services that \nenable the planning, scheduling, and execution\
    \ of agricultural production systems. It focuses on \ncosting, traceability, data\
    \ collection throughout crop growth phases, and production and harvest \nquality\
    \ management through recommendations from technical assistance visits to farms.\
    \ \nSiomaApp, a Colombian company, offers the banana industry a mobile app, which\
    \ is a precision \nagriculture ecosystem that can monitor the quality of georeferenced\
    \ fieldwork using \nphotographic records. Climate FieldView is a service provided\
    \ by Bayer that allows the \ncollection, transmission, and analysis of agronomic\
    \ data from all farm tasks. Galápp is a service \ndeveloped by a Colombian startup\
    \ aiming to facilitate small farmers’ capture of information on \nfarms, including\
    \ harvest, tasks, sanitary controls, input application, and sales; this app works\
    \ \nwithout the Internet and is designed for small and medium farmers.  \nThe\
    \ service focused on smart packaging is called Nukak and was developed by the\
    \ same \ncompany that launched SiomaApp. Nukak is a scale with an integrated control\
    \ system that \norganizes the exact boxes for export. According to their brochure,\
    \ using this digital product, an \nexporter can save $20,000 USD annually for\
    \ a 100-hectare farm by avoiding an excess weight of \n237 grams. Their main clients\
    \ were the banana and palm companies. \n \n \n \n[67] \n \nDigital Market Linkages\
    \ \nSixteen digital products and services offering a marketplace or e-commerce\
    \ platform \nwere identified. Ten (62% of 16) are digital marketplaces that bring\
    \ together multiple sellers to \noffer buyers a broader range of agricultural\
    \ products and services. The other six offer e-\ncommerce platforms focused on\
    \ direct sales from a single company that aggregates the \nproduction of small\
    \ and medium producers.  \nDigital marketplaces have two types of connections:\
    \ connecting farmers with input \nsellers and connecting farmers with buyers of\
    \ their produce. In the first case, some services are \nfree for buyers, while\
    \ others are initially free for sellers but later charge a commission for sales.\
    \ \nThe inputs for purchase are seeds, fertilizers, farm equipment, and animals\
    \ such as cows and \nhorses. In the second case, the business model can vary.\
    \ For example, SiembraCo employs an \napproach centered on virtual crop planting.\
    \ This enables customers to finance the virtual \nplanting of crops, and upon\
    \ harvest, they can consume the produce, donate it, or sell it on the \nsame platform.\
    \ On the other hand, Comproagro allows buyers to communicate and buy directly\
    \ \nfrom farmers their current produce.  \nE-commerce platforms also have specific\
    \ nuances. Two platforms seem more specialized: \nPetalii sells superior quality\
    \ floral products to national and international markets, and Mucho \nsells products\
    \ related to the sustainable use of biodiversity.  On the other hand, TuPlaza,\
    \ \nGuineo, and Frubana commercialize the production of small-scale producers\
    \ to urban centers, \nconnecting them with households, restaurants, and neighborhood\
    \ stores.   \nDigital Advisory & Extension \nThree digital products and services\
    \ offering farmers and technical assistants information \non weather forecasting,\
    \ pests and diseases, and market prices were identified. These products \nare\
    \ provided by public, private, and nonprofit actors using different types of technologies\
    \ to \nreach their users. \n \n[68] \n \nCenicafe, the research branch of the\
    \ National Federation of Coffee Growers5 (FNC), \nprovided Agroclima in 2011.\
    \ This web-based agroclimatic platform delivers open information \nrelated to\
    \ weather forecasting and identifies the most suitable months for coffee planting.\
    \ This \ninformation is shared daily and includes current and historical data.\
    \ This free service targets \ncoffee growers of all sizes and utilizes historical\
    \ data from the Cenicafe.  AGROSAVIA offers Dr \nAgro, a mobile application sharing\
    \ with extensionists workers, technical assistants, and farmers \ninformation\
    \ for identifying pests, diseases and nutritional deficiencies in potato, cotton,\
    \ tomato, \nmango, and rubber crops. It is based on scientific information reviewed\
    \ and curated by \nAGROSAVIA and can be used without internet access. \nAgrodatAI\
    \ offers Don Tulio, a free WhatsApp chatbot that provides farmers with data on\
    \ \nweather, prices, price forecasts, and best-selling prices for any product\
    \ or location. Farmers can \nsubmit written inquiries, and the bot retrieves responses\
    \ from public data. However, it remains \nunclear whether this information is\
    \ accurate or reliable.  \nDigital Financial Services \nEight digital products\
    \ and services offering some financial assistance to farmers were \nidentified.\
    \ These were created to facilitate farmers' access to financing through different\
    \ \noperational models. One model is crowdfunding, where farmers structure their\
    \ project and post \nit on the platform to look for micro-funding from other individuals;\
    \ this is the model of Agrapp \nand Agroune, which facilitates the exchange between\
    \ farmers and investors. Another model is \nthe direct offer of customized financing\
    \ services for farmers. For instance, Agricapital offers \ninvestments between\
    \ USD 1.000 and 5.000 for rural young and women without credit scores, \nbut with\
    \ productive projects running.  GrowBank provides a line of credit for agricultural\
    \ \n \n \n5 Created in 1927, National Federation of Coffee Growers is a non-profit\
    \ trade organization, \ninternationally well-known within the coffee world, in\
    \ charge of representing and defending the interests \nof Colombian coffee producers\
    \ at the national and international levels. \n \n[69] \n \nactivities after a\
    \ thorough risk evaluation. The last model is supplied by Produce Pay, which \n\
    offers funding up to 12 months before harvest and a marketplace to facilitate\
    \ the sale of the \nproduce.  \nAgRisk and IncluirTec offer financial companies\
    \ and insurers risk assessment services \ntailored to the needs of farmers, supporting\
    \ the emission of a rural loan within the offers of \nthese companies.  \nFinally,\
    \ the National Federation of Coffee Growers (FNC) developed Coffee Growers' \n\
    Smart ID, a service that offers access to banking services to coffee growers members\
    \ of the \nfederation. This product is a savings account with access to ATMs for\
    \ electronic payments that is \nalso used to channel government subsidies. \n\
    Supply chain management \nThe six identified digital products and services provide\
    \ platforms to support the \ninteractions of several actors in one or more value\
    \ chains. For example, Cultivando Futuro \naimed to align supply, demand, and\
    \ investment by creating Colombia's “largest supply \ncalendar.” They expect to\
    \ map what is being offered by farmers and what is being requested by \nconsumers\
    \ to generate data and provide access to details on how products are needed in\
    \ the \nmarket.  TraceCoffe, CoffeAgenda, and COLCO are value-chain-specific.\
    \ TraceCoffee, a \ntechnology company founded by Colombians in Silicon Valley,\
    \ offers traceability along the \ncoffee value chain using the Internet of Things\
    \ and blockchain to gather information at each \nproduction and commercialization\
    \ step. CoffeAgenda, founded in Colombia, provides registers \nand monitoring\
    \ for coffee during the productive process, post-harvest, and export.  COLCO:\
    \ The \nColombian Cocoa Control System, developed by the British Embassy in Colombia,\
    \ applies \nsatellite technologies to support the interaction between cacao farmers\
    \ and producers to \nimprove quality and yield in the pre-and post-harvest phases\
    \ of the cacao supply chain.  \n \n \n[70] \n \n3.5.3 What types of actors sell\
    \ them, and to whom? \n \nNational and international actors, including public,\
    \ private, social, and international \ncooperation entities, constitute the providers\
    \ of digital products and services for the agricultural \nsector in Colombia.\
    \  \nDigitized Farm Tools \nAll the companies in this category are private companies\
    \ of varied size, including, \nstartups, and medium and large companies. 56% of\
    \ providers are Colombian; the remaining \nproviders consist of international\
    \ startups and large companies originating from Chile, Israel, \nMexico, the United\
    \ States, Germany, and Brazil. The available descriptions do not explicitly \n\
    state whether the products are targeted at small-scale farmers; based on their\
    \ features, these \nproducts and services appear to be geared toward farmers with\
    \ larger land areas who require \nmonitoring and evaluation of their agricultural\
    \ processes more efficiently. \nDigital Market Linkages \nEight out of the ten\
    \ identified marketplaces services in this category are provided by \nnational\
    \ organizations, including startups and social companies; they are mainly located\
    \ in \nmajor cities; only three out of eight were founded by entrepreneurs in\
    \ departments such as \nCasanare, Boyacá, and Tolima, which are not very prominent\
    \ as others where the major capitals \nare located.  All have partnerships with\
    \ different actors, including business accelerators, media \noutlets, international\
    \ cooperation, large NGOs, universities, chambers of commerce and \ncompanies\
    \ selling agricultural inputs. The other two marketplaces are provided by international\
    \ \ncompanies, one from the United States (Agromovil with USAID and private foundations\
    \ as key \npartners) and one from Brazil (Orbia with solid partnerships with Bayer\
    \ and Yara). These \nmarketplaces seem oriented to all kinds of farmers who know\
    \ how to navigate these interactions \n \n[71] \n \nmediated through digital platforms\
    \ and are close enough to their potential buyers to sell the \nproduct in a profitable\
    \ way.  \nRegarding the six e-commerce platforms, headquarters are all in major\
    \ cities, and only \none is oriented to national and international markets.  All\
    \ seem oriented to small farmers. For \nexample, Petalli aggregates 50 small flower\
    \ producers; and Mucho sells the produce of different \nfarmers association. \
    \ \nDigital Advisory & Extension \nThe three primary technical assistance providers\
    \ are of national origin. Agroclima is \ndeveloped by Cenicafé, a research center\
    \ affiliated with the biggest coffee association of farmers. \nDr Agro is a product\
    \ of Agrosavia, a public organization. AgrodatAI is a spin-off created by two\
    \ \nprivate companies, one specializing in geographic information systems and\
    \ the other in project \ndesign for agricultural chains. They all seem to target\
    \ small and medium farmers with some \ninternet access. Dr Agro is the only one\
    \ available for use offline and focusing on technical \nassistants. \n \n Digital\
    \ Financial Services \nSeven of the eight financial services identified are provided\
    \ by national private \ncompanies, including startups. The other one (Produce\
    \ Pay) is a US-based startup with a \npresence in Canada, the United States, Mexico,\
    \ Colombia, Peru, and Chile.  \nSupply chain management \nApproximately half of\
    \ the services in this category originated from international sources. \nTwo of\
    \ them are associated with companies based in the United States, while the third\
    \ pertains \nto an initiative developed through international cooperation from\
    \ the United Kingdom. As for \nthe national services, they are headquartered in\
    \ various Colombian cities, including Bogotá, \n \n[72] \n \nJardin (Antioquia),\
    \ and Popayán (Cauca). In this instance, it is not explicitly stated that these\
    \ \nservices are targeted towards small-scale producers, but rather towards producers\
    \ in general. \n \n3.6 Discussion and Conclusions \n \nThis qualitative study\
    \ explored the configuration of digital agricultural products and \nservices available\
    \ in Colombia in 2022 and early 2023. The results showed that Colombia has an\
    \ \nemergent and varied range of digital products and services for different processes\
    \ required by \nproducers, such as on-farm activities, market connections, financial\
    \ services, supply chain \nmanagement, and digital technical assistance. However,\
    \ the distribution across these categories \nis uneven, with a higher prevalence\
    \ of products and services focused on on-farm activities (65% \nof the total),\
    \ followed by marketplaces and e-commerce platforms (17%), financial services\
    \ (9%), \nsupply chain management initiatives (6%), and, to a lesser extent, technical\
    \ assistance (3%). \nDifferent private and public actors are the providers of\
    \ these services, including startups and \nmedium and large companies. The use\
    \ of types of service allows a nuanced view of this \nconfiguration, evidencing\
    \ the different stages of advance and emphasis within them.   \nAlthough there\
    \ is a wide range of products within the category of digitized farm tools, \n\
    including precision agriculture tools, there is a noticeable dispersion in offerings\
    \ and a \nparticular emphasis on those producers who are already engaged in production\
    \ intensification \nactivities or have sufficient production volumes to invest\
    \ in these tools. Given the expected \noutcomes of using these technologies (table\
    \ 2), it can be suggested that if these benefits are \nrealized, such as increased\
    \ efficiency, reduced labor costs, and improved resource management, \nthey will\
    \ be concentrated among these types of producers, potentially widening the gap\
    \ with \nsmaller producers or those with less access to resources. This is coherent\
    \ with concerns being \npointed by Rotz et al., (2019) and Duncan et al., (2021)\
    \ who warn that these technologies can \ndeepen the gaps between farmers. \n \n\
    [73] \n \nAn important issue for future research concerning this type of service\
    \ is the lack of clarity \non the policies surrounding the use of localized information\
    \ by these technologies. The \ninformation provided on the websites of these organizations\
    \ does not clearly demonstrate a \nstance on how they manage individual farmer\
    \ data. This issue should be considered in future \nresearch since, as Schroeder\
    \ et al., (2021) mention, “laws addressing the ownership of data from \ndigital\
    \ agriculture are frequently either missing or inadequate.”  (p.5). In the case\
    \ of Colombia, \ndata ownership in the rural sector is still a highly uncertain\
    \ matter that needs to be further \naddressed to support and serve small farmers.\
    \ \nMarketplaces and e-commerce platforms coexist in the market linkages category,\
    \ each \npresenting different power dynamics. On the one hand, marketplaces promote\
    \ direct \ncommunication between buyers and sellers, yet this mainly benefits\
    \ farmers with better access \nto resources and a closer connection to digital\
    \ activities. The e-commerce model allows \norganizations to aggregate supply\
    \ and sell it, preventing producers from managing customer \ncontacts directly;\
    \ the e-commerce approach seems to better serve producers who are more \ndistant\
    \ from the market or have fewer resources since the company assumes inventory\
    \ and \npayment activities. However, it also highlights the need for better accountability\
    \ from platforms \noffering these services to ensure transparency in their marketing\
    \ processes. \nIn the financial services category, there was an interest in facilitating\
    \ access to financial \nservices for small producers. With a few exceptions, most\
    \ platforms are oriented towards \nserving small producers, who have less access\
    \ to credit and financing. Like the previous \ncategory, there are issues regarding\
    \ data management that require further exploration, \nparticularly on how each\
    \ of these companies manages the data collected from their users and \nhow this\
    \ data is or is not used to make other decisions regarding access to resources\
    \ or \nsubsidies. The experience of the National Federation of Coffee Growers\
    \ shows how a trade \norganization can develop a digital service to benefit its\
    \ members by facilitating both the \n \n[74] \n \npayment for coffee sales and\
    \ access to public resources. This case is possible due to the \nleadership and\
    \ significant role the Federation plays in the country. It is necessary to explore\
    \ \nunder what conditions other trade associations could also develop a financial\
    \ service like this in \npartnership. Based on the information available on the\
    \ websites of these organizations, it is \ndifficult to determine the geographic\
    \ coverage of these services. As the sector is primarily driven \nby startups,\
    \ it is challenging to establish the continuity of these services over time, which\
    \ \nresemble financial innovations aimed at accessing specific communities. Future\
    \ research should \nanalyze the success or failure of these startups and their\
    \ business models in achieving national \nreach with their operations. \nAlthough\
    \ the mapping of products offering digital advisory indicates just a few services,\
    \ \nthe review of initiatives promoting digital agriculture shows a significant\
    \ emphasis on digital \nextension, driven mainly by the public sector with the\
    \ national digital extension system and the \nopen information platforms being\
    \ generated by IDEAM and AGROSAVIA. The existence of the \nLinkata network reflects\
    \ that is a critical matter that counts with engaged actors but lacking a \nstrategy\
    \ combining this large number of actors in the Linkata network with the endeavors\
    \ \nlooking that digital technical assistance reaches a national scale in a coordinated\
    \ fashion. \nFinally, in supply chain management, the identified platforms are\
    \ still in a very early \nstage, and the question remains open as to what types\
    \ of actors will be able to access these \nservices, which are highly focused\
    \ on providing traceability and transparency throughout the \nchain. It is also\
    \ important to note that several of these platforms were oriented towards coffee\
    \ \nand cocoa, two very important crops for the country. On the one hand, coffee\
    \ is a historically \nsignificant crop for the country, in which Colombia is an\
    \ international reference. On the other \nhand, cocoa is considered the \"crop\
    \ of peace\" and has gained great relevance in the country \nfollowing the signing\
    \ of the peace agreement, as many post-conflict initiatives have been \ndedicated\
    \ to financing small producers for the establishment of cocoa crops. \n \n[75]\
    \ \n \nRegarding the inequality patterns proposed by Hackford, several comments\
    \ can be \nmade. First, the first pattern of inequality focused on inequalities\
    \ in control over technological \ndevelopment, particularly in the predominant\
    \ role of large agricultural and technology \ncorporations, does not seem to be\
    \ fulfilled in the Colombian context, given that the actors \ndriving the digital\
    \ agriculture ecosystem are varied, and there is high participation of startups\
    \ \nwith a wide network of allies to develop their operations. Second, regarding\
    \ the unequal \ndistribution of benefits pattern, it is mainly evident in the\
    \ category of digital tools for the farm, \nwhere innovations are primarily aimed\
    \ at benefiting larger producers or producers better \nconnected to the market.\
    \ Third, regarding the pattern of Uneven Sovereignty over Data and \nHardware,\
    \ it is an uncertain issue. The country is in a very early stage concerning the\
    \ \nmanagement of data generated by producers, and a deeper analysis of current\
    \ licensing \nagreements for the use of technologies, mainly focused on digital\
    \ extension or supply chain \nmanagement, is required. \nForth, in the pattern\
    \ of inequality in knowledge and skills, there is a clear lack of skills to \n\
    navigate the available information. For example, Doctor Agro, developed by Agrosavia,\
    \ is aimed \nat agricultural extension workers with a higher technical preparation\
    \ to navigate the \ninformation available on the platform. Finally, in the last\
    \ pattern on Unequal Problem \nDefinition and Problem-Solving Capacities, there\
    \ is a prioritization of solutions focused on \nincreasing efficiency and productivity.\
    \ In the products and services reviewed, no reference was \nfound to alternative\
    \ approaches such as agroecology or regenerative agriculture. Only in the 5-\n\
    year initiative driven by CIAT is there a concern for climate-smart practices.\
    \ \nThis study faced a relevant limitation. Many of these companies’ websites\
    \ lack specific \ndescriptions of their services, making it difficult to determine\
    \ if they are active. It is also \nchallenging to determine if the information\
    \ is up to date; tracking their social media does not \nalways yield recent updates\
    \ to understand if they are still in operation. While this presented a \n \n[76]\
    \ \n \nlimitation for this research, it also highlights how this sector operates;\
    \ startups create a \n\"minimum viable product\" which, in the case of advisory\
    \ & extension and market linkages \ncategories, may be simply a website describing\
    \ the service offerings. To overcome this challenge, \nfuture research must combine\
    \ other search techniques and information triangulation methods, \nwhich may be\
    \ more time-consuming and costly. \nThis study shows that Colombia has unique\
    \ characteristics in its digital agriculture \necosystem and, therefore, should\
    \ develop a research agenda that addresses them. It shows that, \nas indicated\
    \ by some scholars (Klerkx et al., 2019; McCampbell et al., 2022), it is urgent\
    \ to \ndeeply explore the particularities of each configuration of digital agricultural\
    \ technologies across \ndeveloping countries.  This understanding is essential\
    \ to build relevant research agendas that \nrespond to the country-level needs\
    \ —as has been done in other countries (e.g Bellon-Maurel et \nal., 2022 in France)—\
    \  but also to the issues that are more pressing in each country, for example\
    \ \nthe importance of digital financial services in reaching small-scale producers.\
    \ These nuanced \nand critical views can empower stakeholders within each country\
    \ to lead the type of \ndigitalization that is most needed in the agricultural\
    \ sector.   \n \n \n \n[77] \n \nChapter Four: The Promotors Of Digital Agricultural\
    \ \nTechnologies: What They Say About Its Promises, Perils, And \nImplications\
    \ For Small Farmers? \n \nIntroduction \nDigital agriculture is the application\
    \ of different types of digital technologies in the \nagriculture field and across\
    \ food systems. Known as Agriculture 4.0, e-agriculture, smart \nfarming and Agtech,\
    \ it conforms a broad sector promising to support global food systems, \nmaking\
    \ them efficient, profitable, and sustainable (Schroeder et al., 2021). The implementation\
    \ \nof this wide repertoire of hardware, software, and platforms (e.g sensors,\
    \ drones, robots, \nblockchain, cryptocurrencies, internet of things, artificial\
    \ intelligence, and the subsequent \namount of data generated) is intended to\
    \ change how farmers manage people, processes, \nanimals and land; how producers,\
    \ middlemen, traders and consumers relate among them; and \nhow decisions on production\
    \ and commercialization are made (Klerkx et al., 2019; Trendov et \nal., 2019).\
    \  \nOur understanding of how this emergent sector is evolving is still fragmented\
    \ and biased \nto what is happening in developed regions such as the United States,\
    \ New Zealand, Australia, \nand Europe (McCampbell et al., 2022; Hackfort, 2021).\
    \ Understanding how digital agriculture \ndevelops in developing countries and\
    \ what the perspectives of key stakeholders are essential to \ndiscern what is\
    \ common and specific in the development of these technologies worldwide. In \n\
    sum, these diverse views will reveal the different types and trajectories of digital\
    \ agriculture. \nThis qualitative study explores Colombian promoters' perspectives\
    \ on the dynamic of \ndigital agricultural technologies, their opportunities,\
    \ complexities, and unforeseen impacts, \nparticularly for small farmers. The\
    \ questions guiding this exploratory study are i) How do they \nenvision digital\
    \ agricultural technologies' role in Colombia? ii) How do they understand the\
    \ \ncomplexities and uncertainties of these technologies' deployment in the country?\
    \ iii) How are \n \n[78] \n \nthey considering the unforeseen impacts of these\
    \ technologies? Answers to these questions offer \ninsights to inform a conversation\
    \ on how digital agricultural technologies are being designed, \ndeveloped, and\
    \ deployed and the potential trajectories of these technologies in the country.\
    \ This \nstudy aims to contribute to the scholarship on the social implications\
    \ of digital agriculture; \nexploring the views of promoters and entrepreneurs\
    \ in Colombia, a population that has not been \nstudied, offers a window to comprehend\
    \ what is the situation in the country. \nI am using a qualitative inquiry for\
    \ two reasons. First, this approach directly explores \nnarratives by digital\
    \ agriculture promoters working in Colombia by identifying their \nperceptions,\
    \ assumptions, motivations, and explicit objectives. Considering the lack of \n\
    information available, semi-structured interviews enable the collection of details\
    \ on the \nrationale behind these endeavors and elicit a response concerning the\
    \ implications of their \ntechnologies. Second, this is a unique population within\
    \ the spectrum of actors promoting and \ndeveloping these technologies.  \nThis\
    \ paper continues to present the background and methods. Then I present the \n\
    findings and discuss how aspects highlighted by the interviewees relate to the\
    \ literature on \nnarratives on digital agriculture and their expected outcomes.\
    \ \n \n4.2 Background \nNarratives on digital agricultural technologies   \nThe\
    \ mainstream narrative surrounding digital technologies in agriculture is \npredominantly\
    \ optimistic and technical, emphasizing the potential to address the global \n\
    challenge of feeding the world as the population is projected to increase by 2\
    \ billion by 2050 \n(Lajoie-O’Malley et al., 2020). Digitalization is often portrayed\
    \ as a solution to address global \n \n[79] \n \nfood shortages, enhancing yields\
    \ and incomes and reducing detrimental inputs (Mohr & Höhler, \n2023; Ancín et\
    \ al.,2022).  \nHowever, this view on digital technologies is not the only one.\
    \ In an analysis of social \nmedia and public websites, Glaros et al., (2023)\
    \ identified three framings underpinning digital \nagri-food system transformations,\
    \ namely Productivity through Precision (PtP), Enhancing \nFarmers’ Rights through\
    \ Technological Sovereignty (TS), and Traceability through Tech-Enabled \nDisruption\
    \ (TTD). These three framings illustrate the different approaches that different\
    \ actors \ncan have over the same matter. \nIn the PtP, digital technologies are\
    \ crucial in improving predictability and control at the \nfarm level, ultimately\
    \ contributing to higher global yields and sustainable profits for farmers. By\
    \ \nleveraging digital data, farmers can refine their decision-making process,\
    \ which can either \ncomplement or replace their intuition for determining optimal\
    \ practices. This viewpoint \nunderlines the need for individual farmers to embrace\
    \ digital technologies to maximize yields and \nprofits. \nThe TS framing highlights\
    \ the potential challenges digital technologies pose to farmer \nautonomy while\
    \ emphasizing the need for these tools to address diverse farmer needs and support\
    \ \nagroecological practices. It focuses on the importance of governance structures,\
    \ open and \nparticipatory processes in technology development, and sharing, to\
    \ ensure equitable benefits \ndistribution. By placing farmers and farming communities\
    \ at the center of digital agri-food system \ntransformation, this framing foster\
    \ farmer autonomy, community organization, and legislative \nchange, considering\
    \ the needs of both individual farmers and farmer collectives. \nFinally, the\
    \ TTD framing aims to enhance supply chain transparency, improve market \nefficiencies,\
    \ and meet evolving consumer demands. Industry news outlets and think tanks \n\
    highlight the system-wide benefits of adopting digital technologies for transforming\
    \ local and \nglobal supply chains. Technologies like blockchain and e-commerce\
    \ platforms are emphasized in \n \n[80] \n \ndigital agri-food system transformation\
    \ discussions. These digital solutions refine information \ndelivery across value\
    \ chains, enabling quick responses to disease and food fraud concerns, \noptimizing\
    \ farmers' operations in real-time, and granting consumers access to quality and\
    \ safe \nfood information.  \n \nImplications of digital agricultural technologies\

    \ \n \n[ 81 ] \ns\n \n \n[82] \n \n \nColombian digital agriculture  \nColombia\
    \ has an emergent ensemble of actors, public and private initiatives, and digital\
    \ \nproducts and services promoting digital agriculture. An exploratory review\
    \ found 93 products and \nservices currently available (see chapter three). The\
    \ current offer in Colombia is skewed toward \ndigitized farm tools (65%), including\
    \ sensors, drones, satellite imagery, and farm management \nplatforms. Other services\
    \ offering digital products are market linkages —e-commerce and \nmarketplaces—\
    \ (17%), financial services (9%) providing access to financing, supply chain \n\
    management (6%), and digital advisory and extension (3%).   \nInitiatives promoting\
    \ digital agriculture are diverse. They include the pilot of a public \nprogram\
    \ to deliver digital extension service across the country using WhatsApp, information\
    \ \nservices on weather forecasts, satellite images, and early warning alerts,\
    \ the inclusion of \ntechnologies as enablers for the rural sector in the National\
    \ Development Plan proposed for \n2022-2026, a 5-year and US$99,9 million project\
    \ including digital technologies to reduce the \nvulnerability of agricultural\
    \ production to climate threats, networks of extensionist workers, \nentrepreneurs\
    \ and a regional agrifood tech innovation hub recently launched.  \nDespite the\
    \ variety of initiatives and the numerous actors working in this sector, the \n\
    country still lacks a common vision regarding the future direction of digital\
    \ agriculture, the \nchallenges it poses for the nation and aspects that must\
    \ be considered to ensure that digital \nagriculture benefits the various groups\
    \ of producers present in Colombia. A common vision \nwould trace a common goal\
    \ —equity along agrifood systems, environmental sustainability, food \nsecurity,\
    \ and climate change adaptation— and encourage collaboration among different \n\
    stakeholders, enabling a better allocation of resources supporting research, innovation\
    \ and \ndissemination of technologies. This exploratory study provides empirical\
    \ evidence to advance in \nthat direction. \n \n \n \n \n[83] \n \n \n4.3 Methods\
    \ \nThis exploratory study examines the narratives of Colombian entrepreneurs\
    \ and \npromoters on opportunities, complexities, and unforeseen impacts that\
    \ digital agricultural \ntechnologies pose for small farmers. Specifically, it\
    \ analyzes i) views on the role technology can \nplay, ii) perceptions on complexities\
    \ and uncertainties of technology deployment, iii) \nunderstandings of unforeseen\
    \ impacts that technologies can have on small farmers.   \nI used a qualitative\
    \ inquiry approach and conducted semi-structured interviews \n(Creswell & Poth,\
    \ 2018) to explore perceptions, assumptions, motivations, explicit \nunderstandings,\
    \ and objectives of digital agriculture promoters in Colombia. In this research,\
    \ an \nentrepreneur is defined as someone who leads on a full-time basis, a commercial\
    \ initiative —\nstartup, organization, or project—developing and deploying a specific\
    \ digital agricultural \ntechnology through the rationale of a business model.\
    \ A promoter is a person or an organization \ncontributing to the expansion of\
    \ digital technologies by supporting or funding entrepreneurs, \noffering advocacy,\
    \ developing knowledge, or unfolding initiatives to increase the use of these\
    \ \ntechnologies in the agricultural sector. Due to the scope of this study, I\
    \ only interviewed \nentrepreneurs and promoters with operations in Colombia.\
    \  \nWithin the scholarship addressing digital agricultural technologies from\
    \ a social \nstandpoint, there is an interest in hearing the voices of actors\
    \ participating in this field. In the \nNorth American context, Bronson (2019)\
    \ conducted 22 unstructured interviews with designers \nof smart farming technologies\
    \ to identify the values at the core of their practice; Carolan (2017) \nand Duncan\
    \ (2018) conducted in-depth interviews (18 and 33, respectively) with North \n\
    American farmers and retailers to understand farmers’ perspectives on socio-technical\
    \ changes \nderived from these technologies. In Europe, Van der Burg et al., (2022)\
    \ conducted 33 semi-\nstructured interviews with experts on A.I. robots for agri-food\
    \ on their views on the values, \nethical questions, and conflicts perceived.\
    \ There is an evident absence of views from Latin \n \n \n[84] \n \n \nAmerican\
    \ entrepreneurs and promoters. This study contributes to this field by echoing\
    \ these \nvoices and perceptions. \n \nData collection  \nI used two strategies\
    \ to identify people working in this sector. First, a desktop search \nlooking\
    \ into reports, news, and related events in Latin America; this process helped\
    \ me \nunderstand the scope, size, and characteristics of this sector and to identify\
    \ relevant actors. \nSecond, I used a snowball strategy, starting with professional\
    \ contacts working on projects \nfocused on the development of rural areas. As\
    \ an outcome of both approaches, I created a list of \nthirty potential interviewees\
    \ that were sampled purposefully looking for promoters and \nentrepreneurs actively\
    \ working in the sector. Specifically, I aimed to interview entrepreneurs \nwith\
    \ technologies in pilot phases or already in the market. For promoters, I selected\
    \ those \nworking actively to expand this sector. I sent direct emails to thirty\
    \ and have a response from \ntwenty-one.  \nConsidering their leadership and board-level\
    \ positions within their organizations, these \nactors can be considered elite\
    \ interviews (Harvey, 2011). Elite interviewing is “the use of \ninterviews to\
    \ study those at the ‘top’ of any stratification system” (Jupp, 2006). Schedule\
    \ these \ninterviews was challenging, because these actors have busy schedules,\
    \ and they don’t prioritize \ntalking to unknown or previously unfamiliar researchers.\
    \ I had to be persistent and use my \nnetworks to access to this person. Also,\
    \ I had to find the most appropriate way to get to their \ninbox and transmit\
    \ the objectives and relevance of this research. Finally, I spoke with co-\nfounders,\
    \ managers, and directors, all of whom identified themselves as experts in their\
    \ \nrespective fields. In some cases, certain interviewees extensively discussed\
    \ their backgrounds \nand career paths, which had an impact on the duration of\
    \ the interview. The interviews typically \n \n \n[85] \n \n \nlasted between\
    \ 45 and 60 minutes, but when such descriptions arose, the length extended to\
    \ 90 \nto 120 minutes. \nI conducted twenty-three semi-structured interviews with\
    \ entrepreneurs and promoters \nof digital agricultural technologies based in\
    \ Colombia between March 2021 and March 2023. \nTable 8 presents a summary of\
    \ the interviewees. The interviews were in Spanish —the \nresearcher’s and interviewees’\
    \ mother tongue. Two in-person interviews were conducted, and \nthe rest were\
    \ through virtual channels.   \nThe interview protocol fostered a conversation\
    \ around five open-ended topics: i) \nactivities developed in the sector; ii)\
    \ characteristics of technology being unfolded or promoted, \niii) opinion on\
    \ the relevance of digital technologies for agriculture in Latin America, iv)\
    \ vision of \ndigital technologies’ future, vision of unintended consequences,\
    \ and v) perceptions on ideas \nposed by responsible innovation frameworks. I\
    \ included a question on the responsible \ninnovation framework and its four dimensions\
    \ —anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and \nresponsiveness— since this has been\
    \ suggested by some scholars as a way to foresee potential \nimpacts and shape\
    \ the trajectories of digital agricultural technologies (Rose and Chilvers, 2018;\
    \ \nEastwood et al., 2019; Bronson, 2019). This ample approach has roots in different\
    \ research \ntraditions, including innovation studies, science, technology and\
    \ society studies, ethics and \ngovernance and regulation studies (Koops, 2015).\
    \ Responsible innovation can be defined as ‘a \nnew approach towards innovation,\
    \ in which social and ethical aspects are explicitly taken into \naccount (…)\
    \ and economic, socio-cultural and environmental aspects are balanced’ (Blok &\
    \ \nLemmens, 2015: 20).  \nData analysis \nI transcribed verbatim the recordings\
    \ of the interviews and coded them inductively and \ndeductively. First, I read\
    \ each interview and start an open coding, allowing themes and \ncategories to\
    \ emerge from the data itself. Later, I did deductive coding, using as a lens\
    \ my sub \n \n \n[86] \n \n \nquestions —views on the role technology can play,\
    \ perceptions of complexities and uncertainties \nof technology deployment, and\
    \ understandings of unforeseen impacts that technologies can \nhave on small farmers.\
    \  I analyzed each transcript and created descriptive labels for each topic. I\
    \ \norganized all the themes under the structure of my sub questions.    \n \n\
    Positionality  \n \nThe impetus behind this study stems from my positionality\
    \ as an engaged researcher, \nwhich has shaped the design, analysis, and interpretation\
    \ of the findings. My academic \nbackground encompasses a synthesis of business\
    \ management and social sciences, while my \nprofessional trajectory encompasses\
    \ entrepreneurial endeavours and consulting engagements \nwith large companies\
    \ and private social organizations. This amalgamation of theoretical training\
    \ \nand practical experience has fostered a pragmatist perspective (Creswell and\
    \ Poth, 2016) that \nprioritizes the practical implications of my research. It\
    \ also has provided me with access to a \nnetwork of people in leadership positions\
    \ working in agriculture and in market access for \nfarmers. This network was\
    \ crucial and opened the possibility to develop elite interviews. \n \n \n \n\

    \ \n \n[88] \n \n \n4.4 Findings \nThis qualitative research shed light on Colombian\
    \ promoters' perceptions of \ndigital agricultural technologies' opportunities,\
    \ complexities, and unforeseen impacts on \nsmall farmers.  \n \n4.4.1 Views on\
    \ the role technology can play. \nSimple and sophisticated technologies are included\
    \ in digital agriculture. \nThe interviewees shared a view that within digital\
    \ agriculture there are many \ntechnologies varying in complexity. It includes\
    \ less advanced or sophisticated \ntechnologies, such as Whatsapp and messages\
    \ delivered through cellphones, sensors, \ndrones, and tools to analyze soil health,\
    \ weather, humidity, cloud computation, \naugmented reality, artificial intelligence,\
    \ blockchain, and exponential technologies, \namong others. Two promoters from\
    \ an International Research Center offered a structure \nto analyze these technologies;\
    \ for them, a salient aspect of these technologies is that are \nuseful for collecting,\
    \ analyzing and disseminate information. In this sense, all tools \nsupporting\
    \ these aspects, regarding their degree of complexity can be included.  In the\
    \ \ncollecting phase, there are active and passive ways for data collection. Active\
    \ ways \ninclude the direct collection of farm information through tools such\
    \ as apps, google \nforms or ODK forms. Passive ways include data collected by\
    \ remote and non-remote \nsensors, capturing different types of farm information.\
    \ In the phase of analysis, there are \nalso a variety and degrees of sophistication,\
    \ ranging from descriptive statistics to data \nanalytics, big data, machine learning\
    \ and artificial intelligence. Finally, in the phase of \ndissemination, they\
    \ include all means useful for dissemination, including radio, email, \nweb platforms,\
    \ applications and text messages. \n \n \n[89] \n \n \nAs summarized by one of\
    \ these promoters from an International Research \nCenter: \nOriginal – “Uno puede\
    \ decir que todas las herramientas con sus distintas \nvariedades de complejidad,\
    \ que puedan colectar, analizar y diseminar, \nentrarían dentro de esto, desde\
    \ lo menos sofisticado hasta lo más \nsofisticado” .  P12 \nAuthor translation\
    \ – “One could say that all tools, with their different \nvarieties of complexity,\
    \ that can collect, analyze, and disseminate data, \nwould fall under this category,\
    \ ranging from the least sophisticated to the \nmost sophisticated.” \n  \nAlthough\
    \ some actors focused mainly on on-farm technologies, others stressed \nthat digital\
    \ technologies could serve many purposes along value chains, beyond the farm.\
    \  \n \nThe main benefits revolve around efficiency and productivity.   \nFive\
    \ main themes were common to the interviewees when considering the \nbenefits\
    \ provided using digital technologies —efficiency, productivity, access to \n\
    information to support decision-making, monitoring and traceability, and access\
    \ to \nmarkets. Many explained a causal chain linking these benefits with an increase\
    \ in \nincome. For example, the Manager of the funding operations of the agricultural\
    \ portfolio \nfor a European Cooperation Program in Colombia, illustrated in this\
    \ way: \nOriginal – “Con estos datos que se están dando un productor puede lograr\
    \ \nmejorar su rendimiento, abrir mercado y de esta manera mejorar lo que \nllega\
    \ a su casa en términos de ingreso” P3 \nAuthor translation – “With this data\
    \ that is being provided, a producer \ncan improve their yield, open up new markets,\
    \ and in this way, improve \nwhat comes to their home in terms of income.” \n\
    \ \n \n \n[90] \n \n \nIn the case of traceability, it is presented by many as\
    \ something requested and \nappreciated by the buyers and final clients, and as\
    \ an enabler to enter new markets. \nExamples include coffee growers being able\
    \ to share the stories behind the product, \nwhere and when was harvested, and\
    \ by whom, which are appreciated by international \nand specialized customers.\
    \  Others stressed that traceability also is useful for farmers to \novercome\
    \ information asymmetry. An entrepreneur selling blockchain-based technology \n\
    to ensure traceability in the coffee sector (E2) indicated that he created this\
    \ digital \nservice because he realized that “farmers are not connected as an\
    \ equal stakeholder (…) \nthey are not receiving the same information that big\
    \ coffee is using”. He argues “with our \nplatform, they're connected as equal\
    \ stakeholders”. For another entrepreneur, the \nfounder of a marketplace, access\
    \ to information is the first crucial step because it enables \nfarmers to establish\
    \ a direct interaction with actors with whom they would traditionally \nonly have\
    \ a mediated relationship through intermediaries.  \nOriginal – “Lo primero es\
    \ que (el productor) encuentre información, que \nparece muy básico, pero no tienen\
    \ información. Entonces, al encontrar \ninformación, encontrar los proveedores,\
    \ poderse contactar directamente \ncon ellos, hacer las solicitudes de cotización\
    \ directamente con los \nproveedores, pues yo creo que es el primer paso que le\
    \ genera valor” E7 \nAuthor translation –“The first thing is (for the producer)\
    \ to find \ninformation, which seems very basic, but they don't have information.\
    \ \nSo, by finding information, finding suppliers, being able to contact them\
    \ \ndirectly, and making requests for quotations directly with the suppliers,\
    \ \nI think that is the first step that generates value for them”. \n \nNone of\
    \ the interviewees offered data or empirical evidence to illustrate how \nthese\
    \ benefits operate in particular settings, crops, regions, or type of farmers.\
    \  \n  \n \n \n \n[91] \n \n \n4.4.2 Perceptions of the current situation of Digital\
    \ Agriculture in \nColombia \nThe sector is emerging and lacking coordination\
    \ \nThere is a common understanding that the digital agriculture sector in Colombia\
    \ \nis emergent. Despite the various initiatives and pilot projects developed\
    \ by public \nentities, private companies, international cooperation organizations,\
    \ and research \ncenters, participants indicate that there is a lack of concerted\
    \ action or communication \namong the companies and different actors promoting\
    \ the sector. Another participant \nmore acutely indicated that “there is no such\
    \ thing as a digital agriculture ecosystem in \nColombia.” \nIn addition to the\
    \ lack of coordination among the actors in the digital agriculture \nsystem, a\
    \ lack of communication between public actors focusing on information \ntechnologies\
    \ and those specializing in rural development was mentioned, as they seem to \n\
    have different conversations but with a great opportunity for convergence. \n\
    A senior researcher from a national research center focused on agriculture noted\
    \ \nthat significant steps are being taken from the research side, as technology\
    \ development \nand experiments are being carried out that allow the scientific\
    \ offering of digital \nagriculture to be materialized for different sectors.\
    \ Other promoters highlighted the work \nthat has been done by the public sector\
    \ to provide open information that is available for \nothers to develop digital\
    \ products and services, including databases on climate and \nworkspaces for articulation\
    \ among actors such as the agroclimatic tables; these tables \nbring together\
    \ farmers, researchers, extensionists, representatives of government \nentities,\
    \ non-governmental organizations, and other relevant actors in the agricultural\
    \ \nsector, allowing them to exchange information and knowledge about climate\
    \ and its \ninfluence on agricultural production. \n \n \n[92] \n \n \n \nA need\
    \ for improving technical skills and knowledge about rurality. \nThere are diverse\
    \ perspectives on the lack of technical skills or knowledge about \nrural areas.\
    \ On the one hand, some promoters highlighted the lack of analytical skills \n\
    among agricultural engineers and technicians, who are not being trained in universities\
    \ \nto perform data analytics using, for example, flexible programming languages\
    \ like R, \nPython, or PHP. With this deficiency, their role in supporting the\
    \ interpretation of data \nfor decision-making becomes very limited. On the other\
    \ hand, there is a lack of \nintegration between technological and agricultural\
    \ knowledge. An entrepreneur stated \nthat although there are experts in data\
    \ science and experts in agriculture, there are no \nindividuals who have knowledge\
    \ of both topics leading to inadequate analysis of \nagricultural information.\
    \ As stated by one entrepreneur, \nOriginal – “Yo diría que hay un problemita\
    \ ahí escondidito, y es que \nmucha gente llegó a agricultura digital, pero nunca\
    \ estuvo con lo \nanterior. Entonces, no solo en el manejo, sino en la interpretación\
    \ de las \ncosas. Hay mucho mal manejo de la información, terriblemente malo.”\
    \ \nE8 \nAuthor translation – “I would say that there is a little problem hidden\
    \ \nthere, and it is that many people came to digital agriculture, but they were\
    \ \nnever involved in the previous practices. So, not only in the management \n\
    but also in the interpretation of things. There is a lot of mishandling of \n\
    information, terribly bad.” \n \nIn the same vein, a promoter pointed out that\
    \ one of the characteristics of the \nsector is that many of the technological\
    \ solutions are being designed by technology \ndevelopment companies in a top-down\
    \ approach without considering the farmers who \nwill ultimately be the users,\
    \ their needs, and their conditions of use and access to the \ntechnology. \n\
    \ \n \n[93] \n \n \n \n Large associations are crucial but their role is contested\
    \     \nNearly half of the interviewees highlighted the importance of guilds and\
    \ how \nsectors such as coffee, rice, cereal, legumes, sugar cane, and oil palm\
    \ are in a better \nposition for the development and implementation of digital\
    \ agriculture technologies. On \nthe one hand, it was noted that these guilds\
    \ have a higher level of organization, which \nallows them to develop efforts\
    \ more cohesively with research centers, cooperation \nentities, and the public\
    \ sector. On the other hand, these guilds have large-scale \nproducers who, having\
    \ large extensions, have the need and vision to use these \ntechnologies to optimize\
    \ their activities in the field. \nHowever, other interviewees do not share such\
    \ a positive vision of guilds as \nfarmers' associations and federations. Two\
    \ entrepreneurs noted that farmers \norganizations like associations and federations\
    \ are managed politically. In the case of \nassociations, one entrepreneur stated\
    \ that they are managed by a small number of \npeople, sometimes from the same\
    \ family, as an exercise of power over resources. In the \ncase of federations,\
    \ another entrepreneur indicated that they have become marketers of \nproducts\
    \ and inputs but are not bringing technological advances to their members or \n\
    promoting technological development. Instead, they become an obstacle to the \n\
    articulation between technological entrepreneurs, technology providers, and farmers.\
    \ \n \n4.4.3 Perceptions of complexities and uncertainties of technology \ndeployment\
    \ in rural Colombia \nUpon investigating the particularities of the Colombian\
    \ context that contribute to \nthe complexity of the digital agriculture sector,\
    \ the interviewees highlighted factors \n \n \n[94] \n \n \nrelated to both the\
    \ institutional support structure for the agricultural industry and the \ninfrastructure\
    \ characteristics, as well as the intrinsic features of the producers \nthemselves.\
    \ \nA weak technical assistance system \nEntrepreneurs and promoters concurred\
    \ that the country possesses a rather frail \ntechnical assistance system. It\
    \ is noted that the existing agricultural technicians are \ninsufficient to meet\
    \ the farmers' needs, due to the limited number of technicians \navailable, the\
    \ geographic dispersion of the country's producers, and the characteristics of\
    \ \nthe access routes to the farms. Others indicate that a problematic issue with\
    \ technical \nassistance is its close association with “casas comerciales” —commercial\
    \ establishments \nselling agricultural inputs. This relationship creates a situation\
    \ in which the advice \nprovided by technical assistance is not entirely autonomous\
    \ but is instead influenced by \nthe sales requirements of these commercial establishments.\
    \ \n \nLack of digital infrastructure \nAll interviewees mentioned the barriers\
    \ to accessing technology that exists in the \ncountry. On one hand, there are\
    \ challenges in accessing the internet in various parts of \nthe country, which\
    \ limits the implementation of many of these technologies. On the \nother hand,\
    \ this situation compels technology promoters to adjust their products and \n\
    services so that they function offline or in accordance with connectivity limitations.\
    \ \nFurthermore, there is a discussion about the deficiencies in the ownership\
    \ of \ntechnological devices, such as smartphones. Many of the producers in Colombia\
    \ only \npossess low-end mobile phones (commonly referred to as “Teléfonos flecha”\
    \ —feature \nphones), which have limited memory and constrain the possibility\
    \ of interacting with \n \n \n[95] \n \n \nmore sophisticated applications that\
    \ are entirely online or require substantial storage \nspace on the phones. \n\
    \ \nLack of education and risk aversion in small farmers  \nThe majority of entrepreneurs\
    \ pointed out that the educational backgrounds of \nsmall-scale producers limit\
    \ their access to and engagement with technology. First, their \nlow level of\
    \ schooling was mentioned; most possess the ability to read and write at a very\
    \ \nbasic level, if at all. Second, the lack of technical education was highlighted,\
    \ as evidenced \nby their unfamiliarity with soil fertility conditions and the\
    \ behavior of pests or diseases, \nwhich impacts their productivity. Third, four\
    \ of the interviewees indicated that the \nproducers have a high aversion to change,\
    \ and therefore resist trying new technologies. \nAccording to one entrepreneur,\
    \ these characteristics explain why agribusinesses manage \nto utilize digital\
    \ technologies while small-scale producers do not.   \nOriginal – “Todo lo que\
    \ no sea agroindustria es un sector muy atrasado \npor múltiples factores. Uno,\
    \ por temas de escolaridad, el hecho de que \nno sepas escribir y leer, pues no\
    \ te permite hacer uso de esta tecnología. \nDos, porque no hay educación de Buenas\
    \ Prácticas Agrícolas (BPAs), si \ntú tampoco sabes BPAS nada haces con estas\
    \ plataformas. Estas \nplataformas están diseñadas para que tú, montes BPAs, por\
    \ lo tanto, sigas \nese plan de acción si tú no tienes una educación técnica de\
    \ cultivo \ntampoco haces nada. Tres, si no tienes una educación de costos \n\
    financiera no haces nada; y cuarto, el manejo de tecnologías hoy en día \ntodo\
    \ el mundo cree que la tecnología es un WhatsApp y la tecnología no \nes solo\
    \ un WhatsApp.” E8 \nAuthor translation – “Everything that is not agribusiness\
    \ is a very \nbackward sector due to multiple factors. One, is education issues;\
    \ the fact \nthat you don't know how to read and write, does not allow you to\
    \ make \nuse of this technology. Two, there is no education on Good Agricultural\
    \ \nPractices (GAPs); and if you don't know GAPs, you won't be able to do \nanything\
    \ with these platforms. These platforms are designed for you to \nimplement GAPs,\
    \ therefore, you must follow a plan of action, and if you \ndon't have technical\
    \ education on cultivation, you won't be able to do \nanything. Three, if you\
    \ don't have financial education on costs, you won't \n \n \n[96] \n \n \nbe able\
    \ to do anything; and fourth, the management of technologies \nnowadays, everyone\
    \ believes that technology is WhatsApp, and \ntechnology is not just WhatsApp.”\
    \ \n \nA combination of problems: low productivity, high costs, generational gaps,\
    \ \nmiddlemen \nAll interviewees pointed out various interrelated factors that\
    \ describe the \nstructural problems affecting small-scale farmers, who, on average,\
    \ own one or two \nhectares of land. These issues include low productivity, lack\
    \ of technical knowledge, high \ninput costs, youth migration from rural to urban\
    \ areas, the absence of an agricultural \npolicy with an agri-food system focus,\
    \ and intermediaries who dictate the terms of \nexchange. All these factors interact\
    \ and amplify each other, leading to significant \ndisparities between various\
    \ producer groups and considerable complexities and \nchallenges when developing\
    \ digital products and services. For many of the interviewees, \nthis combination\
    \ of problems represents the primary obstacle to the development of \ndigital\
    \ agriculture in the country.  As described by the Founder of a small innovation\
    \ lab \nfocused on rural sector,  \nOriginal – “No hay un proceso de productividad\
    \ alta, porque se crean \nsofismas idea de lo que es bueno en la tierra, claro,\
    \ hay unos \nconocimientos técnicos, campesinos, indígenas tradicionales, muy\
    \ \npositivos, pero también la naturaleza del país, la violencia, desarraigo,\
    \ \nlos bajos precios, el alto costo de los insumos, la alta intermediación, los\
    \ \naltos circuitos, los malos precios de compra hacen que el producto se \nencarezca\
    \ que no sea competitivo.” E3 \nAuthor translation –“There is no process of high\
    \ productivity, as \nmisconceptions arise concerning what is beneficial for the\
    \ land. Of \ncourse, there are positive traditional technical, peasant, and indigenous\
    \ \nknowledge systems, but the country's nature, violence, uprooting, low \nprices,\
    \ high input costs, significant intermediation, extensive circuits, \nand poor\
    \ purchase prices all contribute to an increase in product costs, \nrendering\
    \ them non-competitive.”  \n   \n \n \n[97] \n \n \n \n4.4.3     Understandings\
    \ of unforeseen impacts that technologies can \nhave \nThe perspectives on the\
    \ unanticipated consequences of technology in Colombia \nwere diverse among the\
    \ interviewees. Three distinct outlooks were identified: technology \nas neutral,\
    \ no discernible impacts yet, and the consideration of multifarious \nimplications.\
    \ \nTechnology is neutral \nA promoter from the public sector highlighted that\
    \ negative implications arose \nfrom the manner in which technology was utilized,\
    \ as the technology itself was neutral. \nIn their words,  \nOriginal – “Yo diría\
    \ que las tecnologías todas per se son buenas, es el \nuso que se le dé a esas\
    \ tecnologías las que pueden causar problemas.” E3 \nAuthor translation — “I would\
    \ argue that all technologies, per se, are \ninherently beneficial; it is the\
    \ application of these technologies that can \npotentially lead to problems.”\
    \ \n \nIn a related context, albeit from a distinct perspective, a promoter asserted\
    \ that \ntechnology embodies a black box, possessing the potential for both beneficial\
    \ and \ndetrimental applications. \nNo impacts yet  \nFour promoters and one entrepreneur\
    \ conveyed that they did not discern any \nunfavorable impacts arising from the\
    \ utilization of technology. The promoters noted that \nthey might potentially\
    \ recognize such implications during the implementation of their \npilot projects\
    \ or as these initiatives underwent scaling up. \n \n \n[98] \n \n \n \nMultifarious\
    \ implications    \nThe remaining promoters and entrepreneurs acknowledged one\
    \ or more facets \nthat could give rise to undesirable consequences. Among these\
    \ are the monopoly on \naccess to information, issues related to data ownership\
    \ and privacy, the loss of \nknowledge on the part of producers, and asymmetry\
    \ in the capacity for action among \ndifferent groups of producers. \nMonopoly\
    \ on data or access: Numerous promoters mentioned that the \nprimary concern is\
    \ the possibility that certain actors could exercise a monopoly on \ninformation\
    \ or access to technology. This concentration of information or supply would \n\
    result in small producers being unable to reap the benefits, as the prevailing\
    \ intention \nwould be to \"conduct business at the expense of the producers.\"\
    \ \nData privacy and ownership: Promoters from the private sector and \ninternational\
    \ cooperation emphasized the importance of data and the current lack of \nawareness\
    \ regarding its relevance and potential applications. One promoter pointed out\
    \ \nthat the rural population does not comprehend the value that information can\
    \ hold, \nwhich is why they still share data on production costs and productivity,\
    \ without \nunderstanding how other actors might exploit this information. The\
    \ same promoter \nindicated that certain sectors, such as the flower industry,\
    \ recognized the importance of \ndata and were thus more cautious when sharing\
    \ it. Another issue pertains to data \nownership: interviewees note that there\
    \ is no clear consensus on how this ownership \nshould be established or through\
    \ which mechanisms it should be protected. \nData bias: One researcher identified\
    \ bias in data representativeness as one of \nthe main issues concerning data.\
    \ This promoter illustrated that feeding a model with a \nlimited dataset results\
    \ in a representation bias, causing the recommendations to be \n \n \n[99] \n\
    \ \n \nunbalanced and skewed by the content of the training dataset used by the\
    \ application. In \nthis case, reflexivity on the part of developers is required\
    \ to ensure that this bias is \novercome. \nLoss of knowledge: Four promoters\
    \ indicated that they perceived a risk of the \nloss of ancestral and traditional\
    \ knowledge that might not be compatible with technified \npractices. In this\
    \ regard, the concern is that technology could promote alternative forms \nof\
    \ knowledge that displace ancestral knowledge or render certain manual labor \n\
    unnecessary, thereby resulting in the loss of manual labor techniques. \nAsymmetry\
    \ in the capacity for action among different groups of \nproducers: Interviewees\
    \ highlighted various aspects that fell within this category. One \nentrepreneur,\
    \ the co-founder of an NGO that offers digital technology skills, pointed out\
    \ \nthat a significant risk is that new players entering the market that provide\
    \ technological \nproducts and services to small producers become new intermediaries\
    \ and capture more \nvalue than they actually offer to small producers. This entrepreneur\
    \ noted that she \nobserved some individuals charging for the use of technologies\
    \ that are free, such as \nGoogle Maps. This situation is reinforced by small\
    \ producers' lack of knowledge about \ntechnologies and their uses. A promoter\
    \ leading rural development in a large NGO \nexpressed concern that technological\
    \ solutions may widen the gaps between those who \nhave access to information\
    \ and those who do not, consequently increasing market \nasymmetries and exacerbating\
    \ exclusion within the supply chains.  \n \n \n \n \n \n[100] \n \n \n4.4.4 How\
    \ to ensure digital technologies benefit Colombian small \nfarmers  \nWhen the\
    \ respondents were queried regarding the elements that ought to be \naddressed\
    \ to enhance the digital agriculture ecosystem in Colombia in such a way that\
    \ it \ncould benefit small-scale producers, they indicated the following. \n \n\
    Promoting collective action \nThe associativity among stakeholders was the first\
    \ aspect mentioned by more \nthan half of the respondents. This associativity\
    \ encompasses both producers, insofar as \nimproving their associativity increases\
    \ their collective bargaining power, and the \npromoters themselves, including\
    \ trade associations, international cooperation agencies, \nand research centers,\
    \ which are currently undertaking efforts independently and have \nnot yet converged\
    \ on a common work agenda. \nFacilitative Public Policy \nThe participants concur\
    \ with the importance of a public policy that promotes and \nsupports the sector;\
    \ however, they are not in favor of developing regulations that would \nconstrain\
    \ its growth. Instead, they mentioned the significance of fostering a public policy\
    \ \nthat bridges the gap between supply and demand and provides producers with\
    \ the \nnecessary infrastructure to utilize digital agriculture technologies.\
    \ \nPromoting Technical Assistance \nFour promoters underscored the significance\
    \ of enhancing the extension team \nthat supports the producers. One of them discussed\
    \ the importance of returning to the \nwritings of the extension itself, which\
    \ combined professionals from various disciplines to \n \n \n[101] \n \n \nachieve\
    \ comprehensive support, mindful of the social, environmental, and productive\
    \ \ndimensions that surround the lives of producers. \nBoosting business models\
    \ reaching small farmers \nThe promotion of business models that primarily aim\
    \ to include small-scale \nproducers is related to collective action among stakeholders\
    \ who promote and develop \ntechnologies. Currently, technological offerings are\
    \ mainly geared towards large \nproducers who have the capacity to afford the\
    \ prevailing prices of digital services and \nproducts. Some respondents highlighted\
    \ the need to develop innovative business models \nthat cater to the requirements\
    \ and payment capabilities of small-scale producers. One \nentrepreneur emphasized\
    \ that small producers should be approached through \ninstitutional means, that\
    \ is, with the support of local governments and regional \nadministrations, to\
    \ create conditions that enable access for small-scale producers. \nOffering services\
    \ according to the actual needs of small farmers \nAnother aspect highlighted\
    \ concerns regarding the use of the digital technology \ncurrently available in\
    \ the country. In this regard, it is not necessary to adopt cutting-edge \ntechnologies\
    \ but to seek the optimal combination of low-cost technologies and offline \n\
    services that are presently accessible and can benefit the largest number of producers.\
    \ \n \n4.5 Discussion and conclusions  \nThis study aimed to explore the perspectives\
    \ of promoters and entrepreneurs in \ndigital agriculture in Colombia regarding\
    \ their views on the current situation, \ncomplexities, and unforeseen aspects\
    \ that affect the development of the sector. The \nfindings of twenty-three interviews\
    \ with various stakeholders reveal that the respondents \nhold a broad vision\
    \ of digital agriculture, considering a wide range of technologies, from \n \n\
    \ \n[102] \n \n \nsimple ones such as WhatsApp to sophisticated ones such as machine\
    \ learning, artificial \nintelligence, and blockchain. There is also a consensus\
    \ among respondents regarding the \nprimary benefits derived from these technologies,\
    \ including efficiency, productivity, \naccess to information as support for decision-making,\
    \ traceability monitoring, and \naccess to markets. The respondents indicated\
    \ that the digital agriculture sector in \nColombia is emerging and still lacks\
    \ coordination among its actors. This is in line with \nthe studies about digitalization\
    \ in agriculture in Latin America, that show that Colombia \nmarket is growing\
    \ but still is far from the regional leaders is not the regional leaders —\nBrazil\
    \ and Argentina.  \nParticipants reflected on the contextual conditions that drive\
    \ digital technology \nadvancement in the country, including lack of technical\
    \ skills, the contradictory role of \nlarge producer associations, the lack of\
    \ digital infrastructure, and various problems \naffecting the rural sector, such\
    \ as low productivity, high input costs, generational gaps, \nand the role of\
    \ intermediaries. These factors, which mainly affect small producers, \nsuggest\
    \ that, in this emergent sector, small producers may not receive the best benefits\
    \ \nexpected from these technologies. \nExamining these results considering conceptual\
    \ discussions on digital \nagriculture, it was found that the promoters' vision\
    \ in Colombia is closely related to the \npredominant and most optimistic narrative\
    \ of the positive results in efficiency and \nproductivity that can be achieved\
    \ by producers using these technologies. Reviewing the \nframing suggested by\
    \ Glaros et al. (2023), it is found that the visions of Colombian \npromoters\
    \ align mainly with the first framework called Productivity through Precision\
    \ \n(PtP) and to a lesser extent with Traceability through Tech-Enabled Disruption\
    \ (TTD), \nfocused on transparency in the chains to increase market efficiency.\
    \ There was no \nevident link with the framing focused on Enhancing Farmers’ Rights\
    \ through \n \n \n[103] \n \n \nTechnological Sovereignty (TS).  This is relevant\
    \ because TS framing cares about \ngovernance structures, open and participatory\
    \ processes in technology development, \naspects lacking in Colombia, and crucial\
    \ to promote equitable digitalization. \nRegarding the implications of the technology\
    \ that should be considered, this \nstudy finds three different perspectives regarding\
    \ its impacts. At one extreme, some view \ntechnology as being morally and politically\
    \ neutral. The next group has not yet identified \nthe impacts, which indicates\
    \ a lack of anticipation and reflexivity, two of the principles of \nresponsible\
    \ innovation. In the third group, a varied range of factors should be considered\
    \ \nwhen implementing technology. These factors include data monopolies, data\
    \ access \nmonopolies, data privacy, data ownership, data biases, potential loss\
    \ of knowledge, and \nasymmetry in the capacity for action among different groups\
    \ of producers. It is \ninteresting to note that these factors are all associated\
    \ with power, as they present \nunequal relationships based on attributes, status,\
    \ or position in the social structure. \nConcern for data or access monopolies\
    \ indicates the existence of income inequality and \nactors with the capacity\
    \ to hoard resources. Concern about the loss of farmers' \nknowledge is associated\
    \ with the possibility of imposing research agendas and \ntechnological developments\
    \ that privilege forms of production more typical of larger \nproducers or technified\
    \ agriculture. These three perspectives demonstrate that digital \nagriculture\
    \ promoters do not correspond to a monolithic group; on the contrary, there \n\
    are diverse nuances and perceptions regarding the role of technology and the factors\
    \ that \nmust be considered for its promotion. It is crucial to acknowledge these\
    \ diverse \nperspectives to facilitate discussions and collaborative efforts towards\
    \ promoting digital \nagriculture in the country. Understanding the perception\
    \ of what technology is and can \ndo is vital for achieving a certain level of\
    \ accountability in this regard. \n \n \n[104] \n \n \nThe findings of this study\
    \ show that while there is common and widespread \noptimism about digital technologies\
    \ in agriculture, which is shared at an international \nlevel, nuances can be\
    \ observed when reviewing the perceptions of promoters within the \nsame country\
    \ that respond to the specificities of each territory. For example, in the \n\
    interviewees’ comments, the role of agricultural input vendors is highlighted\
    \ as a key \nactor because they are very close to the producer, but at the same\
    \ time with an \naccompanying agenda that may be influenced by their sales objectives.\
    \ In particular, this \naspect responds to the characteristics of Colombian agriculture,\
    \ the high intermediation \nrates, and the difficulties that producers face in\
    \ accessing information. In this sense, \npromoting responsible and inclusive\
    \ digitalization in Colombia requires a deeper \nunderstanding of the unique challenges\
    \ surrounding the agricultural sector, the views \nand interests of their actors,\
    \ and the potential and limitations of the current rural public \npolicy.  \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n[105] \n \n \nChapter Five: Concluding Remarks \n  \nThrough this\
    \ qualitative study, I explored the literature on the social and ethical \nimplications\
    \ of digital agriculture technologies, as well as the empirical situation of what\
    \ \nwas happening in Colombia. I chose to conduct my research on this topic because\
    \ I \nbelieve it holds significant conceptual potential in terms of uncovering\
    \ what these new \ndigital technologies are capable of and understanding the implications\
    \ and unintended \nconsequences they may have for both agri-food systems and the\
    \ livelihoods of small-\nscale farmers worldwide. I also believe it is an urgent\
    \ matter from a practical standpoint, \nas it is mobilizing a wide array of actors,\
    \ both familiar and unfamiliar with the agri-food \nsector, and is driving various\
    \ types of public and private actions that will affect the \nlivelihoods of people\
    \ who dedicate their lives to food production and ecosystem \nprotection.  \n\
    The literature review presented in chapter two allowed me to develop a \nframework\
    \ that acknowledges the non-neutrality of technology, the central role of power,\
    \ \nand its manifestation in both the factors that shape access and those involved\
    \ in the \ngovernance of technologies. This applied framework recognizes the importance\
    \ of \nunderstanding the different types of services offered by digital technologies\
    \ and the \nvarious moments associated with their design, access, and governance.\
    \ This \ncategorization acknowledges the diverse social relationships in which\
    \ producers are \nembedded and offers practical utility for analysis and intervention\
    \ by scholars, \npractitioners, and other stakeholders interested in promoting\
    \ digital agriculture that \nbenefits all actors, including the smallest and least\
    \ resourced. \nApplying this framework to the reality of Colombia (chapters three\
    \ and four), I \nfound a variety of actors, initiatives, and ways of doing things\
    \ unfolding in this Latin \n \n \n[106] \n \n \nAmerican country, which warrants\
    \ the construction of a research agenda focused on the \ncountry's characteristics,\
    \ its equity challenges, and the emergence of the digital \nagriculture ecosystem.\
    \ Through conversations with promoters and entrepreneurs of \ndigital agriculture,\
    \ I identified three current ways of approaching the implications of \ntechnology:\
    \ technology is neutral, no implications have yet been identified, and there are\
    \ \nmany implications, ranging from the risk of monopoly, privacy and data ownership,\
    \ \nalgorithmic bias, and asymmetry in the capacity for action among different\
    \ actors. This \nfinding suggests a need in the literature to understand how different\
    \ actors construct \nthese visions of social implications and how conversations\
    \ on accountability, monitoring, \nand assessment can be fostered among digital\
    \ agriculture promoters with different \nvisions of its implications and possibilities.\
    \ \nThis research analyzed secondary information from digital agriculture promoters\
    \ \nand entrepreneurs, as well as data from 23 elite-interviews.  One aspect brought\
    \ to light \nby this research, conducted through the lens of political economy,\
    \ is the indispensable \nconsideration of the relationship between structural\
    \ dynamics that engender inequity \nand constraints in accessing resources, and\
    \ the actual capabilities of technologies. Thus, \nit becomes imperative to challenge\
    \ the apolitical narrative that posits technology \nintegration as inevitably\
    \ yielding heightened efficiency, productivity, and profit for all. \nThis narrative\
    \ merely perpetuates existing structures and reinforces the simplistic notion\
    \ \nthat technology alone generates changes divorced from material and institutional\
    \ \ncontexts. Such a view of digitization hampers our ability to perceive that\
    \ access, in and of \nitself, is insufficient. It is important, but insufficient.\
    \ Transforming information access \ninto tangible efficiency or productivity requires\
    \ paying attention to other factors, such as \nmarket access, property rights,\
    \ land size, production types, extant capital, as well as \nindividual capability\
    \ and motivation. These days, teeming with misinformation and \nexcessive wide\
    \ access to superficial information, the critical need to discern information\
    \ \n \n \n[107] \n \n \nsources and cultivate the capacity to discriminate amidst\
    \ the deluge of daily information \nbombardment has become abundantly clear. \n\
    We must challenge and reshape this narrative to engender a dialogue about the\
    \ \nstructural and agency-level conditions requisite for advancing toward a form\
    \ of \ndigitization that spurs transformation and reaps benefits for historically\
    \ marginalized \ncommunities. This endeavor will enable us to expand our imaginative\
    \ horizons and \nfoster alternative institutions, incentives, and business models.\
    \ \nAnother salient finding arising from this study pertains to the importance\
    \ of \nemploying a lens of specificity when assessing the offerings of digital\
    \ agricultural \ntechnologies. Not all digital technologies serve identical purposes\
    \ for all individuals, nor \ndo they possess equal potential for reshaping the\
    \ status quo within diverse communities. \nIn certain circumstances, when material\
    \ and relational conditions are favorable, mere \naccess to new information can\
    \ engender positive transformations. In contrast, the ability \nto effectively\
    \ act upon novel information necessitates additional material changes, such \n\
    as access to credit or access to a better-linked network. This plethora of tangible\
    \ \npossibilities underscores the need for comprehensive case studies that enhance\
    \ our \nunderstanding of the potentialities and limitations of technology across\
    \ varying \ncontextual landscapes. \nBased on this exploratory research, I identify\
    \ two elements that are still missing \nfrom our understanding of digital agriculture\
    \ and merit in-depth exploration. First, a  \nperspective exploring links with\
    \ the environment. Currently, the conversation on digital \nagriculture technologies\
    \ is developing separately from the conversation on digital \ntechnologies addressing\
    \ environmental issues (e.g., deforestation control, fauna and \nflora inventories).\
    \ One possible avenue for further investigation is to understand the \ncollaborative\
    \ spaces and tensions that arise from these technologies, both those more \n \n\
    \ \n[108] \n \n \noriented towards productivity and those focused on reducing\
    \ environmental impact or \nconducting inventories of environmental features.\
    \ Secondly, there is a need for research \nthat critically and practically addresses\
    \ the specific challenges posed by particular digital \nproducts and services.\
    \ The problem-solving sociology perspective can serve as a source \nof inspiration\
    \ to advance in this direction. \nIn a context where investments in digital agriculture\
    \ are continuously growing, \nalong with interest in its potential outcomes, this\
    \ research demonstrates that it is urgent \nto have a better understanding of\
    \ the particularities of Latin American and African \ncountries. It is important\
    \ to know the actual and concrete offerings of various digital \nagriculture services\
    \ in these countries, as the current literature is insufficient for \nanalyzing\
    \ the implications these technologies will have in these nations. The concerns\
    \ \nthat exist in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia\
    \ are not \nthe same as those pressing in these countries. Considering the real\
    \ implications for \npeople's lives that the promotion of digital agriculture\
    \ services and products may have, it \nis necessary for applied research to serve\
    \ better decision-making and understanding of \nthe institutional arrangements,\
    \ power relations, and resources at stake in each location. \nAs an applied researcher,\
    \ I harbor the belief that a remarkable opportunity lies \nbefore us to reshape\
    \ the trajectory of digitization within the realm of agriculture. The \npresent\
    \ investigation was undertaken with the purpose of offering organized and lucid\
    \ \nconcepts, as well as evidence, capable of nourishing the ongoing conversation\
    \ amongst \nthose dedicated to leveraging digitization as a deliberate means of\

    \ \n \nVITA \nJenny Marcela Melo Velasco was born in Bogotá, Colombia (1982) and\
    \ grew up in \nCali, where she finished high school education with an emphasis\
    \ in gerontology. She \ngraduated from the Universidad del Valle in 2005. In this\
    \ public university, she obtained \na degree in Business Management. Since the\
    \ beginning of college, Jenny has been \ninterested in understanding how to promote\
    \ inclusion and fairness using the business \nsphere of influence. This interest\
    \ guided her professional path as an applied researcher \nand practitioner. \n\
    Between 2009 and 2011, with the support of a scholarship from the Organization\
    \ \nof American States, Jenny studied a Master’s in social sciences at the Universidad\
    \ \nNacional de La Plata (Argentina). After returning to Colombia, she worked\
    \ as an \nindependent researcher and consultant in different places in Latin America,\
    \ \nconceptualizing and executing knowledge management processes, combining academic\
    \ \nand practitioner perspectives for all-size companies, developmental organizations,\
    \ \nNGOs, and small farmers’ organizations. In 2018, with the support of a Fulbright-\n\
    Pasaporte a la Ciencia scholarship, Jenny started a PhD in Rural Sociology at\
    \ the \nUniversity of Missouri. She is now specializing in rural settings, particularly\
    \ in \nunderstanding and practically promoting inclusion and fairness for small\
    \ farmers \nthrough market exchanges and the implementation of technology. \n\
    Starting in 2021, Jenny co-founded Huella Delta, a social enterprise supporting\
    \ \nrural organizations to establish fair and inclusive links with the market\
    \ while advancing \nconservation goals. Huella Delta has worked in Colombia, Peru,\
    \ and Mexico. She is \nproudly the first generation to obtain a doctoral degree\
    \ in her whole family, achieving \nthis milestone in 2023. \n"

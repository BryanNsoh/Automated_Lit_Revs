    people may have regarding the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s
    agriculture industry is data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid
    emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost
    every industry including “smart agriculture” which moved the industry from statistical
    to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary changes are shaking the existing
    agriculture methods and creating new opportunities along a range of challenges.
    This article highlights the potential of wireless sensors and IoT in agriculture,
    as well as the challenges expected to be faced when integrating this technology
    with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices and communication techniques
    associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture applications are analyzed
    in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture application, like
    soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection are listed.
    How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages, from sowing
    until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore, the use
    of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable applications
    such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Optimizing water management has become one of the biggest challenges for grapevine\
    \ growers in California, especially dur-\ning drought conditions. Monitoring grapevine\
    \ water status and stress level across the whole vineyard is an essential step\
    \ for \nprecision irrigation management of vineyards to conserve water. We developed\
    \ a unified machine learning model to map leaf \nwater potential ( 휓leaf ), by\
    \ combining high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery and weather data.\
    \ We conducted \nsix unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights with a five-band multispectral\
    \ camera from 2018 to 2020 over three commercial \nvineyards, concurrently with\
    \ ground measurements of sampled vines. Using vegetation indices from the orthomosaiced\
    \ UAV \nimagery and weather data as predictors, the random forest (RF) full model\
    \ captured 77% of 휓leaf variance, with a root mean \nsquare error (RMSE) of 0.123 MPa,\
    \ and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.100 MPa, based on the validation datasets.\
    \ Air \ntemperature, vapor pressure deficit, and red edge indices such as the\
    \ normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) were \nfound as the most important\
    \ variables in estimating 휓leaf across space and time. The reduced RF models excluding\
    \ weather \nand red edge indices explained 52–48% of 휓leaf variance, respectively.\
    \ Maps of the estimated 휓leaf from the RF full model \ncaptured well the patterns\
    \ of both within- and cross-field spatial variability and the temporal change\
    \ of vine water status, \nconsistent with irrigation management and patterns observed\
    \ from the ground sampling. Our results demonstrated the utility \nof UAV-based\
    \ aerial multispectral imaging for supplementing and scaling up the traditional\
    \ point-based ground sampling \nof 휓leaf . The pre-trained machine learning model,\
    \ driven by UAV imagery and weather data, provides a cost-effective and \nscalable\
    \ tool to facilitate data-driven precision irrigation management at individual\
    \ vine levels in vineyards.\nIntroduction\nWine grapes are one of the top five\
    \ most valuable specialty \ncrops in California, generating an annual retail value\
    \ over \n$43.6 billion (CDFA 2020; Wine Institute 2020). With a \ntotal acreage\
    \ of over 250,000 ha (620,000 acres), the indus-\ntry produces above 3.5 million\
    \ tons of wine grapes per year \nand over 80% of wine in the US. The central valley,\
    \ coastal \nregions and southern California are the major wine grape \nproducing\
    \ regions in California. Dominated by Mediterra-\nnean climate with a warm and\
    \ dry growing season, most of \nvineyards in California are drip irrigated. Optimizing\
    \ water \nmanagement has become increasingly important for wine \nproducers, due\
    \ to the increasing water demand associated \nwith the expansion of specialty\
    \ crops in Central Valley (Mall \nand Herman 2019). Decrease in water availability\
    \ is further \nexacerbated by warming and drying climate. The severe \ndrought\
    \ in recent years has led to excessive ground water \npumping by growers, leading\
    \ to rapid rates of groundwater \ndepletion (Famiglietti 2014). As a result, more\
    \ restricted \ngroundwater usage is now being regulated in California via \nthe\
    \ Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) \n(Leahy 2015). This requires\
    \ growers to increase water use \nefficiency. Deficit irrigation treatments have\
    \ been widely \napplied in vineyard management in the late growing sea-\nson,\
    \ to conserve water, improve the quality of wines, and \nfacilitate harvest (Kustas\
    \ et al. 2018).\n * Zhehan Tang \n \nzhhtang@ucdavis.edu\n1 \nDepartment of Land,\

    \ mapping of water status for whole blocks is \ncritical for adaptive and precision\
    \ irrigation management \nat zonal or individual vine levels to increase water\
    \ use effi-\nciency, especially with regard to initiating irrigation (Intrigl-\n\
    iolo and Castel 2007). Typically, vine physiological water \nstatus is most commonly\
    \ assessed with stem and/or leaf \nwater potentials ( 휓stem and 휓leaf ) using\
    \ pressure chambers \n(Choné et al. 2001; Williams and Araujo 2002). However,\
    \ \nthese field measurements are labor-intensive and are usu-\nally conducted\
    \ on a very limited number of vines, limiting \ntheir utility for mapping within-field\
    \ variability and tracking \ntemporal dynamics of vineyard blocks.\nRemote sensing\
    \ techniques, including unmanned aerial \nvehicles (UAVs) and satellite based\
    \ imaging, on the other \nhand, provide valuable opportunities for mapping water\
    \ \nstress level of grapevines in a cost effective way. A few \nsmall-scale UAV\
    \ studies with multispectral imagery have \nfound that various vegetation indices\
    \ (VI) are significantly \ncorrelated with grapevine water stress level (Baluja\
    \ et al. \n2012; Espinoza et al. 2017). These included normalized dif-\nference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI) and green normalized dif-\nference vegetation index\
    \ (GNDVI) in a Cabernet Sauvignon \norchard in Washington State (r = 0.56 and\
    \ 0.65 respectively) \n(Espinoza et al. 2017), and the ratio of transformed chloro-\n\
    phyll absorption in the reflectance index (TCARI) over opti-\nmized soil-adjusted\
    \ vegetation index (OSAVI) (R2 = 0.84) \nover a commercial rain-fed Tempranillo\
    \ vineyard in Spain \n(Baluja et al. 2012). The performance of several narrowband\
    \ \nreflectance indices from spectroradiometers has also been \nevaluated for\
    \ grapevine water status detection over a com-\nmercial Pinot noir vineyard in\
    \ California (Rodríguez-Pérez \net al. 2007), and red/green index (RGI) and structure\
    \ inten-\nsive pigment index (SIPI) performed best for canopy-level \nwater status\
    \ estimation (R2 = 0.62 and 0.54). High resolution \nUAV thermal imagery has also\
    \ been used to derive crop \nwater stress index (CWSI) for mapping grapevine 휓leaf\
    \ over \na Pinot noir vineyard in Spain with a R2 of 0.83 (Bellvert \net al. 2014).\n\
    At a coarser spatial resolution, several studies have \nattempted to use multispectral\
    \ and/or thermal satellite imagery \nfor detecting grapevine water stress. Bellvert\
    \ et al. (2020), for \nexample, evaluated the feasibility of using Sentinel-2\
    \ optical \nand Sentinel-3 thermal imagery in the two-source energy bal-\nance\
    \ model for determining spatially distributed vine water \nstatus via a CWSI–휓leaf\
    \ relationship. They found that CWSI \nat the satellite resolution, even after\
    \ sharpening the thermal \nimagery, was not as reliable as those from finer resolution\
    \ \nairborne thermal imagery. At the individual vineyard level, \nlinear models\
    \ were developed to estimate grapevine 휓stem with \ntime-series of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) from 3 m PlanetScope \nsatellite imageries (Helman et al. 2018),\
    \ based on data from 82 \nvineyards in Israel. Kandylakis and Karantzalos (2016)\
    \ found \nred-edge bands from WorldView-2 satellite imageries provided \nadditional\
    \ information in estimating vine biophysical and bio-\nchemical properties.\n\
    Recently more sophisticated approaches such as artificial \nneural network (ANN)\
    \ machine learning model have been \ndeveloped to predict the temporal dynamics\
    \ of vine water \nstress level over a vineyard in China (Romero et al. 2018) \n\
    and in Chile (Poblete et al. 2017), by combining multiple \nVIs and spectral reflectance.\
    \ The machine learning model \nhad better performance for estimating 휓leaf with a\
    \ R2 of  0.83 \nover three dates (Romero et al. 2018). In contrast, models \n\
    based on single VI could only capture less than 23% of vari-\nance in measured\
    \ 휓leaf . This is mostly because various VIs \nand reflectance in individual bands\
    \ carry complementary \ninformation about the structure, vigor, and physiology\
    \ (Xue \nand Su 2017).\nMost of these studies were conducted within one single\
    \ \nvineyard. It is not clear how robust those water stress map-\nping approaches\
    \ are when being applied across vineyards \nwith different cultivars, management\
    \ practices, environmen-\ntal and climate conditions (Helman et al. 2018). Physiologi-\n\
    cal studies have shown that weather conditions, including \nair temperature, relative\
    \ humidity, and vapor pressure deficit \n(VPD), regulate plant stomatal closure\
    \ and water exchange \nwith atmosphere, and thus directly affect plant water status\
    \ \nsignificantly (Garnier and Berger 1985; Ortuño et al. 2006). \nHowever, previous\
    \ studies haven’t incorporated weather data \nfor plant water stress monitoring along\
    \ with remotely sensed \nimagery.\nThis study aims to develop a generalized remote\
    \ sens-\ning approach to monitor the spatial variability and tempo-\nral dynamics\
    \ of 휓leaf in California’s vineyards, using high \nresolution multispectral UAV\
    \ imagery and weather data. \nWe leveraged the extensive field campaigns from\
    \ the Grape \nRemote Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspira-\ntion eXperiment\
    \ (GRAPEX), a multi-year collaboration \nbetween E. & J. Gallo Winery, U.S. Department\
    \ of Agricul-\ntural Research Service (USDA-ARS), and several universi-\nties\
    \ (Kustas et al. 2018). Our specific objectives include (1) \nevaluating the capability\
    \ and robustness of UAV-based mul-\ntispectral 휓leaf models for monitoring grapevine\
    \ water status \nacross vineyards; (2) developing machine learning models \nto\
    \ combine UAV imagery and weather data for improved \nmonitoring; and (3) examining\
    \ the added values of weather \nand red edge spectral band for mapping wine grape\
    \ water \nstatus through time.\nMaterials and methods\nSite description\nThis\
    \ study focused on three commercial mature drip-irri-\ngated vineyards. Two of\
    \ them were planted to Vitis vinifera \n717\nIrrigation Science (2022) 40:715–730\
    \ \n1 3\ncv. Petite Sirah (BAR007) and Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet \nSauvignon\
    \ (BAR012) in 2013 and 2010 respectively, and \nlocated near Cloverdale, in Sonoma\
    \ County. The third one \nis located more inland, near Fresno in the southern\
    \ part \nof the Central Valley (RIP 720); the 16-ha vineyard was \nplanted in\
    \ 2013 to Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot (Fig. 1). The \nstudy region has a typical\
    \ Mediterranean climate, char-\nacterized by mild winters and hot dry summers.\
    \ The bud \nbreak typically occurs in mid-March to early April, fol-\nlowed by\
    \ flowering and fruit set late spring to early sum-\nmer. Veraison starts in mid\
    \ to late July, after which deficit \nirrigation is usually applied to cut water\
    \ use and improve \ngrape quality. Grapes in these blocks are typically har-\n\
    vested in late September to early October.\nThe BAR012 and BAR007 vineyards have\
    \ hilly topogra-\nphy and gravelly loam soil. In both fields, vines are trellised\
    \ \nand trained in a split canopy with 1.8 m vine spacing and \n3.35 m row spacing.\
    \ The vine rows are oriented differently \nin these two fields, along northwest\
    \ to southeast in BAR007 \nvs. northeast-southwest direction in BAR012. The RIP720\
    \ \nvineyard is flat, dominated by sandy loam soil, and has much \nwarmer climate\
    \ than the BAR blocks (Kustas et al. 2018). \nThe Merlot vines were planted with\
    \ east–west row orienta-\ntion and 3.35 m row spacing and 1.52 m vine spacing.\
    \ This \nvineyard was split into 4 blocks, allowing for different irri-\ngation\
    \ treatments to each block (T1, T2, T3, T4) (Fig. 1). In \n2018, T1 and T2 blocks\
    \ were under deficit irrigation (with \napplied water equivalent to only 75% of\
    \ evapotranspiration), \nwhile T3 and T4 blocks had no water stress treatments.\
    \ In \n2020, T1 was well watered, while the irrigation in T2, T3 \nand T4 was\
    \ reduced in late July to induce different water \nstress levels, and those three\
    \ blocks were then intensively \nirrigated from late July to early August to achieve\
    \ full recov-\nery from water stress.\nSeven Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs)\
    \ were con-\nducted in 2018–2020, typically between early June and early \nAugust,\
    \ and scheduled around 1 to 2 Landsat overpasses. \nVine canopies were fully developed,\
    \ and the phenological \nstages ranged from pea sized grape to various degrees\
    \ of rip-\nening depending on the IOP. During all the IOPs, the cover \ncrop had\
    \ been mowed or was already senesced (stubble). \nVarious ground measurements\
    \ and aerial imagery were col-\nlected during the IOP around Landsat and Sentinel\
    \ satellite \noverpassing dates.\nUAV flights and image processing\nWe acquired\
    \ multispectral aerial imagery using the \nMicaSense RedEdge camera integrated\
    \ to a DJI Matrice \n100 quadcopter during 2018–2020 growing seasons. The \nMicaSense\
    \ RedEdge camera have five spectral bands to \nrecord reflected radiation at blue\
    \ (centered at 475 nm), green \nFig. 1  Study area (inset) and \nexperiment design\

    1 3\n(560 nm), red (668 nm), red-edge (717 nm), and near infra-\nred (840 nm)\
    \ (MicaSense Inc. Washington, USA1). A sun \nirradiance sensor was installed on\
    \ the top of the quadcopter \nto measure the incoming solar irradiance for each\
    \ spectral \nband.\nA total of eight flights were conducted over the study \n\
    vineyards (Table 1). The same flight plan was designed and \nexecuted with 80%\
    \ front overlap and 80% side overlap. The \nUAV system was flown at 120 m above\
    \ ground level, result-\ning in aerial images at 8 cm resolution. All flights\
    \ were con-\nducted around solar noon to reduce the impacts of shadows. \nThe\
    \ photos of the calibrated reflectance panel were taken \nimmediately before and\
    \ after each flight for radiometric \ncalibration. In each vineyard, we placed\
    \ five ground con-\ntrol points (GCPs) for georeference, four at the corners and\
    \ \none at the center. The GPS coordinates were recorded using \nTrimble Geo 7x\
    \ (Trimble, CA, USA).\nThe raw multispectral images were stitched and pro-\ncessed\
    \ with the Pix4DMapper Pro photogrammetry software \n(Pix4D LLC, Swiss). The software\
    \ generated the automatic \ntie points initially. The coordinates of the GCPs\
    \ were then \nimported to ensure the geolocation accuracy, resulting a geo-\n\
    reference error lower than 30 cm. At the second step, the \npoint cloud and 3D\
    \ textured mesh were constructed based \non the automatic tie points, and the\
    \ digital surface model \nwas further created. Radiometric calibration was performed\
    \ \nusing the measurements of the calibration panel, to generate \northomosaics\
    \ of reflectance maps at 8 cm for each spectral \nband. Image co-registration\
    \ was further performed to ensure \nthe spatial alignment among imagery acquired\
    \ from multiple \ndates.\nWe calculated multiple widely-used VIs with the reflec-\n\
    tance from different bands from the orthomosaics as \ndescribed above (see Table 2).\
    \ NDVI is the most widely \nused vegetation index for monitoring plant growth,\
    \ vigor, \nand structure (Rouse et al. 1974). Several studies have also \nfound\
    \ NDVI is significantly related to overall plant stress \nlevel, as a result of\
    \ cumulative water deficit on plant growth \n(Acevedo-Opazo et al. 2008; Baluja\
    \ et al. 2012; Poblete \net al. 2017). However, there is latency in the response\
    \ of \nNDVI and other spectral indices to the onset of vegetation \nstress, which\
    \ thermal-infrared based approaches can read-\nily detect as long as an image\
    \ is available (Knipper et al. \n2019). Various indexes were developed to reduce\
    \ the noise \nfrom background soil, such as soil adjusted vegetation \nindex (SAVI)\
    \ and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index \n(OSAVI) (Huete 1988; Rondeaux\
    \ et al. 1996), and to reduce \nthe atmospheric effect, e.g., atmospherically\
    \ resistant veg-\netation index (ARVI) (Kaufman and Tanre 1992). Enhanced \nvegetation\
    \ index (EVI) was developed to improve sensitiv-\nity in high biomass conditions\
    \ while minimizing soil and \natmosphere influences (Huete et al. 2002). Another\
    \ group of \nVIs take advantage of the green band, i.e., GNDVI, simple \nratio\
    \ green (SRgreen), green red vegetation index (GRVI), \nto enhance chlorophyll\
    \ pigment concentration signal (Gitel-\nson and Merzlyak 1998; Chen 1996; Motohka\
    \ et al. 2010). \nBy using reflectance from the red edge band, NDRE, plant \n\
    senescence reflectance index (PSRI) and red edge green \nindex (REGI) were also\
    \ found to be good indicators of can-\nopy chlorophyll content (Barnese et al.\
    \ 2000; Tilling et al. \n2007; Merzlyak et al. 1999).\nTo separate vine canopy\
    \ and soil pixels, we applied the \nOtsu thresholding method (Otsu 1979) to the\
    \ NDVI imagery \nfrom each flight. The NDVI histogram over all pixels showed \n\
    a bimodal distribution, one representing plant canopy and \nthe other representing\
    \ soil background. The Otsu thresh-\nolding method determined the optimal thresholding\
    \ value \nto maximize the between-class variance and minimize the \nwithin-class\
    \ variance (Meyer and Neto 2008). The soil back-\nground pixels were then masked\
    \ out, and only the remaining \nvegetated pixels were used for further analysis\
    \ (Fig. 1). Con-\nsidering the typical vine canopy size is about 200 cm in our\
    \ \nstudy vineyards, we further applied a 60 cm buffer from the \ncenter of the\
    \ canopy to further exclude potentially remain-\ning mixed pixels at the canopy\
    \ edge; the average reflectance \nand VIs within the buffer were then extracted\
    \ to match the \nTable 1  Availability of the UAV \nimagery and concurrent ground\

    \ \n1 3\ncanopy of the sampled grapevines in the field as shown in \nthe following\
    \ section.\nField measurements\nBiophysical measurements were collected over 4\
    \ vines for \neach of the four blocks in the RIP720 vineyard, and over 10 \nvines\
    \ in both BAR007 and BAR012 (Fig. 1). Within each \nblock, vines were selected\
    \ at the upwind locations from each \nflux tower in the predominant wind direction,\
    \ and we sam-\npled as many vines as possible within an hour to ensure \nthat\
    \ measurements within a day were collected under similar \nweather and sunlight\
    \ conditions. We collected the high pre-\ncision GPS coordinates of all sampled\
    \ vines with Trimble \nGeo 7x. Leaf water potentials (휓leaf ) were measured concur-\n\
    rently with the UAV flights, using pressure chambers (PMS \nInc., Oregon, USA2)\
    \ during a 1-h time window centered at \nlocal solar noon. For each sampled vine,\
    \ three mature and \nsun exposed leaves were selected for measurements. The \n\
    number of measured sample vines concurrent with UAV \nflights, for each IOP is\
    \ listed in Table 1, along with weather \nconditions.\nWe downloaded the hourly\
    \ weather data including air \ntemperature and relative humidity from CIMIS station\
    \ web-\nsite (https:// cimis. water. ca. gov/). The closest stations, the \nFresno\
    \ State (#80) and Sanel Valley (#106) CIMIS stations, \nwere selected for the\
    \ RIP720 and BAR007/012 vineyards, \nrespectively. These stations were 12 and\
    \ 20 km away from \nthe nearby vineyards. A comparison with data from the \nweather\
    \ stations in the field showed a pretty good agreement. \nWe calculated hourly\
    \ VPD and averaged air temperature and \nVPD around solar noon (12:00–14:00) to\
    \ represent the cor-\nresponding weather condition for each flight.\nStatistical\
    \ approaches for leaf water potential \nestimation\nWe first examined the univariable\
    \ relationships between \nthe field measured 휓leaf and the VIs, using Pearson\
    \ corre-\nlation coefficients (r). This provided a baseline evaluation \nabout\
    \ the capability of 휓leaf mapping with a simple remotely \nsensed VI. Correlation\
    \ was done first for each vineyard and \neach flight date, respectively; data\
    \ from all days for each \nvineyard (n = 40 for RIP720 and n = 6 for BAR007, n\
    \ = 11 \nfor BAR012) were then pooled together to quantify the cor-\nrelation\
    \ across dates and sampled vines within each vine-\nyard. Finally, all data points\
    \ (n = 57) were used for general \ncorrelation across all days and vineyards.\n\
    To develop a robust model for 휓leaf estimation, we \nexplored various statistical\
    \ approaches to combine remote \nsensing metrics and weather data. In addition\
    \ to stepwise \nlinear regression (LR), we explored three machine learning \n\
    algorithms to capture potential non-linear complex relation-\nships, i.e., support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) (Pasolli et al. \n2011), random forest (RF) (Zhou et al.\

    \ used in remote \nsensing applications for biophysical parameter estimation \n\
    (Tuia et al. 2011), soil moisture estimation (Pasolli et al. \n2011), land surface\
    \ temperature estimation (Moser and \nSerpico 2009), etc. This algorithm aims\
    \ to find the best fit \nhyperplane that has the maximum number of points with-\n\

    \ prone to overfitting problems and it \nhas good generalization capability when\
    \ training samples \nare very limited (Calderón et al. 2015). The RF algorithm\

    \ applications, such as biomass estimation \n(Zhou et al. 2016) and surface temperature\

    \ speed, scal-\nability, and high efficiency. Different from RF, the decision\
    \ \ntrees in XGB were not independent from each other. The \nnew tree was built\
    \ based on previous tree by minimizing \nthe prediction residuals. The XGB algorithm\
    \ was found to \noutperform RF and SVR in some remote sensing applica-\ntions,\
    \ with higher prediction accuracy and less overfitting \nproblems (Ghatkar et al.\
    \ 2019; Pham et al. 2020).\nWe built the above machine learning models using the\
    \ \n“Caret” package in R (Kuhn 2008). To improve the model \nperformance and reduce\
    \ the number of potentially corre-\nlated predictors, the recursive feature elimination\
    \ method \nwas applied for feature selection. This method iteratively \nfollows\
    \ these steps: fit the data with all features given the \nspecific model, rank\
    \ the importance of all features, remove \nthe feature that is least important,\
    \ and refit the model. These \nsteps are performed iteratively until the model\
    \ with the least \nRMSE is found (Kuhn, 2008). The recursive feature elimi-\n\
    nation was done independently for each machine learning \nalgorithms, and only\
    \ the selected variables were used for \nmodel building. A repeated k-fold cross-validation\
    \ method \n(k = 5, repeat = 10) was applied for both model building and \ntesting.\
    \ For each of the five folds, 80% of the observations \n(n = 45) were randomly\
    \ selected as the training set, and the \nrest 20% (n = 12) were used as the independent\
    \ testing set. \nWe evaluated the model performance using three statisti-\ncal\
    \ measures: the coefficient of determination (R2), the root \nmean squared error\
    \ (RMSE), and the mean absolute error \n(MAE) for each fold. The process was repeated\
    \ 10 times and \nthe mean and standard deviations of the statistical measures\
    \ \nwere summarized from five folds results.\nTo further evaluate the value of\
    \ incorporating weather \nvariables in the models, we also built and tested the\
    \ reduced \nmodels with a subset of input variables, i.e., excluding the \nweather\
    \ variables (NoWeather). Considering that many low \ncost sensors do not have\
    \ the red edge band, another set of \nreduced models were tested by further excluding\
    \ the red \nedge reflectance and all red-edge VIs from the list of the \npredictors\
    \ (e.g., NoRedEdgeNoWeather).\nVariable importance and response functions\nWe\
    \ quantified the importance of each predictor in estimat-\ning leaf water potential,\
    \ using a metric called mean increase \nin node purity (the randomForest package\
    \ in R), which is \nthe average residual sum of squares decreases from splitting\
    \ \non the variables over all trees (Strobl et al. 2008) and thus \nrepresents\
    \ each variable’s contribution to the improvement \nof the final prediction. To\
    \ further understand the effects of \neach key predictor on 휓leaf , we derived\
    \ the individual condi-\ntional expectation (ICE) plots (Goldstein et al. 2015).\
    \ Unlike \nthe partial dependence plots (PDP), the ICE plots not only \nquantify\
    \ the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted \noutcome of a fitted model\
    \ over all samples (Lemmens and \nCroux 2006), but also depict the dependence\
    \ of the predic-\ntion on a feature for each sample separately (Goldstein et al.\
    \ \n2015). The ICE plots can thus show how the specific vari-\nable affects the\
    \ final prediction and at which values the influ-\nence of the variable is stronger\
    \ (Arribas-Bel et al. 2017). The \nheterogeneous relationships, that are typically\
    \ obscured in \nthe PDP plots, are thus revealed.\nField mapping and analysis\
    \ of predicted Ã퐥퐞퐚퐟\nThe model with the best performance was then used to map\
    \ \nthe 휓leaf over the entire orchard for each flight, using the \ncorresponding\
    \ weather and VIs as predicting variables. To \nexamine whether the spatial and\
    \ temporal pattern of the pre-\ndicted 휓leaf matched the treatments in the RIP720\
    \ vineyard, \nwe extracted the values of the predicted 휓leaf map for each \nblock,\
    \ and generated the boxplots of the predicted 휓leaf for \neach block across different\
    \ dates. In addition, to compare \nwith the measured 휓leaf , the distribution\
    \ of the predicted 휓leaf \nfor each date was plotted as histogram.\nResults\n\
    Relationship between leaf water potential and VIs \nand weather variables\nWithin\
    \ each vineyard, 휓leaf was found significantly corre-\nlated with the majority\
    \ of vegetation indices over all sam-\npled vines across multiple days (Table 3).\
    \ All VIs had a \n721\nIrrigation Science (2022) 40:715–730 \n1 3\ncorrelation\
    \ coefficient higher than 0.8 (p < 0.01), based \non the data acquired during\
    \ the two available flights in \n2019 over the two BAR vineyards (n = 17). VIs\
    \ based on \nthe reflectance contrasts in the NIR and red bands, such \nas NDVI,\
    \ ARVI, EVI, SAVI and OSAVI, had higher cor-\nrelation with 휓leaf (r > 0.88) than\
    \ other indices. VIs based \non green band, i.e., GNDVI, GRVI and SRgreen, were\
    \ \nalso highly correlated with 휓leaf , with r higher than 0.83. \nAmong chlorophyll\
    \ indices, NDRE was strongly correlated \n(r = 0.84) while REGI was the least\
    \ correlated (r = 0.68). \nIn the RIP720 vineyard, the correlation between VIs\
    \ and \n휓leaf when combining all four flights in 2018 and 2020, were \nlower than\
    \ those from the two BAR blocks, although signifi-\ncant. Among them, NDRE had\
    \ the highest correlation with \nr = 0.56 (p < 0.001). However, when combining\
    \ all data from \nthree vineyards (BAR007, BAR012 and RIP720), the cor-\nrelations\
    \ between most VIs and 휓leaf were much lower and \nstatistically less significant.\
    \ NDRE and GRVI were the only \nVIs that were significantly correlated with 휓leaf\
    \ , with a cor-\nrelation coefficient of −0.27 (p < 0.01) and 0.25 (p < 0.01)\
    \ \n(n = 57), respectively (Fig. 2). \nWhen evaluating the correlation between\
    \ spatial vari-\nability of VIs with the measured 휓leaf within each vineyard,\
    \ \nthe performance of any single VI varied among different \ndays, especially\
    \ over RIP720. Over BAR007 and BAR012, \nslightly higher correlations were found\
    \ in late June than late \nJuly; chlorophyll indices performed better on 27 June\
    \ 2019, \nas PSRI and REGI had correlation with 휓leaf higher than 0.9. \nThe structural\
    \ indices had better performance on the second \ndate (29 July 2019), e.g., structural\
    \ indices had a correlation \nhigher than 0.82. For RIP720, correlations were\
    \ generally \nhigher for data acquired on 2 Aug 2020, while no significant \n\
    correlation between VIs and 휓leaf was found on 26 July 2020. \nSimilarly, for\
    \ the 2018 RIP720 flights, data acquired in later \ngrowing season showed higher\
    \ correlation than the earlier \ndays. The structural indices were only highly\
    \ correlated with \n휓leaf on the second day (5 Aug 2018), with most correlations\
    \ \nhigher than 0.6, while greenness index, e.g. GNDVI, and \nchlorophyll index,\
    \ e.g. NDRE, had stable performance in \ntwo days, with r > 0.64. This shows that\
    \ canopy structure \nindices were less sensitive to the vine water stress status\
    \ than \nchlorophyll indices.\nWe also found that the weather variables including\
    \ air \ntemperature and VPD had a significant linear relationship \nwith 휓leaf\
    \ across multiple vineyards and days (Fig. 3). The \nR2 between them versus 휓leaf\
    \ were highest for air tempera-\nture (R2 = 0.59). For this particular scenario,\
    \ higher air tem-\nperature was found to enhance water stress by 0.055 in 휓leaf\
    \ \n(MPa) per °C increase in temperature based on the univariate \nregression.\
    \ VPD also explained more than 50% of variations \nacross days and vineyards.\
    \ Higher VPD lead to higher water \nstress in grapevines. 1 kPa increase of VPD\
    \ would increase \n휓leaf by 0.214 MPa.\nTable 3  The Pearson correlation coefficients\

    1 3\nEstimating Ã퐥퐞퐚퐟 based on machine learning models\nWhen pooling the data\
    \ across all days and over the three \nvineyard blocks, the recursive feature\
    \ elimination process \nresulted in a total of 10 variables to be included for\
    \ the final \n휓leaf models. Selected weather variables include air tempera-\n\
    ture and VPD, and VIs included NDRE, PSRI, EVI, GRVI, \nSAVI and SR. Two machine\
    \ learning models, RF and XGB, \noutperformed other models (Table 4). The predicted\
    \ 휓leaf \nby the RF full model agreed well with the measurements \n(Fig. 4), explaining\
    \ more than 78% of variance in the inde-\npendent testing data, with a RMSE of\
    \ 0.123 (±0.03) MPa \nand a MAE of 0.100 (±0.026) MPa (Fig. 4; Table 4). Other\
    \ \nregression models had R2 lower than 0.67. The RF model \nperformed slightly\
    \ better than the XGB model and therefore \nwas used for the following analysis.\

    723\nIrrigation Science (2022) 40:715–730 \n1 3\nWe found that removing weather\
    \ variables from the input \nvariables, i.e., models with only remote sensing\
    \ inputs, sig-\nnificantly reduced the prediction accuracy across all mod-\nels\
    \ (Table 4). For example, the RF model without weather \nvariables only explained\
    \ 52% of spatial and temporal varia-\ntion in the observed 휓leaf and resulted\
    \ in higher uncertainty \nas shown by higher RMSE of 0.189 MPa and MAE of \n0.146 MPa.\
    \ The robustness of the model also decreased, as \nshown by the increase of the\
    \ standard deviation of the sta-\ntistics from the repeated fivefold validation\
    \ (Table 4). When \nfurther excluding the remote sensing metrics related to the\
    \ \nred edge bands, the reduced RF models could only explain \n48% of spatial\
    \ and temporal variation in 휓leaf (Table 4). We \nalso found that the decrease\
    \ in the prediction capability of \nthe reduced models was most significant for\
    \ SVM and step-\nwise linear regression approaches.\nVariable importance and determinants\
    \ of Ã퐥퐞퐚퐟\nBased on the RF full model, we found that the weather varia-\nbles,\
    \ including mean air temperature and VPD at noon, were \nthe most important predictors,\
    \ followed by the chlorophyll \nindices NDRE and PSRI (Fig. 5). The average RMSE\
    \ across \nall decision trees would increase by 0.75 and 0.70 MPa when \nexcluding\
    \ air temperature or VPD from the full RF model, \nrespectively. When NDRE (or\
    \ PSRI) was not included in \nthe RF model, the mean RMSE of the predicted leaf\
    \ water \npotential would increase by 0.32 MPa (or 0.24 MPa).\nIn the reduced\
    \ model without weather variables, the \ngreenness index GRVI and the chlorophyll\
    \ index NDRE \nbecame most important. Excluding GRVI or NDRE from \nthe NoWeather\
    \ model would result in an increase of RMSE \nof 0.95 and 0.72 MPa, respectively.\
    \ Their importance was \nmuch higher than NIR, EVI and PSRI, with mean RMSE \n\
    increase ranging from 0.32 to 0.55.\nIn the reduced model without weather and\
    \ red edge vari-\nables, the greenness index GRVI, and the canopy structure-\n\
    related band and index NIR and EVI became dominant for \nestimating 휓leaf . The\
    \ mean RMSE across all trees would \nincrease by 0.91, 0.78 and 0.50 MPa when\
    \ GRVI, NIR and \nEVI were not included.\nTable 4  Model performance from cross\

    trated the marginalized impact of key variables on the 휓leaf \n(Fig. 6). Warmer\
    \ temperature was shown to increase water \nstress only slightly when the air\
    \ temperature at noon was \nbelow 27.5 °C, but enhanced water stress dramatically\
    \ \nbeyond 27.5 °C (Fig. 6a). Similarly, higher VPD enhanced \nwater stress as\
    \ well, with the highest impacts between 2.5 \nand 3.0 kPa (Fig. 6b). The rapid\
    \ increase of water stress \nbeyond 27.5 °C and 2.5 kPa were constant over all\
    \ samples. \nAmong the VIs, we found that higher NDRE and higher EVI \nwere associated\
    \ with lower 휓leaf . The water stress decreased \nrapidly when NDRE reached 0.43\
    \ and 0.53 (Fig. 6c). The \nwater stress generally decreased with the increase\
    \ of EVI, \nespecially when EVI was above 0.78. Decreased water stress \nwas also\
    \ observed when EVI reached 0.6 and 0.65 over part \nof samples, while there were\
    \ some exceptions that don’t have \nsimilar patterns.\nÃ퐥퐞퐚퐟 mapping and analysis\
    \ of the predicted Ã퐥퐞퐚퐟\nThe 휓leaf map predicted by the RF full model using the\
    \ UAV \nimagery and weather data showed a large spatial heterogene-\nity over\
    \ the RIP720 vineyard (Fig. 7). The estimated median \n휓leaf of block T1 and T2\
    \ were around −1.54 and −1.58 MPa \non July 12th, 2018, significantly lower than\
    \ the median 휓leaf \nof −1.48 and −1.52 MPa over blocks T3 and T4 (Fig. 7a). \n\
    Similarly, on August 5th, 2018, blocks T1 and T2 were more \nstressed than T3\
    \ and T4, with a median 휓leaf of −1.60 vs. \n−1.53 MPa (Fig. 7b). This was consistent\
    \ with the irrigation \ntreatments that less water was applied to block T1 and\
    \ T2 in \n2018. In 2020, the majority of T1 showed less water stress \nlevel than\
    \ the other three blocks on both days (Fig. 7c, d). \nThis also agreed well with\
    \ the different irrigation treatment \nin 2020 applied to block T1.\nThe predicted\
    \ 휓leaf maps also captured the overall tem-\nporal dynamics of 휓leaf (Figs. 7\
    \ and 8), consistent with the \npatterns observed by the ground measurements over\
    \ the \nsampled vines. The block T1 and T2 were more stressed \nin August than\
    \ July in 2018 (Figs. 7a, b and 8), due to \ndeficit irrigation strategy typically\
    \ implemented later in \nthe season. In contrast, all four blocks recovered from\
    \ \nwater stress between July 26th to August 2nd after the \nintensive irrigation\
    \ in 2020. Although in the predicted \nmaps, we found T2 were more stressed than\
    \ T3 and T4 in \n2020, which was different from the irrigation plan. This \nis\
    \ likely because the sampled vines did not well represent \nthe within block distribution\
    \ of estimated 휓leaf (Figs. 7d, \n9), especially due to the limited samples within\
    \ each block \nover each sample day, with sample sizes ranging from 6 to \n12.\
    \ For example, the ground measurements of 휓leaf on July \n12, 2018 (Fig. 9a) and\
    \ on July 26, 2020 (Fig. 9c) ranged \nfrom −1.67 to −1.48 MPa, and −1.65 to −1.55 MPa,\

    Capability of machine learning models driven \nby UAV imagery\nOur study demonstrated\
    \ that the multispectral imageries \nand weather information can be integrated\
    \ into a machine \nlearning model to capture the spatial and temporal vari-\n\
    ability of 휓leaf across different vineyards. The unified ran-\ndom forest full\
    \ model based on UAV multispectral image-\nries and weather variables were shown\
    \ to perform well \nover three vineyards with different varieties, soils, and\
    \ \nspacing, and blocks of varying irrigation treatments. The \nassessment with\
    \ independent validation data showed better \nor similar accuracy (R2 of 78%,\
    \ RMSE of 0.122 MPa and \nMAE of 0.099 MPa), than those reported by other vineyard\
    \ \nstudies with multi-spectral UAV imagery. In the current lit-\nerature, Romero\
    \ et al. (2018) sampled 16 vines in one sin-\ngle vineyard in China for each one\
    \ of the 5 days, and built \nan ANN machine learning model to estimate 휓stem from\
    \ \nUAV multispectral images with an RMSE = 0.32 MPa and \nMAE = 0.35 MPa for\
    \ the validation set (20% of the total \ndata points). Another ANN study (Poblete\

    \ uncertainty for the validation set \n(RMSE = 0.12 MPa and MSE = 0.1 MPa).\n\
    Impacts of weather and red edge metrics on water \nstress level estimation\nOur\
    \ RF modeling analysis highlighted the importance of \nincorporating weather variables,\
    \ including noontime mean \nair temperature and VPD to capture water stress level\
    \ \nthrough time and across multiple vineyards. This finding \nis supported by\
    \ the concept of the soil–plant-atmosphere \ncontinuum (Elfving et al. 1972),\
    \ governing the plant water \nstress level as quantified by the 휓leaf . Suter\
    \ et al. (2019) \nsuggested that to allow for temporal comparisons of plant \n\
    water potential, a standardization of plant water potential \nwith both soil water\
    \ availability and weather conditions is \nrequired. Similarly, studies have been\
    \ conducted to build \na baseline 휓leaf or 휓stem as a function of VPD to inter-\n\
    pret the measurements and manage irrigation for prune \n(McCutchan and Shackel\
    \ 1992), almond (Shackel et al. \n1997) and grapevine (Williams and Baeza 2007;\
    \ Olivo \net al. 2009). The calculation of CWSI also includes the \nweather conditions.\
    \ The lower baseline of CWSI was \ndetermined by the relationship between VPD\
    \ and the dif-\nference of canopy and air temperature of well-watered \nplants\
    \ (Jackson et al. 1981).\nWe also found that the remote sensing metrics involv-\n\
    ing the red edge spectral band further increased the \ncapability of estimating\
    \ vine water stress. The red edge \nband and indices have been reported to be\
    \ associated \nwith chlorophyll content and physiological status (Barnes \net al.\
    \ 2000; Clevers et al. 2010; Clevers and Gitelson \n2013). As low chlorophyll\
    \ content usually reflects that \nthe plants are under stress, the red edge based\
    \ indices \nFig. 6  The individual condi-\ntional expectation plot of the \nleaf\

    \ disease in soybean (Brodbeck et al. 2017) \nand water deficiency in maize (Becker\
    \ et al. 2020).\nUncertainties and future work\nAlthough promising as a proof\
    \ of concept, our results are \nlimited by the available ground measurements due\
    \ to the \nchallenging in collecting 휓leaf with pressure chambers in the \nFig.\

    \ by the number and diversity of the \nsampled vineyards. To further test and\
    \ improve the robust-\nness of the model, more field survey data and concurrent\
    \ \nUAV flights are needed to represent a broader range of vine-\nyards, environmental\
    \ conditions, and water stress levels. For \nexample, more samples over different\
    \ cultivars and trailing \nsystems will allow us to examine how other factors\
    \ may \naffect the model performance. Given a sufficient number of \nground truth\
    \ data covering various water status, machine \nlearning based classification\
    \ approach can also be developed \nto detect the categorical stress levels, e.g.,\
    \ from low, moder-\nate, to severe stress to guide irrigation management.\nOur\
    \ study only used optical metrics derived from five \nspectral bands available\
    \ from the MicaSense camera. Unlike \nthermal data, the VIs generated from UAV\
    \ multispectral data \ncan only detect water stress levels indirectly and thus\
    \ have \ncertain limitations. For example, the VIs have been reported \nto perform\
    \ differently when predicting the grapevine water \nstress levels for different\
    \ cultivars and different growth \nstages. For example, widely-used canopy structure\
    \ index \nNDVI was found to have high correlation with 휓stem (Baluja \net al.\
    \ 2012) of rain-fed Tempranillo vines, with R2 = 0.68, \nbut had relatively low\
    \ correlation with stomatal conduct-\nance (R2 = 0.32) of subsurface-irrigated\
    \ Cabernet Sauvignon \nvines (Espinoza et al. 2017) and 휓stem (R2 = 0.35) of drip-\n\
    irrigated Carmenere vines (Poblete et al. 2017). Chlorophyll \nindex TCARI/OSAVI\
    \ was reported to have high correlation \nwith 휓stem (R2 = 0.68) of rain-fed Tempranillo\
    \ vines, but not \nsignificant correlation with 휓stem (R2 = 0.09, p > 0.05) for\
    \ \ndrip-irrigated Carmenere vines (Poblete et al. 2017).\nWe also found different\
    \ performances of VI-based \napproaches across vineyards. In BAR007 and BAR012,\
    \ \nthe different water stress levels among different vines were \nprobably caused\
    \ more by different topography, soil condi-\ntions, cultivars, and long-term irrigation\
    \ strategies. These \nlong-term factors contributed to distinct plant physiological\
    \ \nvariables among different vines, which can be well captured \nby VIs. For\
    \ example, topography likely affects the spatial \nheterogeneity of vine growth\
    \ and size. The steeper slopes \nmay result in more runoff and less soil water\
    \ retention (Bril-\nlante et al. 2018), while aspects affect the amount of solar\
    \ \nradiation received by the vines (Biss 2020). In the RIP720 \nvineyard, the\
    \ different water stress levels were caused by \nrelatively short-term irrigation\
    \ treatments, thus the relation-\nships between VIs and 휓leaf were less significant\
    \ and these \nshorter stress events as noted earlier can only be determined \n\
    if thermal data are available (Knipper et al. 2019). Several \nstudies have used\
    \ multispectral and hyperspectral cameras \nthat can measure photochemical reflectance\
    \ index (PRI), \nsolar-induced fluorescence (SIF), water index (WI) to detect\
    \ \nplant water stress (Peñuelas et al. 1997; Zarco-Tejada et al. \n2012, 2013).\
    \ Adding spectral reflectance and VIs from addi-\ntional spectral and thermal\
    \ bands will further improve the \ncapability of remote monitoring water stress.\n\
    We recognize that the UAV imaging is constrained by the \nlimited payload and\
    \ processing a large data volume of super \nhigh resolution aerial imagery can\
    \ be time consuming or \ncostly, despite the availability of commercial drone\
    \ imagery \nprocessing software such as Pix4D. Therefore, the UAV \nbased approach\
    \ can be rather challenging to scale it up for \noperational water stress mapping\
    \ at a larger scale. To address \nthis scalability issue, an important next step\
    \ is to combine \nless frequent but high spatial resolution imagery from UAV \n\
    systems or satellites such as PlanetScope with more frequent \nmoderate resolution\
    \ imagery from Landsat and Sentinel \n2 satellite series (Houborg and McCabe 2018).\
    \ The data \nfusion from multiple sensors will allow for mapping vine \nwater\
    \ stress more frequently throughout the growing season. \nOne important consideration\
    \ is the spectral configuration of \ndifferent sensors. Radiometric consistency\
    \ across cameras \nFig. 9  Comparison of the \nfield-level distribution of the\

    \ \nbetween reflectance observed from different remote sens-\ning systems; or\
    \ the machine learning models need to be re-\ntrained using the imagery from different\
    \ systems.\nPotential applications for irrigation management\nBy combing UAV based\
    \ multispectral data and weather \ninformation, the unified machine learning model,\
    \ once \ntrained and validated, can estimate the grapevine water stress \nlevel\
    \ at 8 cm scale across the whole field of any vineyards \nin the region. This\
    \ approach can potentially supplement \nthe traditional ground measurements of\
    \ 휓leaf over sampled \nvines with pressure chambers, and scale up to capture the\
    \ \nwithin-field spatial heterogeneity in a timely and efficient \nway. With the\
    \ water stress level map produced with the \nmodel and remote sensing imagery,\
    \ the growers can design \nthe informed irrigation zones and manage their irrigation\
    \ \nschedule more precisely. One of the key remaining issues is \nhow quickly\
    \ one can generate these leaf water potential maps \nand make it available to\
    \ the growers.\nConclusion\nWe developed and tested the capability of UAV systems\
    \ for \nmonitoring water status in three commercial vineyards in \nCalifornia,\
    \ USA. We found that the models based on remote \nsensing only metrics cannot\
    \ be generalized across the vine-\nyards. The RF model was built to estimate 휓leaf\
    \ at 8 cm, \nusing ground measurements from all fields and all dates, \nthe corresponding\
    \ remote sensing metrics from high reso-\nlution imagery from the Micasense Rededge\
    \ multispectral \ncamera, and weather data. Our validation with independent \n\
    testing data showed that the RF full model can predict 휓leaf \nwell with a R2\
    \ of 0.778, RMSE of 0.123 MPa, and MAE \nof 0.100 MPa. The weather variables including\
    \ air temper-\nature and VPD were critical for capturing the large scale \nvariability,\
    \ i.e., across vineyards and across dates. The red \nedge band, however, provided\
    \ important information for the \nwithin field variability of 휓leaf . The 휓leaf\
    \ map produced with \nthe RF model was able to capture both temporal and spatial\
    \ \nvariability of water stress level of the vineyard, consistent \nwith irrigation\
    \ management and patterns observed from the \nground sampling. Our results demonstrated\
    \ the potential of \nthe multi-spectral UAV system for providing data-driven \n\
    information to guide precision irrigation management.\nAcknowledgements The authors\

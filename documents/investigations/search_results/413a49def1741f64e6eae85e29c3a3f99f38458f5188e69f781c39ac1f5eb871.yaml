    Ireland SECTION I. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture [4], [20], [3],
    [8], [10], [12], [19], [20], [24], [32], [34], [31], [33], [28], [30], [25], [27],
    [29], [26], [37] [38], [39], [40], is the area in which technology can be used
    to effectively manage agriculture by understanding the temporal and spatial changes
    in soil, crop, production, and management through innovative techniques. The emerging
    Information Age will significantly affect the way we conduct and teach precision
    agriculture in universities and institutes of higher education. These impacts
    of change are already being felt across disciplines and across their missions
    of education, research, and outreach. The vital role of computing and information
    technologies in precision agriculture reflects far-reaching changes across our
    society — changes that are impacting virtually every human endeavor in the field
    of agriculture. Due to this, in precision agriculture, there are great opportunities
    for discovery and innovation. There are also many challenges in accelerating pace
    of change and broadening needs of water for food. The community need to organize
    and harness its resources to effectively and efficiently overcome these challenges.
    At all strategic levels, integrated education, research, and outreach measures
    are required that address precision agriculture community’s need to acquire, manage,
    analyze, visualize, and utilize data and information to solve important cross-disciplinary
    problems and meet critical societal needs. By 2020, Cisco’s visual networking
    index [1] expects that 11.6 billion devices will be connected to the Internet.
    This number is greater than the projected population of the World (10 billion
    by 2050). The data insights from these devices will carry a $11 trillion economic
    value. There is need of innovation in diverse set of precision agriculture areas.
    From an era where only tractors, seeders, combines, harvesters, and farm machinery
    were used with very limited technology, we are foreseeing a future in which computing
    and information technologies will be integral to every piece of equipment on the
    field. Growers will routinely use computers that are millions of times more powerful,
    connected to the Cloud with ubiquitous availability of data and information, and
    have communication capability through increasingly sophisticated interfaces. Many
    billions of data points are already being generated on daily basis at large agriculturally
    farms. Virtually every agricultural area has been profoundly impacted by advances
    in computing technologies [2]. On the other hand, our academic pursuits of agricultural
    education and research have not adopted to it. Our current generation agrarian
    students will participate in the innovations of the next fifty years and witness
    changes that we can only imagine. Perhaps no arena of computing calls more upon
    our imagination than that of systems that match or exceed the abilities of human
    intelligence to utilize massive and rapidly growing data and information resources,
    apply advanced analytics to extract information and understand patterns, and arrive
    at intelligent solutions or actions in highly dynamic situations. These technologies
    are now the stuff of science fiction personified in androids and even the singularity
    of humans and machines, but they will dramatically reshape education, business,
    agriculture, health care, science, engineering, humanities, arts, entertainment,
    and other activities in ways that we cannot yet envision. In Fig. 1, the different
    components of the precision agriculture have been shown. SECTION II. Practical
    Trends and Challenges We highlight some recent practical trends and the challenges.
    Agricultural industry, governmental agencies, and growers have exceedingly critical
    needs for skills and innovations in computing and information technology. Accordingly,
    demand for computer and information technology education and university research
    has increased over decades and has exploded in recent years. The Bureau of Labor
    Statistics (BLS) in U.S Department of Labor forecasts a 12% increase in employment
    opportunities in the field of computer and information technology with new jobs
    being added through 2024 due to Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Cloud
    Computing and Cyber Security. Precision agriculture is also one of the major research
    drivers and a leader in quest for innovation. As a result, the emergence of new
    business models, services, and markets and technological advances will also contribute
    to substantial growth in GDP. Lack of training is one of the main challenges to
    adoption of precision agriculture. Other factors hindering the precision agriculture
    adoption are cost, return on investment, and lack of precision agriculture big
    data analytics [16]. Fig. 1: The different components of the precision agriculture.
    Show All SECTION III. Objectives In this section, we present some important objectives
    for integrated technology research and education in precision agriculture. The
    establishment of stakeholder engagement programs to understand how industry leaders
    perceive the adoption of precision agriculture technologies is needed. Their understanding
    and vision about technology adoption in precision agriculture will aid in eliminating
    of barriers to precision agriculture adoption. Another approach to engage farmers
    is by providing access to high speed internet connectivity. The reliable inter-net
    connectivity at affordable price will improve adoption of precision agricultural
    technology. Furthermore, it will benefit on-site data analysis of yield limiting
    factors. Through high-speed broadband connectivity to the cloud, the traffic demands
    of the novel precision agriculture applications can be met. Despite the high costs
    associated with deployment of rural broadband networks, the internet service providers
    can reap higher returns on investment helped by ubiquitous precision agriculture
    adoption in rural areas. Our academic institutions must organize to more effectively
    perform the research driving innovations in precision agriculture to educate next
    generation students to use and creatively adapt both themselves and these new
    technologies for the future, and catalyze cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines
    bridging education and research. Innovations in precision agriculture training
    are needed. The development and implantation of training programs will help to
    strengthen the technology expertise the researchers need to deal with precision
    agriculture big data analytics. As new products will span out in various farms,
    the decision making systems should be available to stakeholders at various levels,
    increasing impact and providing a problem driven environment for learning. The
    enhancement of undergraduate curriculum to include technology solutions and opportunities
    in precision agriculture is also a current need. Particularly, development of
    training materials to offer education and outreach to farmers will help in the
    areas of sustainable agricultural management systems, sustainable agriculture
    l production and management. The improved MS and PhD curriculum for precision
    agriculture will lead to growth in expertise in precision agriculture. SECTION
    IV. Effective Approaches One approach is that the diverse departments in universities
    can expand and develop education, research activities tailored to their disciplinary
    demands. By leveraging collaboration and utilizing core resources, on-going education
    and research efforts can achieve a level of success and scale that would not be
    possible with only the personnel and resources within their respective departments.
    This structured cross-disciplinary approach will also be more cost-effective in
    leveraging resources and avoiding duplication and so will most effectively surmount
    the challenges in the field. Particularly, centers to catalyze and support collaborative
    research, education precision agriculture computational analytics and informatics,
    Internet of Things (IoT) among participating units across the departments need
    to established. Moreover, a signature constellation of undergraduate and graduate
    programs in precision agriculture computational analytics and informatics, rooted
    in participating department will play a vital role in sharing an innovative interdisciplinary
    core, and collaboration on visible, cross-disciplinary projects. Industry university
    cooperative research can be conducted by forming consortiums of industry and stakeholders
    across the country to leverage viable outcome. Through the application of state-of-the-art
    approaches and technologies, and leveraging existing infrastructure, including
    advanced phenotyping and genetics, new techniques can be developed to maximize
    yield and nutrition while conserving water resources [18], [17]. Development of
    testbeds and platforms to implement and test new precision agriculture technologies
    for monitoring, planting, and harvesting through farmer/academia engagement will
    aid in technology adoption. These testbeds will also be useful in evaluation of
    in-field sensing, decision making, data science, and visual analytics solutions.
    Moreover, by targeted research development in controlling contamination of agricultural
    products during all stages of production and processing a new era can be created
    for a sustainable and healthy community. Pilot studies are also needed for innovations
    in storage and transport of grains, fruits, and vegetables to minimize loss caused
    by pests. The agriculture is becoming exceedingly vulnerable to the soil degradation,
    water scarcity, deteriorating mountain ecosystems, and more variable and intense
    weather patterns (e.g., floods, drought, frosts). However, there are major gaps
    in our understanding of changes in agriculture and how these changes will effect
    agriculture. Improved knowledge needs to be acquired to anticipate, plan, and
    adapt to these changes and to gain new grounds in agriculture. Furthermore, efforts
    are needed to develop better detection techniques for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl
    substances (PFAS), and PFAS-containing waste found in different soils. Among existing
    techniques, granular activated carbon (GAC) is a growing technology in PFAS treatment
    in water [23], [7]. However, there is a significant lack of data and procedure
    development in terms of fundamental understanding and quantification of medium
    properties. The adsorptive and destructive technologies, are considered for both
    soils and waters [9], [6]. Other remediation approaches are anion-exchange, ozofractionation,
    chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, sonolysis, soils stabilization,
    and thermal technologies [5], [15], [21], [22]. These treatment technologies are
    not best suited to provide PFAS management systems with almost real-time sensing
    data to facilitate fast decision making [14], [13]. To meet the need of practical
    approaches to manage the potential environmental impacts of PFAS, environmental
    researchers must develop and implement new technologies to enhance detection and
    control of PFAS with fewer inputs. Enhanced techniques that are more practical
    and efficient in control, treatment, destruction, and removal of PFAS in soils
    are needed. This complex and arduous task requires interdisciplinary endeavors
    that combine various environmental science disciplines to develop such tools and
    implement them in the field to achieve this purpose. The improved knowledge of
    different soil systems will contribute to the development of better underground
    sensing techniques. Lack of long term, large scale soil measurements is a major
    challenge as the existing models to predict different soil properties are developed
    using small scale testbeds and field measurements that also involves removal of
    soil from field locations for laboratory analysis. New technologies are needed
    to better understand the carbon and nitrogen cycle. To achieve this objective,
    the technology researchers and soil scientist have to play a dynamic role to develop
    advanced in-situ systems capable of measuring physical, chemical, and biological
    properties of soil in large scale fields containing different types of soil. In
    this regard, the recent advancements in the field of health and energy can be
    employed in precision agriculture. Effective and reliable soil moisture sensing
    and irrigation management techniques also depend on advances in underground sensing
    and communication technology. Major challenges in these areas are manual installation
    and removal of soil moisture sensors during pre- and post-growing seasons and
    privacy concerns of the farmers about their fields. To overcome these precision
    agriculture adoption barriers, underground IoT with long term sensing capability
    coupled with wireless underground communications and networking are needed. To
    build technology-aware, advanced precision agriculture practices, the innovation
    and automation in underground sensing and secure communications, data collection,
    analysis, and visualization will play a vital role [36], [35]. Sensors for soil
    and water quality across networked landscapes need to be developed. Moreover,
    integration of advances in precision agriculture data analytics, in-situ and remote
    sensing into working systems, indigenous and local information is required [10],
    [11]. The development and application of novel sensing and communication techniques
    for water resource conservation and enhancement of the crop yield is a major area
    in need of technology innovations. A large scale field IoT can be built using
    these wired and wireless technologies and sensing solutions. Creation of networked
    collection of existing soil type and moisture related databases will improve access
    to large scale consolidated data for decision making. SECTION V. Conclusions In
    conclusion, innovations and new knowledge are vital to enable a comprehensive
    and integrated technology approach to precision agriculture. Expertise across
    multiple domains including engineering and technology, agronomy, environmental
    sensing and monitoring, phonemics, soil fertility, entomology, data mining, machine
    learning and robotics are needed. All efforts should be made to connect expertise
    across these domains to examine important technology development and adoption
    challenges in precision agriculture. The application of the latest innovations
    in technology, sensing and communications will allow for substantial improvements
    in precision agriculture practices and management solutions. Authors Figures References

    Revised 17 Mar 2020 Accepted 06 Aug 2020 Published 07 Sept 2020 Abstract The motivation
    for this review paper came from the developing countries where the economy is
    mostly dependent on agriculture and climate conditions. Based on current conditions
    and historical records, profitability in production farming depends on making
    a right and timely operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program
    designed to maximize the productivity of agriculture by carefully tailoring the
    soil and crop management to meet the specific requirements in each field while
    preserving environmental quality. This review paper highlights the development
    of an automated irrigation system with portable wireless sensor networks and decision
    support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture
    field. Radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication,
    and microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity. The knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred
    directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in the
    world can display them through an internet-enabled device. Development of sensor-based
    application in modern agriculture makes it cost-effective and potentially productive
    and increases the efficiency through precision agriculture farming. Different
    limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed publications like the
    shortage of power in the field that can be solved by using a solar panel that
    recharges the battery at the same time using electricity. Bluetooth application
    in the agriculture sector is mainly improved by design system optimization. Problems
    related to transmission and radio range frequency can be solved by using a power
    class upgraded antenna. 1. Introduction Human civilization around the globe is
    preparing for a population explosion to hit a total of 10 billion inhabitants
    by 2050 (United Nations, 2017). It has been estimated that global food production
    must increase by least 70% over the coming years to keep pace with this growth
    [ 1– 3]. Over the years, agricultural methods have not improved much, and farmers
    still use conventional strategies based on expectations of the crop’s nutritional
    needs. Delivering the same nutrient input across the entire farm is no longer
    the best choice, as this leads to heavy fertilizer and pesticide usage, unnecessary
    water consumption, environmental degradation, and high operating costs [ 4, 5].
    Extensive irrigation consumes approximately 70% of global water [ 6]. The industrial
    and domestic sectors account for 13% and 20%, respectively, although this variation
    in percentage is considerable variation across countries. According to the Act
    1947, it defines agriculture, including livestock’s breeding, dairy farming, horticulture,
    seed growing, and fruit growing [ 7]. Agriculture aims to utilize maximum land
    and increase the profit. The agricultural sector needs to adopt smarter methods
    of farming. Innovative techniques in agriculture, such as precision farming techniques,
    help with these concerns. Precision farming is a farm management method that uses
    information technology to efficiently distribute resources and ensure that the
    crops and soil receive the exact nutrients needed at the perfect time for enhanced
    health and productivity [ 8]. In recent years, the researchers have tried to develop
    automated control irrigation systems for irrigation management by using cloud
    computing and IoT technology; IoT can be characterized as a network of independent
    objects that link and share data remotely over the Internet [ 9, 10]. The gap
    between supply and demand is rising and sets new challenges adding pressure on
    the agriculture supply chain [ 11]. Traditionally available techniques for irrigation
    are drip irrigation, ditch irrigation, sprinkler systems, and terraced systems.
    The standard irrigation practices are classified by demand increase for productivity,
    shortage of water, and poor performance for agriculture practice. These problems
    are solved by using automated irrigation systems. 1.1. Need for Automatic Irrigation
    (i) Saving energy and resources for utilizing in a precise way. (ii) Easily installation
    of the system on the field. (iii) To apply the right amount of water at the right
    time for the sake of farmer’s easiness to control farm irrigation and nursery.
    (iv) Valves are used in automated irrigation systems to turn on/off the motor.
    (v) Pump or motor can be easily operated with a sensor-based controller and no
    need for any labor to manage or monitor irrigation systems. Crop efficiency includes
    improvement in the reduction of the overwatering from the saturated soil and avoiding
    the wrong time of irrigation to save more water. A significant part of freshwater
    is consumed in the agricultural sector due to the unavailability of cost-effective
    irrigation systems [ 12– 14]. Fortunately, previous implementations of agricultural
    monitoring systems for irrigation practices were riddled with problems that prevented
    the progress of this sector. Previously, farm surveillance systems comprised of
    a wired data collection system in which a data transmission linked the sensor
    units with monitoring stations [ 13, 15, 16]. Rainfall and evapotranspiration
    is an important factor which influences the moisture of the soil in climatology
    and geography soil wetness measured by the proportion of monthly (or annual) evaporation
    and precipitation. Soil moisture daily can also be calculated by the ratio of
    daily evaporation and precipitation in the above perspective from the routine
    weather reports precipitation is directly accessible, and evaporation is derived
    from other metrological essentials [ 17]. Heterogeneous systems are used to gather
    information at a higher level; smart algorithms can be organized for evaluating
    scientific knowledge to provide an enhanced understanding of the ongoing processes
    [ 18, 19]. For sensors-based irrigation, different terminologies are used, i.e.,
    Precision Farming, Variable Rate Technology (VRT), Smart Agriculture, Global Positioning
    Service (GPS), and Site-Specific Crop Management. [ 20]. Nowadays, sensors can
    be used in the domain of human life due to its modern technology and small size.
    Due to the consequence of this technology, numerous problems associated with sensor
    networking are in research. Low memory, energy constraint, and data security are
    some of the significant issues of sensor networks in which different researchers
    in the world are trying to solve these issues [ 21, 22]. This review is proposed
    to support aggressive water management for agricultural land. It aims to explain
    the different modern and sensor-based irrigation management techniques and track
    environmental parameters in the field of agriculture and provide warnings and
    information on current conditions to field managers while saving data for future
    reference in a database, which includes information collecting using remote sensor
    collection, wireless sensor network, target controlling, and data management scheme
    as shown in Figure 1. This review paper is based on sensor-based irrigation systems
    and modern technologies in the previous works; this study will be helpful to new
    researchers in this field to get more knowledge and provide more up to date and
    fill the gap through this review study.    Figure 1  Wireless sensor network layout
    for the automated irrigation system. 2. Related Work An automatic sprinkler is
    a new irrigation technique of modern agriculture, but until now, it is not entirely
    accepted among the farmers. Mostly, it is practiced by the researchers for performing
    the experimental studies. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is conceived as a new
    concept in agricultural applies, which encouraged many scholars to accomplish
    research in this zone. Recent developments in wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies
    have enabled wired sensor systems to solve specific problems [ 23– 26]. Recent
    developments in wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have enabled wired
    sensor systems to solve particular problems [ 27– 29]. This segment is mainly
    focusing on how different researchers used WSN systems to support agricultural
    practices and irrigation. Abbas et al. have developed a smart sensor-based system
    for parks and gardens that make use of different modern sensors. In this system,
    the latest soil moisture sensors are used to sense the field moisture as well
    as different soil characteristics such as water holding capacity [ 30]. The main
    aim of this system is to calculate the time that is taken by the sensors to get
    activated and distinguished the irrigation zone. ZigBee is used to make a connection
    between sensor nodes and wireless-based stations. This system has four significant
    portions, i.e., control unit, water controller, security systems, and mobile messaging
    unit [ 31]. The primary function of the water controller is to identify the level
    of water in the field and to represent the microcontroller. Output functions of
    water sensors are to switch the microcontrollers and automatically turn on or
    turn off the pump mechanism. If the farm is submerged, then the controller is
    automatically turned on the pump that takes out additional water from the field.
    Security systems and password protection were used to control unit and pumps from
    unauthorized access. Water is being applied through proper network systems that
    involve pipes, pumps, valves, and sprinklers. Irrigation sprinklers can also be
    used for industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural purposes. Moreover,
    several studies considered sensor-based irrigation is a modern-day irrigation
    activity that is practiced in a large area under entire controlled-conditions,
    as it could eliminate the external environmental factors compared with the traditional
    irrigation activities. The GSM sensor-based irrigation control system with a gun
    sprinkler was declared in [ 32– 34] with rain gun systems operated with the automatic
    microcontroller for crops requiring a more significant amount of water in the
    field. Cell phone applications play a fundamental part in the multiple needs of
    humans. GPRS feature in the mobile phone application is used for irrigation control
    systems, but these systems are not economical and cover less range of agricultural
    land. The methods used GSM feature and the android app for sending a message to
    farmers and notify them about overirrigation and under irrigation that causes
    losses, leaching the nutrient content of soil [ 35, 36]. Satellite communication
    schemes are widely used or prefer where topography difference is significant,
    and cell phone service is not reachable [ 37, 38]. Radio systems with certified
    power (e.g., 5–10 W) with modems are also a good option but affected by topographic
    hindrance. For radiofrequency, repeater stations may become too costly when there
    is communication over a significant distance and different topography. The central
    aspect of this technology is to develop decision support systems based on field-specific
    information that exploits the chemical or applied water concentration [ 39]. Lamb
    et al. developed a system which is operated by photovoltaic irrigation to enhance
    water depletion by using temperature sensors and moisture sensors [ 40]. 2.1.
    Soil Evaporation Model [ 41, 42] For proper irrigation management, prediction
    of soil moisture plays a vital role. The Penmen method was considered to get the
    possible accurate results with a minimum error related with living grass reference
    crop. It was observed that the pan method would give us acceptable accuracy dependent
    on the position of the land. The FAO Penman–Monteith method to measure ET0 is
    shown in the following equations: where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm
    day−1), G = heat flux density of soil [MJ m−2·day−1], μ2 = wind speed at height
    of 2 m [ms−1], T = daily mean air temperature at 3 m height [°C], Rn = crop surface
    net radiation [MJ M−2 day −1], ea = actual vapor pressure [kPa], es = saturated
    vapor pressure [kPa], es-ea = deficit saturation vapors pressure [kPa], P = atmospheric
    pressure [kPa], Δ = curve of slope vapor pressure [kPa °C−1], γ = psychrometric
    constant [kPa °C−1], z = elevation above sea level [m], e0 (T) = saturation vapor
    pressure at the air temperature T [kPa], CP = specific heat at constant pressure,
    1.013 10–3 [MJ kg−10C−1], λ = latent heat of vaporization, 2.45[MJ kg−1], € = ration
    molecular weight of water vapor/day air = 0.622. The soil moisture estimation
    is mainly depending upon the evapotranspiration. The other most frequently used
    method based on extraterrestrial radioactivity and temperature to evaluate ET0
    [ 43]: where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), Tmax and Tmin = max.
    temperature and min. temperature (°C), Ra = extraterrestrial radiation (MJm−2
    day−1). Ritchie purposed another method for the estimation of ET0 [ 44] based
    on solar radiation and temperature. It is expressed as where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration
    (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum and minimum temperature (°C); and Rs = solar
    radiation (MJm−2 day−1). When An evapotranspiration measurement method was established
    on neurofuzzy (NF) inference and originated that the NF model (depended on relative
    humidity, solar radioactivity, and air temperature) shows better precision over
    the combination of air temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation [ 45]. Soil
    moisture has been predicted from the weather forecast sensors placed at the farm.
    The soil moisture evaporation depends on air relative humidity, air temperature,
    radiation, and temperature of the soil [ 46]. A sensor-based and IoT constructed
    architecture (Figure 2) has been developed for collecting, processing, and transmitting
    the different physical parameters (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil
    moisture soil temperature, and radiation) of the farmland related to weather forecast
    information for making efficient irrigation.    Figure 2  The architecture of
    the proposed system. The system comprises two main components, i.e., Wireless
    Information Unit (WIU) and Wireless Sensor Unit (WSU). The sensor units have different
    types of sensors to sense the soil temperature and soil moisture, and the main
    microcontroller received sensed data and optimized it. ZigBee is used to send
    data to WIU. Such WSN networks also added a small transmission spectrum and high
    network costs [ 47– 49]. Data acquisition structures are developed to be used
    in environmental compliance along with greenhouses or food factories and lack
    of solidity to be used outside for prolonged periods. Vishwakarma and Choudhary
    developed another option for irrigation systems operated with SMS facilities,
    and farmers received a text to mobile phones. This system incessantly observes
    the irrigation pump and electric motor and aware the farmers by sending an SMS
    to the mobile telephone representing the accessibility of power supply to the
    motor. The farmer selects to turn off and on the electric motor by sending an
    SMS to the sensor-based systems that are installed on the field, and networks
    can act according to the programming command as received in SMS; the farmers are
    also able to set the timer according to their need to turn off the motor automatically
    [ 50]. 3. Remote Sensing in Modern Irrigation Remote sensing is the latest technique
    for collecting data through different satellite sensor technologies. This technique
    involves very close examination of vast land set images and photos that are captured
    by aerial photographs which are followed by an interpretation, identification,
    and mapping of different agricultural resources and various water data that are
    connected with forest, water bodies, villages, roads, crop area, soil, and land
    types. Throughout the agricultural field, optical or visual RS is one of the most
    often exploited in remote sensing. This uses various bands, i.e., NIR and SWIR
    sensors, to collect images from Earth surfaces by reflecting features from the
    surface of the target area [ 51]. Thermal sensors are often used to measure surface
    temperature and have detected rapid response variables to track crop health and
    crop stress [ 52, 53]. Thermal remote sensing is a process of monitoring radiation
    emitted from the surface of the object and transmits it to temperature without
    creating any contact with the object. All surface objects emit radiation above
    the temperature of °K or 273°C [ 54]. The absorption intensity of each object
    depends on the temperature; the higher the temperature, the greater the intensity
    of the radiation. Thermal remote sensing provides us with substantial temperature
    and energy transfer from the earth’s surface, which is essential to assume the
    processes and responses of the landscape [ 55, 56]. For many agriculture application
    series of airborne thermal sensors, the satellite uses directly or indirectly,
    as shown in Table 1. Table 1  Satellite and airborne thermal infrared sensors
    attached to platforms. These remote sensing and agrometrological station data
    are very useful to improve the actual crop yield estimation and involve in the
    development of crop growth and yield models. Soil moisture conditions also play
    a vital role in both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Thus, monitoring the moisture
    of the soil condition status using remote sensing data would be very impressive
    and useful to judge the actual crop condition in advance and provide valuable
    suggestions to farmers for their pesticide application, water-saving irrigation,
    and postponding fertilizer. 3.1. Why Sensors in Sprinkler Irrigation Sensors are
    used in sprinkler irrigation to get information about real-time physical and environmental
    characteristics, and they are also employed to acquire feedback and have regulators
    over the current situation. The sensors accumulated information to identify the
    current object, people, location, and conditions known as context [ 57, 58]. The
    agriculture sector carries numerous requirements through sensors that are as follows:
    (i) Monitoring of distributed land (ii) Collecting soil, crop, and weather information
    (iii) Multiple crops in a signal piece of land (iv) Fertilizer and water requirement
    of different irregular lands (v) Protective solution rather than the sensitive
    solution Different sensors that are mainly used to collect the data for agricultural-related
    practices and acquisition for soil, plant, and weather are discussed in Tables
    2–4. Table 2  Sensors used for irrigation control systems in farming domains (soil
    sensors). Table 3  Sensors used for irrigation control systems in farming domains
    (leaf/plant). Table 4  Sensors used for irrigation control systems in farming
    domains (weather). 3.2. Use of Sensors in Modern Irrigation Application of sensor
    is attractive in every field of life due to the novelty of this technology and
    size reduction; the ability of the sensor is to measure the physical characteristics
    and change them in to signal for an observer. Through specific irrigation management
    techniques, producers can maximize their yield by saving a large amount of water.
    Site-specific irrigation control systems are facing many challenges nowadays in
    terms of designing software, unified combination of sensors, data interface, and
    communication protocol [ 59]. Solar panels and electric power are a significant
    consideration. Many researchers are trying to address the different issues related
    to irrigation control and interfacing sensors by using numerous approaches. Shen
    et al. developed a GSM-SMS remote autonomous control system for the greenhouse
    [ 60], which depends on PC-based dataset and linked with the base station at the
    same time. The component of the based station is an actuator, GSM module, sensors,
    and microcontroller. The GSM module plays a vital role in the base station to
    send and receive messages from central stations. Various techniques can be used
    to calculate the soil moisture (in the gravimetric and volumetric forms), which
    are further classified into modern and classical procedures for both laboratory
    and in situ measurements. The conventional techniques to calculate the moisture
    in soil include tensiometers methods, thermogravimetric, gypsum block, and calcium
    carbide neutron scattering [ 61]. While for modern techniques, different latest
    dielectric technologies and infrared moisture balance such as heat flux moisture
    sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR), capacitance and optical method, frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR), and microelectromechanical systems are used [ 62,
    63]. Radio transmission wireless systems were used to transfer soil moisture data
    from data loggers to an essential data logging site where decisions are made and
    physically improved [ 64]. Figure 3 describes the practical approaches of the
    wireless sensor network mounted on the field. In this framework, farmers can obtain
    information in real-time (soil moisture and crop growth) through SMS facility
    or some android application for their area to get better management practices
    and crop yield. By utilizing this information, farmers can get updates about the
    farmland and nursery and could be opined about when and how much water is needed
    for irrigation practices. Automatic irrigation systems or nursery irrigation systems
    permit farmers to give or supply the right time of water with the right amount.
    This system also allows the farm manager to maintain the moisture level concerning
    time. Some studies proved that if we apply the water at the right time and right
    amount, the productions can be increased up to 25% to 30% [ 65, 66].    Figure
    3  Sensor network application in field source [ 67]. 3.3. Wireless Signal Communication
    in Irrigation Systems Various designs and architectures were proposed for plug-and-play
    technology to measure the soil moisture and develop the sprinkler valve controller
    for site-specific irrigation automation and management through distributed sensor
    network. Wall et al. stated that data arrangement and control management are the
    most effective techniques to manage all the data using low-cost microcontrollers.
    However, it is challenging to set the sensing stations on the field to connect
    base stations with wires because of station maintenance, labor cost, and considerable
    distance, especially more than 10 m. Wires systems are not very much feasible
    because cables are damaged by farm equipment and animals. That is why wireless
    networks develop grate intentions nowadays and avoid many of these problems and
    provide easy replacement of broadcast stations. Different wireless technologies
    are often used in much sensor-based research work, i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and
    ZigBee [ 68]. A detailed assessment of different sensor-based technology is discussed
    in Table 5. ZigBee wireless sensors are the low-cost and lower-power-consumption
    technology that is mostly used to develop the wireless sensor network over different
    techniques. It was established in May 2003, and ISM (industrial scientific and
    medical) bands are used to operate, i.e., 2.4 GHz, globally. Table 5  Communication
    technologies in modern irrigation. For integrating sensors and actuators, there
    are some control standards for RS485 (current based) and RS232 (voltage base)
    wireless protocol that have been widely applied and well documented in some industrial
    application. Bluetooth and ZigBee (IEEE 802.11 standards) are designed for radio
    frequency of cell phone applications that require insufficient data, proper network
    security, and long battery life [ 69]. Kim et al. stated that ZigBee is a low-cost
    wireless networking system with advanced features; they provide high reliability
    due to its direct-sequence (DS/SS) and mesh networking systems. ZigBee technology
    is cheaper and reliable than Bluetooth, and it can also be used to ensure the
    integrity and to avoid interference. ZigBee not only requires deficient power
    than Bluetooth but can also transmit effectively over less distance (e.g., 30 m).
    Advanced wireless transmitters are accessible that are operated with Bluetooth
    and communicate up to 1 km. Mostly in the agriculture sector, these types of wireless
    technologies are connected to control and sense the field condition [ 70, 71].
    4. Description of the Data Acquisition System for the Specific Field A total of
    three sensors, including a air temperature and humidity sensor, a light intensity
    sensor, and a soil moisture sensor, were used for the assessment of any particular
    area to capture four environmental parameters, namely, temperature, humidity,
    surrounding light intensity, and soil moisture content. The data collection method
    provides the opportunity to assess the ecological conditions in the agricultural
    sector accurately. Also, the system’s versatility allows additional monitors,
    including a pH sensor, to estimate plant nutrients, a UV sensor to determine ultraviolet
    light intensity, greenhouse gases and pressure sensor to track the ambient air
    composition, a rain sensor is used to detect rainy weather, and a water level
    sensors used to identify flood in the region, and these are included in the system
    according to client requirement. The module was used to read the surrounding environment
    captured by the sensors and process the data, and wireless communication transmits
    the data to the cloud server over the network system. Vital information from all
    agricultural fields was gathered and processed on the cloud server, as shown in
    Figure 4. The irrigation surveillance system established for this assessment is
    cost-effective and highly interactive and can be easily adapted to any agricultural
    field using the plug-and-play technique. This system is also operated by solar
    energy, rendering individual data acquisition units entirely wireless and portable,
    thus eliminating the need for cabling for power supply and data transmission,
    leading to reduce installation, maintenance, and relocation costs.    Figure 4  Block
    diagram of the agriculture monitoring system. 4.1. On-Site and Functionality Analysis
    The sprinkler irrigation system was designed for wheat crop for an area of 1 acre.
    The total area was divided into four plots, each part consisting of a rain gun.
    The device has been tested to ensure that environmental data can be collected
    via sensors; the information can be transmitted to the IoT platform through an
    online website. The machine has been running for a few minutes to get several
    data entries. Sprinkler field has been divided into four plots, and soil moisture
    sensors have been mounted in each location. This test was conducted to ensure
    that the device can perform as required under real-world daily usage conditions.
    The prototype and layout of the data acquisition unit were switched on and staked
    into the ground of the research field, as shown in Figure 5. All four plots were
    atomized by connecting them through Wi-Fi networking. An on-site website was developed,
    which gives the current soil moisture readings of all the sensors installed in
    the field and save the recorded data. Sensor stand, board circuits, and continuous
    electric supply were managed using an uninterruptible power supply.   (a)       (a)  (b)  (c)       Figure
    5  On-site test for automated irrigation: (a) layout sketch; (b) solenoid valves,
    GSM module, and moisture sensor; (c) installed moisture sensor. The system was
    able to capture broadcast and environmental data as designed successfully. The
    light intensity sensors were also closed as the water was poured into the soil
    to simulate a change in environmental conditions. The computer was able to detect
    these changes without any problems, as shown in Figure 6. All tested fields were
    atomized once again by connecting them through a Wi-Fi network. An on-site website
    was also devolved, which gives the current soil moisture readings of all the sensors
    installed in the field and saves the recorded data. An account on Thing Speak
    was also made to make graphs of the recorded data. Sensor stand, board circuits,
    and continuous electric supply were managed using an uninterruptible power supply.
    Moreover, one point of contention during the prototype test was the wireless connectivity
    range. As this test was carried out by linking a prototype signal processing unit
    to a Wi-Fi network established by a Wi-Fi hotspot from a cell phone, the device
    would lose its connection and stop transmitting information to the IoT platform
    if it moved approximately 5 m apart from the user. This problem could be overcome
    by installing wireless access points (WAPs) throughout the field via the wireless
    local area network (WLAN) since this is the primary form of wireless connectivity
    for the full-scale implementation of the device. One WAP implementation will provide
    an enhanced wireless network range of up to 0.5 km. This system facilitated to
    improve the labor efficiency, water productivity, and water use efficiency in
    cereal crops (i.e., wheat and maize) and saved water about 44% in the case of
    a sprinkler irrigation system. It was also concluded that 20 feet border treatment
    was better treatment than other treatments as agronomic results were better for
    this treatment, and cutoff distance must be between 60 and 70 percent of total
    length. Based on wireless sensor network systems, different opportunities must
    have been created for existing application areas that require real and remote
    sensing data for observing consequences. However, these tools have possessed many
    problems that must be solved for a long-time variability of the proposed system.
    Different issues like more energy are required for operating sensors nodes, development
    issues containing communication, deployment, and protocols. The problems in wireless
    networks were discussed in the previous work [ 22, 72] and have been addressed
    to a solution [ 73, 74]. There are some possibilities that strong wind also creates
    some problem in the sensor so there should be robust fitting around the sensors
    to support the nodes. The advantages and disadvantages of (WSN) in sensor-based
    irrigation are discussed in Table 6.    Figure 6  On-site analysis data on IoT
    platform. Table 6  Advantages and disadvantages of wireless sensor network. 4.2.
    Advantages of Automated Sprinkler Irrigation The primary objective of automated
    sprinkler irrigation is to supply a minimum amount of irrigation water throughout
    the fields. Sensor-based irrigation has a significant potentiation to save water
    and increase economic efficiencies. The main advantage of this system is to reduce
    the input cost or to increase the yield for the same input. With this irrigation
    technology, the human intervention must be minimized. With the automated technology
    of irrigation, human intervention can be reduced [ 75, 76]. Some advantages of
    this innovation can be discussed as follows. 4.2.1. Water-Saving Technology Many
    researchers have been reported that the intelligence irrigation method is the
    ideal possible method of accomplishing significant water saving [ 77]. Muñoz-Carpena
    and Dukes stated that sprinkler irrigation with sensor applications could improved
    the water efficiency up to 80–90% as against 40–45% in the surface irrigation
    method [ 78]. Blomquist et al. [ 62] concluded that 16% of water could be saved
    in this irrigation practice. 4.2.2. System Cost The irrigation system is developed
    with the module design, which helped a lot to reduce the cost. The wireless sensor
    node and actuator node were about 30 US dollars, and the portable controller was
    around $100. The total cost to build up a wireless field irrigation system depended
    on the planting area, and for a case of 5000 m2, it was approximately $500 in
    terms of hardware cost. 4.2.3. Profit and Yield Proper timing of irrigation is
    stated to be a critical factor in production while delaying irrigation can result
    in losses of between US$ 62/ha and US$ 300/ha. [ 79]. El-Kader and El-Basioni
    conducted an experiment on [ 67] potato yield measured in Egypt using sensor-based
    network technology. It has been confirmed that yields have improved, and a loss
    of 2 billion pounds has been recovered in a year. Due to these reasons, the quality
    of water used is reduced and the distribution of water is not optimized. Farmers
    irrigate their fields based on their traditional information without worrying
    about soil moisture levels, soil quality, crop water requirements, and weather
    forecasting. 4.3. Control Options of Sprinkler Mechanism During irrigation, the
    event control system is responsible for regulating the speed of sprinkler systems
    multiple times and also moves the sprinkler position at 360° of the field, where
    the rate will be changed and decision about more lees or no irrigation water is
    taken. This phenomenon would be used where different crops are planted in the
    same field [ 80, 81]. A series of the on-off cycle can be used to accomplish the
    water depth application for the individual sprinkler control system [ 82, 83].
    Adjusting the traveling speed of the center pivot sprinkler system is the most
    basic method to measure the water depth against field topographic, soil condition,
    and different crops. The primary function of center pivot systems is to irrigate
    the land from one point in a circle and work on the different topography regions
    having a range in soil textures present under a single machine. So that these
    factors are the main reasons to use the controller to manage the water application
    in the field based upon the need. Site-specific irrigation and variable rate irrigation
    are the main terms that describe the water applications devises in order to maximize
    the yield and economical value for irrigation water applied through different
    moving systems [ 84, 85]. Chavez et al. reported that, for better performance
    of remote irrigation systems, control and monitoring systems are fixed on two
    different lined moves. A series of in-field and onboard wireless sensor networks
    are used to verify the precision irrigation systems with high accuracy. Separate
    nozzle regulators were pounded according to sanction maps [ 86, 87]. Various manifolds
    attached with different sizes of sprinkler nozzles should be used for accomplishing
    and controlling irrigation water application depth to fluctuate water and nitrogen
    application [ 88, 89]. Usually, open solenoids were attached with systems to allow
    the insurance to supply the irrigation water even when control systems failed.
    For controlling irrigation water application, a variable flow sprinkler was developed
    by King and Kincaid [ 90] and Liu et al. [ 91]. It used the activated pin, which
    is operated mechanically to regulate the orifice area of nozzle and mainly it
    depends on operating pressure, and the flow rate of the sprinkler is adjusted
    within the range of 35% to 100%. Hydraulic or electric actuators were used to
    control the pin. The main problem is that the droplet size distribution and the
    wetted pattern are changed with flow rate and create a uniformity issue with overlapping
    of the sprinkler pattern [ 92, 93]. 2-3 manifolds were used in these systems,
    which serve to maintain the depth of water and water application rate. 5. Summary
    and Conclusion The objective of this research work was to highlight the development
    of improved agricultural monitoring systems that address problems of existing
    plans, including price, availability, and outdoor accessibility. A simple, low-cost,
    sustainable agricultural control system that is extremely customizable and reliable
    for outdoor use, self-powered to reduce the need for long power supply cables,
    while providing better functionality that helps to reduce the agricultural burden
    and promotes crop yields and income, has been developed. In semiarid regions of
    emerging countries, small farmers and marginal farmers (who have land b/w 4 and
    6 hectares) are facing many problems regarding powered irrigation. Most of the
    time, they are relying on seasonal precipitation for their productivity. The data
    analysis unit composed of sensors and integrated circuits may successfully capture
    the physiological conditions such as temperature, humidity, light density, and
    soil water content. These data are vital for field managers to manage resources,
    develop predictive crop growth models, and automate farm machinery. This contributes
    to successful agriculture activities, and resource use decreased the operational
    costs and workloads and increased the crop productivity. The WSN system built
    in this study offers an enhanced monitoring range. The intelligent sensor-based
    irrigation system work has been discussed in this review paper, controlling the
    different irrigation management practices by sensing different agriculture parameters
    such as soil moisture, soil pH, humidity, and temperature. These systems allow
    farmers to monitor and control their farmland with user friendly mobile applications.
    The sensor-based irrigation protects water pumps against any harmful damages by
    controlling and monitoring water pressure and input voltage. Demands for sensor-based
    irrigation increase day by day and have a substantial future scope. It is time-saving
    and also removes the human error by controlling soil moisture levels. The development
    of sensor-based applications in agriculture makes it possible to increase the
    productivity, efficiency, and profitability through precision agriculture farming.

    Get rights and content Highlights • We developed a decision support system integrated
    with a wireless sensor network. • We developed and field-tested seven irrigation
    scheduling algorithms for drip-irrigated apples. • We used the time-temperature
    threshold (TTT) method in apple trees for the first time. • The thermal-based
    treatments competed well with neutron probe (NP). • Thermal/weather-based irrigation
    scheduling reduced applied water by about 70% compared with conventional irrigation.
    Abstract Seven irrigation scheduling algorithms and an automatic control system
    along with a wireless network of soil, thermal and weather sensors were developed
    and assessed in Prosser, WA in the growing season of 2013. The system was comprised
    of six wireless sensor and valve actuating nodes installed across an apple orchard,
    a central base station made up of a transceiver connected to a laptop, and a graphical
    user interface (GUI). The irrigation algorithms/treatments included the time-temperature
    threshold (TTT), crop water stress index with dynamic threshold (CWSI), soil-based
    using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), weather-based using a temperature-only-based
    evapotranspiration (ET) model and soil water balance (WB), a combination of SOIL
    and WB (SL + WB), a conventional irrigation practice used in the region (CNTRL),
    and soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark. Different treatments were
    compared based on the total irrigation water (It) applied during the season. They
    were also compared based on simplicity and expense for a grower to implement.
    Soil water content (θs) and stem water potential (ψstem) were monitored in a number
    of treatment plots. The total applied water for CNTRL was significantly higher
    than all other treatments (p < 0.001). The thermal-based TTT and CWSI treatments
    applied the same amount of water as NP and WB (p < 0.001). CWSI and TTT substantially
    reduced water applied (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range.
    In addition, θs in the treatment plots of TTT and CWSI did not exceed the maximum
    allowed deficit recommended for apple trees (MAD of 50%) showing a strong agreement
    with NP. The SOIL and SL + WB treatments resulted in tangible under-irrigation
    as leaf drop, decreased leaf turgidity, growth reduction and abnormally small
    fruits were seen. Among all the strategies, WB seemed to bear the characteristics
    of being economical, easy to implement and fairly accurate. Our preliminary results
    also support the use of wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management
    of drip-irrigated apple trees. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    method can lead to increased profit and water savings for farmers, reduced environmental
    impacts and sustainable agriculture (Smith et al., 1996). Proper management of
    irrigation water to maintain balanced soil water content is crucial for health
    and productivity of apple trees (Black et al., 2008). To date, research has offered
    a large number of approaches to detect water stress, compute crop water needs,
    and automatically schedule irrigation (Al-Kaisi et al., 1997, Orta et al., 2003,
    Jones, 2004, Farahani et al., 2007, Vellidis et al., 2008, McCready et al., 2009,
    Ko and Piccinni, 2009, Migliaccio et al., 2010, Romero et al., 2012). Irrigation
    scheduling approaches may be grouped into three main categories (Zhang and Pierce,
    2013): (i) monitoring of soil water status (soil-based), (ii) soil water balance
    calculations using weather information (weather-based), and (iii) sensing of crop
    water stress (plant-based). Automation of irrigation has been evaluated in a number
    of row plants including tomato, onion and bell pepper using soil sensors measuring
    tension (Thompson et al., 2007, Enciso et al., 2009) or volumetric water content
    (Zotarelli et al., 2009). Vellidis et al. (2008) developed and evaluated a real-time,
    smart soil moisture and temperature sensor array prototype for scheduling irrigation
    in cotton. Romero et al. (2012) reported that the approach of combining weather
    data with soil moisture signal could increase irrigation efficiency in almond
    trees. Tensiometers have been used by Meron et al. (2001) as a feedback to manage
    irrigation of apple trees. Soil water tension sensors provide a direct measure
    of plant water status (Pedro Vaza et al., 2013). Watermark™ sensors (Irrometer
    Co., Riverside, CA) have been identified as good indicators of irrigation start
    and stop (Leib and Matthews, 1999); however, sensor accuracy is contingent to
    site-specific calibration (Varble and Chávez, 2011). The calibration need of individual
    sensors can make the use of Watermark™ sensors tedious and unattractive to most
    farmers, thus very often they are used with only factory calibration. Neutron
    probe is a scientific-based method for precise measurement of soil water content
    and has shown to be a reliable reference for other irrigation scheduling techniques
    (Evett et al., 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b). How change in weather parameters
    can affect plant water needs can be predicted using an evapotranspiration (ET)
    model. Frequently used ET models are the Penman-Monteith (PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) equations. The Hargreaves model requires
    fewer data than the PM model and can provide estimations of ET using air temperature
    as sole input (Allen et al., 1998). The most common approach to estimate actual
    water use of apple trees (ETc) is to multiply the reference ET (ETr) by a crop-specific
    coefficient (Kc) (Lakso, 2003). Osroosh et al., 2014, Osroosh et al., 2015a developed
    models based on infrared thermometry and the energy budget of a single apple leaf
    to estimate the actual and potential transpiration of whole tree. However, like
    the PM model, they require a wide range of input data. The weather-based irrigation
    scheduling has a long history of implementation using commercial irrigation controllers
    for both research (Davis et al., 2009, Davis and Dukes, 2010, Cardenas-Lailhacar
    et al., 2008, Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2010) and commercial applications; however,
    few research studies have investigated its application on fruit trees. In a study
    by Kisekka et al. (2010), ET-based irrigation scheduling saved significant quantities
    of water compared with a calendar-based grower’s approach of irrigation in a Carambola
    Orchard. Leaf water potential measured using a pressure bomb has long been used
    to monitor crop water status and as trigger point for irrigation (Stegman et al.,
    1976, Turner, 1988). However, this method is very tedious, labor-intensive and
    not appropriate for automation. The use of infrared temperature of plant canopies
    along with a number of ancillary meteorological measurements is an alternative
    plant-based approach (Cohen et al., 2005). Irrigation scheduling systems based
    on a feedback from crop have shown to outperform scientific-based irrigation scheduling
    using the neutron probe in row crops (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015). Various thermal-based
    scheduling algorithms have been developed such as the crop water stress index
    (CWSI: Jackson et al., 1981, Jackson et al., 1988) and time-temperature threshold
    (TTT: Wanjura et al., 1992, Wanjura et al., 1995, Upchurch et al., 1996). CWSI
    compares the measured canopy-air temperature differences (ΔTm) with theoretically/empirically
    determined temperature differences of a non-transpiring (ΔTu) and well-watered
    (ΔTl) plants as defined by Jackson et al. (1981): (1) Different varieties of the
    CWSI have been suggested over the years including the CWSI and time threshold
    (CWSI-TT: O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), integrated CWSI (iCWSI: O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2013) and CWSI-DT (Osroosh et al., 2015b). CWSI has been rarely used to
    schedule irrigation in trees (Osroosh et al., 2015b) and more often to detect
    water stress (Testi et al., 2008, Wang and Gartung, 2010, Paltineanu et al., 2013,
    Agam et al., 2013, Berni et al., 2009, Osroosh et al., 2016). The CWSI might be
    affected by many unwanted factors such as dust or passing clouds (O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2012b); however, it has proven to be reliable if integrated into a robust
    algorithm accounting for these temporary conditions (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The
    TTT method, also patented as “BIOTIC”, requires a “time threshold” and a “temperature
    threshold.” The temperature threshold is the optimal leaf temperature for enzyme
    activity determined in lab. The time threshold is the accumulated time above the
    temperature threshold for non-stressed crop in specific climate calculated using
    experimental/simulated data. O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) carried out automatic
    irrigation experiments on cotton using the TTT algorithm in Texas. Peters and
    Evett (2008) used the TTT method to automate water delivery to the center pivot-irrigated
    plots of soybean. To our knowledge, no reports are available on irrigation scheduling
    of woody fruit trees using the TTT approach. Nowadays, some growers rely on wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) to obtain information remotely on a wide range of parameters
    but rarely to automatically schedule irrigations (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013).
    In research, WSNs have been employed to collect weather, soil and environmental
    information using soil moisture, temperature, or agro-meteorological sensors,
    and to control a variety of irrigation systems (Coates and Delwiche, 2009, Kim
    and Evans, 2009, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Ojha et al., 2015). A site-specific
    irrigation control system uses a WSN to monitor field variables and minimize the
    spatial variability of irrigation. In order to make the wireless technology available
    to growers, Coates et al. (2013) developed and integrated a valve actuation system
    with a commercially-available WSN. Both wired and wireless sensors network systems
    have been used in automatic irrigation scheduling (Peters and Evett, 2008, O’Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012a, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2013) with
    the later being more flexible, convenient and economical. Besides reducing labor
    requirements, automatic software scheduling tools are necessary for optimizing
    the amount of irrigation water in response to crop development and type, and environmental
    conditions (Casadesús et al., 2012). The software must be user-friendly and allow
    for simple management of the WSN and irrigation valves by growers (Kim and Evans,
    2009). Various computer software packages have been developed for monitoring soil
    parameters and irrigation scheduling over a wide range of irrigation systems (Stone
    et al., 1985, Hess, 1996, Abreu and Pereira, 2002). Kim and Evans (2009) developed
    decision support software to collect information from a WSN and control a site-specific
    linear-move irrigation system on a malting barley field. The aforementioned approaches
    have been widely used in research; however, farmers are still far from adopting
    them. They are eager to see reliable irrigation scheduling methods which are affordable
    and not necessarily complicated, yet accurate and suit their field and crop conditions.
    Our specific objectives here were to (i) develop fully automatic irrigation supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, and wireless sensor network, (ii)
    develop computer soil-, plant-, and weather-based algorithms for scheduling irrigation
    of drip-irrigated apple trees, (iii) collect information on these various strategies
    in terms of total amount of water applied, root zone soil water status (content/tension),
    plant water status (stem water potential), cost and simplicity. This paper emphasizes
    on the plant-based approaches and presents the results of a preliminary field
    evaluation in a growing season in the arid region of central Washington. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and irrigation system The study was conducted in a
    Fuji apple orchard on the Roza Farm of the Washington State University Irrigated
    Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser, WA (46.26°N, 119.74°W)
    during the irrigation period of 2013. The region was semi-arid with an average
    annual precipitation of 217 mm and little summer rainfall. The site’s soil was
    Warden Silt Loam, ∼1-m deep limited by a rocky layer to shallower depths in some
    plots. The average volumetric water content at field capacity, θFC, was 0.33 m3
    m−3 measured as drained soil water content after a heavy irrigation event. The
    trees were spaced 4 m (row spacing) by 2.5 m (tree spacing) apart. In 2007, the
    trees were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler irrigation system (Hurricane, NaanDanJain
    Irrigation Ltd., Post Naan, Israel) with water emitters of 27 L h−1 spaced at
    2.5 m intervals. In 2013, the irrigation system was drip tubing with two lines
    of pressure compensating laterals (∼0.6 m apart) of in-line 2.0 L h−1 (equivalent
    to 1.1 mm h−1) drippers (BlueLine® PC, The Toro Company, El Cajon, CA), spaced
    at 91.4 cm intervals along the laterals. In 2013, the irrigation system was configured
    for twenty-one irrigation zones (discussed later) and flow to each zone was controlled
    with a latching solenoid valve (LSV) (Irritrol, Riverside, CA). A conservative
    value of 85% was assumed for the efficiency of the irrigation system. 2.2. Wireless
    control and monitoring system A wireless control and monitoring system was developed
    to take measurements from in-field sensors and control the on/off time of LSVs
    to create zone-specific irrigation rates in the orchard (Fig. 1). The system was
    comprised of two main components: (1) central base station (master) including
    a laptop computer and graphical user interface (GUI), and (2) six slave wireless
    nodes (sensing and valve actuation stations). The laptop was located in a room
    only 50 m far from the field. A laptop cooling pad and a backup battery were used
    to cope with room’s high temperature during the hot summer and unexpected power
    blackouts, respectively. The base station also consisted of a 900 MHz spread spectrum
    radio (model RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) to communicate with the nodes,
    and a USB mobile broadband stick (model DataJack, Inc., Dallas, TX) to provide
    internet access. Irrigation control was managed by the base station using the
    GUI developed by the authors (discussed later). Download : Download high-res image

    control and monitoring system: a typical wireless node (a), base laptop and graphical
    user interface (GUI) (b), and weather station (c). The GUI was accessed by the
    office computer using the Teamviewer software (d). A sensing and valve actuating
    node included all or some of the following sensors and components: CR10(X) datalogger,
    solar panel, battery, Watermark™ sensors, infrared thermometers (IRTs), shielded
    air temperature probe (Air Temp), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (RF), H-bridge
    and latching solenoid valve (LSV). The base control was made up of a laptop computer,
    dongle (USB modem) and RF. A wireless node was made up of a datalogger (model
    CR10(X), Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), 900 MHz spread spectrum radio (model
    RF401, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) with 3 dBi omni-directional rubber-duck
    antenna (L-COM Inc., North Andover, MA) to transmit data to and receive control
    signals from the base, 10 W solar panel (model SYP105, Instapark Co., Santa Fe
    Springs, CA) including voltage regulator, and 12 V, 7 Ah sealed lead acid battery.
    Each node controlled up to four LSVs operated by two L298 dual H-bridge motor
    drives (Robotshop Inc., Mirabel, Quebec). Nodes were also taking readings from
    a number of in-field sensors including granular matrix sensors (model Watermark
    200SS, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA), a soil temperature sensor (Model 107, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), shielded air temperature sensors (model 109, Campbell
    Scientific, Logan, UT), and industrial thermocouple infrared thermometers (model
    IRT/c.2: Type J, Exergen, Watertown, MA) with a field view of 35° and ±0.6 °C
    absolute accuracy. Depending on its location in the orchard, a node was comprised
    of all or only some of the aforementioned sensors. The furthest sensing and valve
    actuating station/node was located about 150 m far from the central base radio.
    The in-field sensors were scanned/sampled by the node dataloggers every 5 s and
    averaged every 15 min. The collected data by the nodes were then retrieved by
    the GUI every 15 min and time stamped. 2.3. Sensor installation and field measurements
    The air temperature probes were installed at a height of 2 m (in-line with trees).
    It is known that the rooting depth of a mature apple tree is about 70–90 cm (Atkinson,
    1980) and soil water content measurements should take place from about 10 (cultivation
    depth) to 60 cm (0.7 times effective depth of rooting) (Black et al., 2008). Taking
    this into consideration, the soil temperature probe and Watermark™ sensors were
    installed horizontally at a depth of 30 cm placed between the drip tubing laterals
    about ∼1.25 m from tree trunk. The Watermark™ sensors were soaked in water for
    two days and then installed in a soil wetted to near saturation. All the sensors
    were installed at the center of plots. The near real-time agro-meteorological
    data (air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall)
    measured at Roza weather station (located about 0.5 km away from the orchard)
    was pulled from the Washington State AgWeatherNet website. This data was used
    to calculate daily ETr and provided the supplementary measurements for the CWSI
    and TTT algorithms (discussed later). Midday Stem water potential (Ψstem) was
    measured with a pressure bomb (model 615, PMS Instrument Co., Albany, OR) once
    per week between 13:00 and 15:00. A total of six Ψstem readings (two readings
    per zone/plot per sampling day) were averaged to calculate mean Ψstem corresponding
    to a treatment. Soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe (503DR Hydroprobe, Campbell Pacific Nuclear, Concord, CA) on a weekly basis.
    Soil moisture and Ψstem measurements took place in the plots under the plant-based
    treatments (CWSI and TTT). An irrigation treatment was managed using the neutron
    probe (discussed later). The IRT installation methods, neutron probe calibration,
    and Ψstem measurement procedure were similar to those described by Osroosh et
    al. (2015b). 2.4. Irrigation scheduling algorithms The computer algorithms required
    for implementing seven different irrigation treatments were developed based on
    main plant-, soil- and weather-based irrigation scheduling approaches and included
    feedback and feed-forward control strategies. The irrigation scheduling treatments
    were (1) a soil water budget model using a temperature-only-based ET equation
    (WB), (2) Watermark™ soil water tension sensor (SOIL), (3) a combination of WB
    and SOIL algorithms (SL + WB), (4) the scientific-based method of using neutron
    probe (NP), (5) Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT), (6) Canopy
    temperature signal and the CWSI-DT method (CWSI), and (7) conventional irrigation
    scheduling method in the region (CNTRL). All the strategies were completely automatic
    except for NP in which soil moisture data collected manually. The main required
    inputs to the algorithms were canopy temperature (infrared) to determine crop
    water status, soil water tension to measure soil water availability, and meteorological
    data to estimate daily water needs using ET model and to calculate theoretical
    CWSI. These algorithm are described in the following paragraphs. 2.4.1. Soil water
    budget model and a temperature-only-based ET equation (WB) The algorithm was established
    on a simple soil water balance (Dukes et al., 2009) and daily estimations of reference
    ET (ETr) using the Hargreaves model (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). Reference ET
    was adjusted by local crop coefficients (Kc; Karimi et al., 2013) interpolated
    for daily values. Daily (net) irrigation water depth (Id, mm) was calculated as
    the following: (2) where Re is effective rainfall, and ETc is the crop ET (ETc
    = KcETr), all in units of mm. ETc was determined at midnight using 24-h air temperature
    data obtained from sensors installed in the orchard. For simplification, the effective
    rainfall was assumed to be equal to the amount of rainfall from the nearby weather
    station. The difference between soil water content at the beginning of the season
    (θi) and soil water content at field capacity (θFC) was added to the irrigation
    depth in the first irrigation event. ET was calculated using the FAO-56 Hargreaves
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). Twenty years worth of historical weather data and
    the ASCE Standardized PM equation (Allen et al., 2005) were used to calibrate
    the Hargreaves model for the region. Given that the drip system had a very low
    discharge rate, a threshold (Ith) was set for irrigation depth. This guaranteed
    the amount of water applied was enough to wet the whole root zone and yet avoid
    deep percolation. The irrigation water depth per application day was calculated
    according to the following model: (3) The accumulated depth over several consecutive
    days had to exceed the threshold in order for the system to schedule an irrigation
    event. 2.4.2. Soil-based irrigation using Watermark™ sensor (SOIL) This irrigation
    scheduling algorithm (Fig. 2a) was developed based on soil water potential readings
    from a Watermark™ sensor (one sensor per plot), and dry (50% depletion) and wet
    (field capacity) thresholds of −80 and −30 kPa, respectively, recommended for
    the soil type (Black et al., 2008). The field soil was assumed to be homogenous.
    Previous studies in a drip-irrigated soil have shown that the overall water status
    can be reliably extracted from single spot measurements (Rolston et al., 1991).
    An irrigation event was automatically scheduled whenever soil water potential
    exceeded the dry threshold and stopped if it reached the wet threshold. Therefore,
    the amount of applied water was dependent on the time when the wet threshold was
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Soil-based irrigation scheduling algorithm (SOIL) (a), and combined
    Watermark™ and water budget irrigation scheduling algorithm (SL + WB) (b). Varble
    and Chávez (2011) showed that diurnal soil temperature fluctuations could impact
    readings of Watermark™ sensor. A non-linear temperature compensation formula (Thompson
    and Armstrong, 1987) was applied to resistivity readings as the following: (4)
    where Rs is the measured resistance (kΩ), Ts is the soil temperature (°C), and
    PSW is the soil water potential (kPa). We did not field-calibrate the sensors
    for the soil type to comply with the common approach and ease the use of the sensors.
    2.4.3. Combination of WB and SOIL (SL + WB) This algorithm was the combination
    of the WB and SOIL algorithms similar to the algorithm proposed by Casadesús et
    al. (2012). SL + WB combines a compensating mechanism (feedback control) based
    on soil sensor readings and an estimation of water demand by a water balance method
    (feed-forward control) (Fig. 2b). SL + WB used soil water tension data to correct
    the ET model prediction of water consumption. An irrigation event was scheduled
    based on Eq. (2) and stopped whenever a soil tension of −30 kPa (wet threshold)
    was detected. 2.4.4. Canopy temperature signal and the TTT method (TTT) The TTT
    algorithm described in Evett et al. (1996) and examined in DeJonge et al. (2015)
    was the basis for the computer algorithm evaluated here. To determine the temperature
    threshold (Ttemp, °C), leaf samples were collected and sent in sealed refrigerated
    envelop to a lab in Lubbock, TX, where enzyme assays performed. The value of time
    threshold (Ttime, min) was obtained from canopy temperature and meteorological
    measurements collected over well-irrigated apple trees in 2007 in the same orchard.
    The accumulated time (t24) during 24 h was calculated as the following: (5) where
    Tm is the canopy temperature (°C) in minute m, and Ttemp is the temperature threshold.
    If t24 > Ttime then an irrigation signal was generated. The values of t24 was
    reset to 0 every day at midnight. The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as twice the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 2 × ETc) in June and July (twice
    the peak crop water use), enough to wet the root zone at the highest ET rate in
    the region while avoiding deep percolation (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). 2.4.5.
    Canopy temperature signal with the crop water stress index (CWSI) The CWSI algorithm
    relied on a theoretical CWSI and a dynamic threshold. The theoretical lower and
    upper boundaries of the CWSI were calculated using biophysical models thoroughly
    detailed by Osroosh et al. (2015b). The net irrigation depth (I) was calculated
    as three times the average crop evapotranspiration (I = 3 × ETc) in June and July.
    This computer algorithm (called CWSI-DT) and its field evaluation results are
    also described in Osroosh et al. (2015b). Here, the results from the original
    experiment were compared with the rest of the approaches. 2.4.6. Scientific-based
    method of measuring soil moisture using neutron probe (NP) The NP treatment was
    assumed to represent the best irrigation scheduling practice by an advanced farmer.
    In this approach, soil water content was measured with a field-calibrated neutron
    probe on a weekly basis. Using the soil moisture readings, soil water deficit
    (SWD) to field capacity was calculated and irrigation was scheduled. The soil
    water depletion under the NP treatment was never allowed to exceed a maximum allowed
    depletion (MAD of 50%) recommended for apple trees (Allen et al., 1998). The net
    irrigation depth was calculated as I = d × [θFC − θS], where d is the rooting
    depth (d = 0.6 m), and θs is the average volumetric soil water content for d.
    Manual neutron probe readings (raw values) were entered into the GUI right after
    field measurements every Wednesday. Irrigation was automatically schdeuled based
    on the entered reading for following day. 2.4.7. Conventional irrigation scheduling
    in the region (CNTRL) In addition to the precision algorithms described, water
    delivery to a number of zones was managed using the conventional irrigation scheduling
    method of apple trees in the region. The CNTRL algorithm (Fig. 3) was designed
    to mimic the growers’ approach of using the calendar (irrigation events on specific
    days of week) and weather conditions (low, high air temperature thresholds). In
    the CNTRL algorithm, any air temperature between the maximum (TMax) and minimum
    (Tmin) thresholds would have resulted in applying Ib = 63 mm of water. If air
    temperature exceeded the maximum threshold (TMax = 32 °C) the amount of irrigation
    water would be doubled (I = 2 × Ib). If air temperature was below the minimum
    threshold (Tmin = 21 °C), the trees would receive half the usual amount of water
    (I = 0.5 × Ib). Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download : Download

    (CNTRL). I is the amount of irrigation water applied, and Ib is the base amount
    of water which was doubled or halved depending on minimum (Tmin) and maximum (TMax)
    air temperature thresholds. 2.5. Graphical user interface A Windows-based GUI
    was developed in Microsoft VB.Net (V.2010, Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA) to manage
    and control the irrigation system and wireless nodes. Embedded routines in CoraScript
    (V.1.1.9.8, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) were used to send command signals
    to the six slave nodes/dataloggers. LoggerNet (V.3.5, Campbell Scientific, Logan,
    UT) automatically downloaded data from the nodes every 15 min and populated a
    database on the laptop. The recorded data was then managed by the GUI. Fig. 4
    shows a task flowchart of systems’ software and firmware components and their
    relationship. Instead of wireless communication between the field and office computers,
    Teamviewer (V.8, TeamViewer Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) was used to remotely
    access the GUI in the field. Download : Download high-res image (588KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Flowchart displaying the routines performed
    by the software (LN and GUI) and firmware (Node) components of the control and
    monitoring system. The node firmware was responsible for scanning the sensors
    and sending the collected data to the base. LoggerNet (LN) regularly retrieved
    data from the nodes and recorded them in a file. The GUI used this data to run
    the irrigation algorithms, and make irrigation control decision. The GUI has a
    tabular design and comprises several tabs including: (1) a “Blocks” tab for displaying
    raw real-time data from the in-field sensors and valves on/off status, (2) a tab
    for showing real-time weather data (“Roza”), and (3) a tab for monitoring the
    commands sent out and program codes in action (“Console”). Fig. 5 shows a screenshot
    of the “Blocks” tab. The rest of the tabs were dedicated to system settings, crop
    and soil properties, sensor calibration parameters, and entering manual field
    measurements into the GUI. The GUI was capable of running in three main functioning
    modes: simulation, automatic irrigation and manual irrigation. The simulation
    and manual modes were used for the purpose of testing the system’s hardware and
    software. The simulation mode was added mainly to test the internal functions
    without having to operate the hardware. The manual mode, on the other hand, allowed
    for testing and tuning the hardware more easily. Download : Download high-res

    tab of the graphical user interface. In this tab, sensor readings taken by the
    in-field sensors and remaining irrigation time are displayed in real-time. The
    values were updated every 15 min. The GUI collected data from the sensor nodes,
    downloaded weather data from the nearby weather station, and provided a real-time
    display of the measurements in individual zones regardless of the node collecting
    them. The remaining irrigation time corresponding to each sensor/plot was displayed
    next to the sensor’s name. The GUI ran the irrigation scheduling algorithms (WB,
    SOIL, SL + WB, TTT, CWSI, NP and CTNRL) every day at midnight, and automatically
    made decisions for scheduling irrigation events for twenty-one individual zones
    within the orchard. It sent control signals to the individual data-loggers which
    opened or closed latching solenoid valves to turn the water on and off to each
    block of trees. The software also allowed for manual control of individual zones.
    The data recorded in the database by LoggerNet were automatically pulled by the
    GUI and used to execute the algorithms in parallel everyday at midnight. This
    led to generating irrigation schedules for 10:30 AM of following day. The exceptions
    were the CNTRL and NP algorithms which were, respectively, run only on Mondays
    and Wednesdays as depicted in the flowchart in Fig. 4. The decision support process
    for the SOIL and SL + WB algorithms was slightly different as a continuous monitoring
    of feedback from the in-field Watermark™ sensors (every 15 min) was required to
    determine the end of irrigation event. LoggerNet was responsible for handling
    wireless communication errors and retries. The GUI monitored dataloggers battery
    voltage levels, handled coding errors and sent alert and digestion emails to the
    user. The system routinely logged irrigation events and reported the start/stop
    time of irrigations via email to the user. Due to possible exposure of in-field
    sensors to malfunction and disturbances, sensor-specific routines automatically
    analyzed the data for any signs of failure or anomalies such as abnormally high
    or low values beyond the expected range for a variable and negative/erroneous
    sensor readings. Noise or temporary abnormal changes in values were handled by
    the software and those of serious nature were reported back to the user via email.
    Besides the software error handling, the status of the wireless network was checked
    by the user regularly. 2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis The seven
    irrigation treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with
    three replications/blocks, each plot consisting of three rows of 6 trees (21 management
    zones). The trees at the center of the plots were used for measurement purpose.
    The plots were also observed for tree health and difference in the size and quality
    of apple fruits. The statistical analysis methods included the standard error
    of the mean (SE of Mean), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SigmaPlot (V.11.0,
    Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) to test for difference among the treatments
    in terms of applied irrigation water (mm season−1). To conduct multiple comparisons
    of the means, the Bonferroni t-test was employed (at p = 0.05). 3. Results and
    discussion During the 2007 growing season when the time threshold for TTT was
    determined, maximum daily evapotranspiration (ETMax), total applied irrigation
    water (It), total rainfall (May–September), and total irrigation days (dt) were
    calculated to be 9.7 mm d−1, 1077  , 32 mm and 110 d, respectively. The theoretical
    temperature threshold returned by the lab was 10 °C and the corresponding time
    threshold to this value was 1035 min. Considering the low value determined by
    the lab, a range of time threshold (Ttime) and temperature threshold (Ttemp) values
    were plotted against each other. The temperature threshold was then chosen to
    be 22.2 °C, and an irrigation event ( ) was scheduled following a day when canopy
    temperature exceeded Ttemp = 22.2 °C for more than 225 min. The rainfall totaled
    91 mm from May through September of 2013 most of which (77 mm) occurred in May
    and July. The 2013 growing season was relatively warmer compared to the 2007 growing
    period with greater daily mean temperatures, ETr values (Table 1) and ETMax of
    14.0 . Considerable amount of rainfall received during May and June, a number
    of manual irrigation events, and presence of a perched water table in the study
    site led to the availability of enough moisture in the root zone until June (θs
    > θMAD = soil moisture at MAD). As a result, the automatic irrigation system did
    not become operational until the soil water profile reached a defined irrigation
    trigger point. The wireless control system was configured and tested during March,
    April and May, and automatically managed the water delivery to the plots during
    the rest of the season. The number of automatic irrigation days was less than
    100 d for most of the treatments. Table 1. Climatic conditions for the 2007 and

    water The ANOVA test revealed that the difference in the mean values among the
    seven irrigation treatments was significant (p < 0.001). A comparison of the treatments
    in terms of total irrigation water applied can be found in Table 2. The applied
    water for CNTRL was significantly higher than all other treatments with a value
    of 1359 mm. This was over three times (340%) the amount of water applied by NP
    (401 mm). On the other hand, SOIL resulted in the lowest mean applied water (214
    mm) which was 53% of the amount delivered by NP. WB, CWSI and TTT applied 469,
    408 and 436 mm of water, respectively (no significant difference: p = 1), which
    accounted for slightly more than 100% of water applied by NP and resulted in about
    70% water saving over the irrigation period. The WB algorithm applied significantly
    greater amount of water than SOIL (p < 0.001) and SL + WB (p = 0.004; 273 mm).
    There was no significant difference between CWSI and SL + WB (p = 0.072). SOIL
    applied significantly less amount of water than the rest of the treatments, while
    there was no significant difference between NP and SL + WB (p = 0.1). Table 2.

    Watermark™ sensor readings showed no sign of water stress in the plots of SOIL
    and SL + WB as the soil water potential fluctuations were within the range of
    0 to −80 kPa (Fig. 6a). However, field inspections disclosed that the trees under
    the SL + WB algorithm may have been severely water-stressed as leaf drop and loss
    of turgidity, trees reduced overall growth, and abnormally small fruits in these
    plots were evident. Having under-irrigated the trees, SOIL and SL + WB exhibited
    an insufficient response to water stress. The under-irrigation of the plots under
    SOIL can be explained by the fact that the soil sensors monitored only a limited
    volume of the soil profile and might have not been at a location where the root
    system was active (Cohen et al., 2005). The Watermark™ sensors were not calibrated
    and single predefined wet and dry thresholds were applied to all of them. In addition,
    it was difficult to make a representative tension measurement due to the heterogeneity
    of soil water distribution under the drip irrigation system. Download : Download

    mean of three plots under the SL + WB (a), and SOIL (b) treatments. The dotted
    lines show the standard error of the mean. The dashed lines show the wet (Wet
    Thresh) and dry (Dry Thresh) thresholds. Using a feed-forward ET-based scheduling
    method in combination with a soil feedback (SL + WB) did not improve irrigation
    scheduling as signals to stop irrigation were perhaps issued too soon. The general
    algorithm of Casadesús et al. (2012) suggests that the use of the water balance
    model allows for a quick response to weather changes by predicting its effects,
    while at the same time the feedback mechanism can adapt the amount of water to
    the requirements of individual orchards by compensating for prediction errors.
    However, the accuracy of feedback is very important. Currently, available soil
    water content sensors including Watermark™ sensors cannot provide the required
    precision as achievable with the neutron probe. The soil water content of the
    plots under the CWSI and TTT treatments was measured weekly as for the NP plots.
    As depicted in Fig. 7a, mean soil water deficit (SWD) in the treatment plots of
    CWSI, TTT and NP in the top 0.6 m was within the well-watered range (<MAD of 50%).
    Mean SWD in the TTT plots was significantly lower than NP (p < 0.001) which was
    in agreement with applying slightly more irrigation water under TTT (not significant).
    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem for the trees under CWSI and TTT are depicted
    in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the trees under TTT maintained a relatively similar
    values of Ψstem to the trees under CWSI over the period. The measured values of
    Ψstem agreed well with non-stressed values reported for woody plants including
    apple trees (De Swaef et al., 2009, Naor and Cohen, 2003). As discussed in Osroosh
    et al. (2015b), the CWSI algorithm demonstrated a good response to the water status
    of the apple trees. The results here support the use of the TTT thermal-based
    approach to maintain well-watered apple trees under drip irrigation system in
    the semi-arid climate of central Washington. Download : Download high-res image

    Seasonal courses of midday ψstem in the CWSI and TTT treatments (b). The error
    bars show the standard error of the mean. The cumulative applied water for individual
    plots under TTT, WB and CWSI is illustrated in Fig. 8a and b for the growing period
    of 2013. Plots within the TTT and WB treatments had similar amounts of irrigation
    water delivered to them during the season, whereas the plots under CWSI showed
    some degree of variability. WB did not receive any feedback from the trees, thus
    microclimatic variability within the orchard was the only source of discrepancy
    among the plots and consequently the irrigation depths. The WB algorithm can lead
    to over- or under-irrigation if the estimates of crop water use are incorrect,
    the soil water content at the beginning of the season is unknown, or the application
    efficiency of irrigation system is lower than expected (Fereres et al., 2012).
    Apple trees have shown to close their stomata in response to a reduction in fruit
    loads (Palmer et al., 1997, Lakso, 2003, Girona et al., 2011). This reduction
    in evapotranspiration can challenge the WB approach as a lack of plant feedback
    may lead to significant errors in the estimations of water needs. The CWSI algorithm
    required meteorological data in addition to canopy temperature as input meaning
    it had to respond to atmospheric demand and signs of plant stress. This is while
    TTT only responded to increased canopy temperature which could be a result of
    increased air relative humidity not stomatal closure driven by water stress (Wanjura
    and Upchurch, 1997, Jones, 2004). This is reflected in TTT having a wetter soil
    profile as depicted in Fig. 7a. The CWSI algorithm, on the other hand, had a mechanism
    for withholding irrigation on humid days. It is known that CWSI values measured
    on cool and humid days are not reliable generating false stress signals and consequently
    resulting in over irrigation (Osroosh et al., 2015b). The CWSI algorithm interprets
    CWSI value in relation to the air relative humidity level and no irrigation decision
    is made on a humid day. Download : Download high-res image (274KB) Download :

    fruit yield Due to the fact that the trees were in an alternate bearing year,
    no quantitative information on the fruit yield was collected. However, our observations
    revealed that apple size in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments was noticeably smaller
    than CNTRL and never ripened (same number of fruits on trees). Larger shoot growth
    in the CNTRL treatment was observed compared with a much lower shoot and foliage
    growth in the SOIL and SL + WB treatments leading to shorter trees. The distance
    between rows in the CNTRL was covered with grass or algae and was always wet.
    This was not the case in other treatments. 3.3. Labor requirement and cost In
    the discussed control and monitoring system, the algorithms were executed using
    commercially available hardware and off-the shelf components. The major hardware
    cost included Campbell Scientific dataloggers and IRT sensors. We used an old
    model notebook as the central processing hardware which was worth roughly $100
    (U.S. dollars). The base cost of a sensing and actuating unit with the current
    hardware (datalogger, radio, battery, solar panel, actuator, 4 latching solenoids)
    is approximately $2500 in 2016. Considering the available commercial options,
    an IRT sensor adds an additional amount of $450–655 per measurement point. A soil/air
    temperature probe (without the shield) and a Watermark™ sensor can be purchased
    for $100 and $35–120, respectively. In the calculation of the cost, we replaced
    the CR10(X) with the CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and the RF401 with
    the RF401A (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) as they are no longer manufactured
    by the company. We obtained real-time meteorological data from a nearby weather
    station which was part of the WSU AgWeatherNet. The cost of such a station in
    case a farmer decides to invest in one is $9500 (sensors, hardware, installation,
    first year maintenance) (AgWeatherNet, 2013). Major costs for the control and
    monitoring system and alternative options for some components are summarized in
    Table 3 for comparison. A summary of the irrigation scheduling algorithms evaluated
    in the present study including the in-field sensor requirements, total upfront
    cost, advantages and shortcomings of the system are also summarized in Table 4.

    weather station is available. b This technique is manual in nature; however, we
    developed and implemented an automatic algorithm based on the original conventional
    irrigation practice. Although the GUI was designed to manage a specific orchard,
    it has the potential to be retrofitted to other irrigation systems or fields.
    Especially for research purposes, the laptop/PC and dataloggers can be replaced
    with Linux-based single-board computers such as the BeagleBone Black (BeagleBoard.org
    Foundation, Oakland Twp, MI), and the spread-spectrum radio with the XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, MN) to significantly reduce the cost. A network
    of inexpensive air temperature sensors can provide enough microclimatic data for
    estimation of ET. The WB algorithm requires only an air temperature sensor with
    no need for calibration which keeps the labor and capital investments very low.
    CWSI needs a network of infrared thermometers and meteorological sensors with
    no need for site-specific calibration. From both research and practice perspectives,
    the upfront cost and labor requirements of both CWSI and TTT are relatively low;
    however, regular maintenance (mainly cleaning) of IRTs is necessary to keep the
    network up and running. Despite the low sensor cost and ease of implementation,
    SOIL and SL + WB did not show to be reliable in terms of delivering enough water
    to stressed trees or detecting stress on-time. To achieve higher accuracies, using
    a larger number of Watermark™ sensors to account for sources of variability, site-specific
    calibration of individual sensors, or a combined use of soil water potential and
    soil water content sensors appears to be necessary. The maintenance was a major
    issue with the soil sensors wiring. There were several cases of wire damage accidents
    due to animal rodent activity in the field. Wireless IRTs (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2013) and less commonly wireless soil sensors are alternatives to wired sensors
    which will also lead to reduced installation and maintenance cost. These results
    support the suitability of simple irrigation scheduling techniques like WB for
    the automatic irrigation of apple orchard. Approaches like CWSI, TTT and WB are
    slightly more expensive, however they provide a higher degree of reliability compared
    to SOIL or SL + WB strategies. 4. Conclusions In this study, we developed and
    initially evaluated seven irrigation scheduling algorithms including two well-known
    plant/thermal-based strategies of the Time and Temperature Threshold (TTT) and
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). Irrigation water delivery was automatically scheduled
    to twenty-one management zones in an apple orchard using a wireless control and
    monitoring system. Precision irrigation algorithms were compared with the scientific-based
    method of irrigation scheduling using neutron probe and the conventional approach
    in the region in terms of ability to improve the current practice and simplicity
    of implementation from grower’s perspective. Our preliminary results supported
    the use of weather- and plant-based algorithms, decision support and monitoring
    software, and wireless sensor network for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated
    apple trees. The weather- and plant-based algorithms evaluated here were able
    to deliver enough irrigation water to the apple trees and avoid water stress.
    The soil-based approaches, on the other hand, failed to deliver enough water to
    the trees which resulted in severe water stress and impaired growth. The weather-
    and plant-based methods exhibited a promising performance at the level of the
    scientific irrigation scheduling method in terms of applying precise amount of
    water when needed and had the great advantage of being fully automatic. While
    the weather-based control algorithm showed a similar performance to the plant-based
    methods under the conditions of the experimental site, we believe a control algorithm
    with plant feedback is a superior choice when it comes to site- and crop-specific
    precision. However, the weather-based approach is a better choice when lower cost
    and complexity are more important to growers. This was an initial step towards
    implementing automatic irrigation on drip-irrigated apple trees. The presented
    irrigation scheduling approaches have the potential to improve water use efficiency,
    increased production, reduced production costs, reduced pumping energy requirements,
    and improved quality. Here, we mainly examined the various hardware and software
    aspects of a SCADA system and the suitability of the irrigation scheduling algorithms
    for maintaining well-watered trees. Future studies will reveal more on their benefits
    for decreasing losses of water and nutrients to deep percolation and their effect
    on yield and fruit quality. Acknowledgments This research was funded by the US

    control and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation
    exacerbate global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population
    growth and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source
    and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting
    of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid
    and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart Agriculture: Testbed General Architecture.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    rights and content Abstract With the development of sensing, wireless communication,
    and Internet technologies, we are now living in a world that is filled with various
    smart things – the Internet of Things (IOT). This paper introduces and prospects
    an emerging research area – the Embedded Intelligence (EI). This field aims at
    revealing the individual behaviours, spatial contexts, as well as social patterns
    and urban dynamics by mining the digital traces left by people while interacting
    with Internet of smart things (cameras, smart cars, smart cards, etc). In the
    agricultural sector we add mining of existing technology (books, articles, blue
    prints) to generate high depth ontologies or metadata and knowledge extraction
    from Big Data for reasoning and making pro-active decisions using open data information.
    We include intelligent data analysis to discover new knowledge from data records.
    The paper discusses the research history, characteristics, general architecture,
    major applications, and research issues of EI and exemplifies an application of
    the team in IOT smart irrigation. The purpose of presenting it as a Technology
    Roadmap (TRM) was to clarify the challenges and opportunities in the general area
    of “Intelligent Building Technologies” (IBT) and more specifically to smart greenhouses,
    smart irrigation, or smart crop management. The understanding of smart agriculture
    is important to be identified by the scientific community as a significant issue
    because it is needed for nations to develop and adopt these emerging technologies.
    Global interoperability is of key importance, and so it is a common understanding
    of values such as privacy and security, based on open, fair and transparent international
    standards. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords internet of

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\
    \ affordable digital data infrastructure;\ntechnology assist in smallholder data\
    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n3 of 31\nSection 3 discusses relevant approaches to data collection in\
    \ smallholder agriculture.\nWith these, we aim to layout a better insight of the\
    \ target population and bring about\nthe data gaps that needs to be ﬁlled. The\
    \ literature search methodology is explained in\nSection 4. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture,\nbased on reviewed literature\
    \ and a high-level system architecture are presented in Section 5.\nDiscussion\
    \ and possible opportunities and challenges are discussed in Sections 6 and 7,\n\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework as a standard [57]. The use of IoT and WSN\
    \ for\nagricultural applications was insigniﬁcant until around 2010 and has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsince then. Hence, we searched for publications in the years 2011–2021.\
    \ Research articles,\nsoftware and data publications, white papers and conference\
    \ proceedings were searched\nand acquired from three citation databases: ACM,\

    \ Next, results were ﬁltered using the exclusion criteria mentioned in Table 1.\
    \ A ﬁrst\nlevel discrimination was based on the paper’s type, followed by title\

    \ relevant to our study, of which about 50% were in con-\nference proceedings.\
    \ Further analysis was carried out on these papers to understand the\nhardware\
    \ and technical details. Sensors and nodes used in the work, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, power sources and energy harvesting schemes, micro-controllers and transceivers\n\
    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    \ connections with the Internet and the overall efﬁciency of the IoT applica-\n\
    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\
    investigation result of the work is to be communicated soon.\nFunding: This study\

    Abstract Globalization and free trade policies coupled with consumers’ demand
    for safe and high-quality foods have created pressure on various stakeholders
    (key players) attached within the agri-food supply chain. Influence, contributions,
    and socioeconomic and environmental factors are major players in achieving a successful
    flow of supply chain. Globally, various techniques and conceptual models have
    been proposed to render the agri-food supply chain effective and profitable. However,
    there are still several gaps and emerging challenges in the supply chain hindering
    fruitful, sustainable food production. In this chapter, an attempt has been made
    to identify and highlight the present world scenario and challenges encountered
    along the agri-food supply chain and its future prospects. References (0) Cited

    Precision agriculture is mainly used to make the farming as user-friendly to achieve
    the desired production of a crop. With the latest Geospatial technologies, the
    analysis related to any type of application using the Internet of Things (IoT)
    made each and everyone, to materialize the things whatever is imagined. The geographic
    information collected from various sources and with this, IoT establishes a communication
    to the entire world through an Internet. The information will be helpful in the
    maintenance of the farmland by applying the required amount of fertilizer at the
    right time in the right place. It is expected that in the future, this type of
    smart agriculture with the application of information and communication technologies
    including IoT will definitely bring a revolution in the global agricultural scenario
    to make it more resource-efficient and productive. The main goal in combining
    the Geospatial technology with IoT for precision is to monitor and predict the
    critical parameters such as water quality, soil condition, ambient temperature
    and moisture, irrigation, and fertilizer for improving the crop production. It
    can be expected that with the help of Geospatial and IoT in smart farming, the
    prediction of the amount of fertilizer, weeds, and irrigation will be accurate
    and it helps the farmers in making decisions related to all the requirements in
    terms of control and supply. Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
    Download chapter PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture sector plays a premeditated role
    in building a backbone of economic development in India. Due to the rapid growth
    of the population, the demand for the food also raises. The rapid development
    in the space-research technology and satellite communication also will help to
    provide regular updates and inputs about the weather forecasting, crop production
    statistics to the farmers for attaining the sustainable agriculture. And also
    it reduces the risk in the agriculture, increases the crop productivity and economic
    level of the farmers and fulfills the demands of the foods. Precision agriculture
    is defined as the technology-based crop system, designed for long-term, site-specific
    applications, and aimed to increase the quality and profitability of crop production
    and farmer’s economic growth by adjusting the agriculture inputs based on the
    local requirements of the croplands and also reduces the environmental impacts
    and risks. The crop diseases and the reduction in crop yield invariably depend
    on many factors such as bacteria, virus, fungus, rats, and also environmental
    factors like wind speed, direction, radiation, humidity, temperature, soil and
    water acidity. The precision farming plays a vital role in the reduction of negative
    impacts on the crop productivity by analyzing and monitoring spatial variability
    on the water, soil, and environmental conditions. In precision agriculture, the
    detailed information about the spatial variability of cropland is required to
    find the current status of the crop field and take the suitable decision on crop
    field management. The Geospatial technologies such as remote sensing, Global Positioning
    System (GPS), satellite imagery, and Geo-fencing, etc., are used to obtain valuable
    geographic information from various sources and with this, IoT establishes a communication
    to the entire world through the Internet. Thus, the users can extract the valuable
    information from anywhere and anytime. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of
    the key components that integrates hardware, computing devices, physical objects,
    software in order to establish the communication, collect and exchange data among
    each other [1]. A general schematic of IoT is shown in Fig. 1. These technologies
    can be suitable for almost all the applications for analyzing the issues and meeting
    out the challenges. This chapter mainly focuses on the technologies in precision
    agriculture. WSNs are one of the simplest technologies to collect and monitor
    the actual spatial variability of the crop field and these have the advantages
    such as cost-effective, real-time suitability, and ease of deployment. The decision-support
    system in a farmhouse or mainframe computer integrate the prior knowledge and
    on-field sensed data with GIS to make optimized control decisions in water irrigation,
    pesticides, and the duration of fertilization [2]. This leads to many open challenging
    unexplored research areas in precision agriculture and act as a guiding tool for
    the farmers in diagnosing the crop or plant diseases accurately in a timely manner
    in order to protect and enhance the yield and in estimating and utilizing the
    available resources for e.g., water and manure at the right time and in the right
    quantity. Fig. 1 Concept of IoT Full size image 1.1 Applications of IoT in Precision
    Agriculture The smart agriculture paradigm evolved to formulate the utilization
    of new technologies in precision farming. In smart agriculture scenario, numerous
    services are developed to enhance the standard of the farmer’s lives, and economics
    by implementing the farming applications [3]. 1.1.1 Irrigation Monitoring System
    Recent advancements in the agriculture systems need an effective irrigation management
    to optimize the usage of the water in farming. To utilize the available water
    resources, a cost-effective micro irrigation system is implemented [4]. By using
    the satellite imagery and remote sensing, the efficiency of the micro irrigation
    farming can be further extended. 1.1.2 Pest and Disease Control Nowadays, the
    WSNs and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV technologies are used to monitor the crop
    leaves quality and to predict the occurrence and possibilities of the pest in
    crops [5]. It can be predicted by using environmental conditions such as temperature,
    wind speed, and humidity, etc., thereby increasing the crop quality and minimizes
    the expenditure of the farming cost. 1.1.3 Controlled Usage of Fertilizer The
    yield and quality of the crop productivity are directly related to the use of
    fertilizer at the right time and right quantity. The prediction of the optimal
    amount of fertilizer is an important task in smart agriculture [6]. The estimation
    on the amount of fertilizer can be found by using the soil nutrients sensors which
    can monitor the variation in soil nutrition such as pH, Nitrogen (N), Potassium
    (K), Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and Phosphorous (P), etc. 1.1.4 Water Quality
    Monitoring The sensors can be used to measure the water temperature, pH, electrical
    conductivity, turbidity, nitrates and dissolved oxygen. 1.1.5 Green House Gas
    Monitoring The changes in the \(\text {CO}_2\) and \(\text {CH}_4\) are directly
    affecting the global temperature and have a straight impact on the agriculture.
    The emission of \(\text {CO}_2\) and \(\text {CH}_4\) from the various farming
    lands are monitored by using the WSNs and satellite imagery [7]. 1.1.6 Surveillance
    of Cattle Movement The latest technologies such as the camera based WSNs, UAV,
    and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), etc., are employed to monitor whether
    any animals are moving or grazing near the croplands or not [8,9,10]. 1.1.7 Assert
    Tracking and Farming System Monitoring Presently, various advanced devices along
    with IoTs are deployed to fetch the information about the crops. These are shared
    with the cloud, which can ease to control remotely and triggers the automation
    in agriculture and also makes it easy in smart agriculture with remote tracking
    and monitoring [11]. To summarize the remainder of the chapters, Sect. 2 gives
    the details of Information and Communication Technology in Agriculture. Section
    3 presents Research challenges and issues in IoT. A framework of Geospatial data
    with IoT for Precision agriculture is detailed in Sect. 4 and the conclusion is
    presented in Sect. 5. 2 Information and Communication Technology in Agriculture
    The IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring is employed to allow the professional
    and farmers for monitoring the condition of the environment, farmland, soil, and
    crop growth. The entire smart agriculture system consists of the various types
    of sensor, UAV, satellite, GPS, actuators, gateway, cloud server, Internet, and
    Android mobile phone. The actuator has a provision for driving systems in the
    smart agriculture which respond to the given command by the central co-coordinator.
    For example, the central coordinator estimates the soil moisture and schedules
    the irrigation (turn-on and turn-off) of the actuators based on the readings from
    the farm field sensors. Each sensor node sends the sensed data to the cloud server
    through the gateway and Internet. Particularly, the gateway is used to collect
    the data from the sensor nodes and also to distribute the control message to the
    sensors, mobile phone, and actuators. Figure 2 shows an example of Information
    and Communication Technology in Agriculture. The software and the hardware presented
    in it aids in giving a success in the crop production with the help of these technologies.
    Fig. 2 Example showing information and communication technology in agriculture
    Full size image 2.1 Role of IoT The Internet of Things is the most promising technologies
    in precision for providing numerous real-time solutions towards the modernization.
    It is a network of numerous things connected with various embedded electronics,
    service provider, automated machinery, persons, software, and hardware through
    Internet enabling these to gather and share the information for taking suitable
    solution in the crisis situation or long-term monitoring at anywhere and anytime,
    resulting in better economic gain, and quality of life [12]. Example of IoT hardware
    platforms is depicted in Table 1. Table 1 Comparison of various IoT hardware platforms
    available in the markets Full size table Some of the benefits of the IoT in smart
    agriculture are as follows: 1. Increases the profitability of agriculture. 2.
    Improves the quality of crop yields. 3. Minimizes the negative ecological effect.
    4. Prevents the occurrence of plant diseases and pests. 5. Alerts the farmers
    during natural calamities, hazards, storm, etc., at the right time. 6. Allows
    remote monitoring, access, and control. 2.1.1 Role of Big Data in IoT The evolution
    of the big data and Internet of Things (IoT) becomes an ever-growing technology
    in smart agriculture development which provides the enhancement of socio-economics,
    logistics, and living standards. The IoT continues to integrate the huge amount
    of data collected from various sources (data on social media and commercial networking,
    banking transactions, government sector and industrial records, forecasting of
    the weather, sensor networks, satellites, study materials, GPS, and space other
    research data) throughout the world [13]. For different kinds of smart applications
    and services, the big data has undergone the different level of analysis to produce
    the needed semantic information. But the big data results in the following practical
    challenges [14]. Data representation: The big data have uniqueness in the dataset
    including type, pattern, syntax, semantics, size, and accessibility. For computer
    interpretation and analysis, an improper representation of data will give unreliability
    in the original data and may also affect the efficient interpretation of various
    dataset. Thus, proficient data representation is needed to manage the heterogeneous
    dataset at various levels and also enables the different field to access the data
    [13]. Storage of big data: Today, various kinds of data are increasing at an exponential
    rate. In 2020, the amount of data generated and replicated from 4.4 to 44 ZB,
    said according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). Thus, an intelligent
    data redundancy reduction and compression techniques are needed to reduce the
    storage cost-effectively [14]. Responsiveness: Traditional data analysis systems
    lack maintaining the heterogeneous dataset structure which causes data incompatible
    issues in various engineering and research application. And also it fails to find
    structures and relationships within big data in a timely manner, thereby causing
    latency in data retrieval and processing. Hence, an effective data mining and
    analytical algorithms are highly concentrated, so as to overcome the issue of
    scalability and manageability in analyzing the huge volume of data [14]. Energy
    and heat dissipation management: The transmission, storage, and processing of
    big data by the server will consume more electric power. And also, it dissipates
    huge volume of heat which reduces the performance and lifespan of the server.
    Thus, effective energy consumption and heat control and management mechanisms
    have great attention in preserving the economy and environment [14]. 2.1.2 Role
    of Cloud and Fog Computing in IoT The cloud based service refers to a variety
    of resources related to the applications provide to the users on-demand over the
    Internet. The cloud computing is an effective computation paradigm for analyzing
    and managing the big data in IoT. The big data related processes such as data
    acquisitions, processing, filtering, and transmission are rationalized for providing
    identical information related to the needs of the user through IoT. Cloud computing
    offers adequate resources and solutions to maintain, store, diagnostic, and analyze
    to provide a solution for the large amount of data produced by the IoT [15]. These
    resources are remotely located and managed by the service provider and are used
    for the integration of host data, diagnostic, visualization, and development of
    the smart application. The remote user can easily access the cloud platform with
    their services and resources by using a mobile phone. Numerous sensor nodes are
    deployed in the targeted area to sense the interest in croplands and environments.
    These field sensors sense the event, pre-process, and transmit the collected data
    to the cloud-server directly or through gateway nodes [16]. The performance of
    the cloud computing is limited due to scalability, congestion and latency [17].
    This is because of a huge volume of the gathered data transfer to the cloud and
    then sent back to the application devices which have a serious impact on the performance.
    To overcome these drawbacks, IoT architectures are developed with distributed
    computing model based on the fog paradigms, in which the fog computing node is
    deployed at the edge of the network to perform the automated decision and learning
    process, storage, and interface with cloud services [1, 15]. This fog computing
    paradigm allows the farmers to easily analyze the changes and make the decision
    in a short period. 2.2 Role of Sensors The advancement in the MEMS and other communication
    technologies are used to invent a compact and low-cost sensor node which is utilized
    in a variety of real-time application for collecting the information about the
    environmental and physical parameters associated to the crops [10, 18]. It can
    support the agriculture professional to make wise decisions and will be informed
    to the farmers for further action. Advantages of WSNs in smart agriculture are
    as follows: 1. Ease of node deployment. 2. Low establishment cost. 3. Long-term
    croplands monitoring. 4. Real-time support and intervention. 5. Increased crop
    productivity. Various sensor nodes that are suitable for agriculture are categorized
    into the plant-related sensor, soil and water-related sensor and environment-related
    sensor and are discussed below. 2.2.1 Soil and Water Related Sensors Table 2 depicts
    that the various types of the sensor are currently utilized for measuring the
    soil and water related parameters such as moisture, water flow, temperature, nutrients,
    water content, water level, and conductivity. Table 2 Comparison of various soil
    related sensors available in the markets Full size table 2.2.2 Environment Related
    Sensors The environment-related information is an essential part of the precision
    agriculture. The potential uses of these sensor nodes include monitoring the greenhouse
    gases, pollution, ambient temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure,
    solar radiation, and lightning. The environment-related sensors are mentioned
    in Table 3. Table 3 Comparison of various environmental sensors available in the
    markets Full size table 2.2.3 Plant Related sensors These types of sensor are
    attached to the plants for monitoring the leaf wetness, temperature, conductivity,
    ice formation, water level, plant stem-cell growth, and yield quality. Table 4
    shows the various types of sensors with plant related measurement parameters.
    Table 4 Comparison of various plant related sensors available in the markets Full
    size table 2.3 Role of Remote Sensing Remote sensing is described as a process
    to gather information through non-physical contact measurements of radiation reflected
    or emitted from the particular material [19]. The remote sensing is mainly depending
    on the reflectance or emission property of the object. The signal emission or
    reflectance of the object is based on the chemical and physical characteristics
    of the particular material, and their geographic environment such as temperature,
    leaf wetness, and chlorophylls, etc. The chemical compounds of the crop, called
    chlorophylls emit the radiation which is inversely related to the absorption of
    the electromagnetic radiation. The measurement of the radiated signal is performed
    through the different levels of spectral bands including Green, Blue, Red, Near
    Infra-Red (NIR), and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR). In agriculture, the Green, Red,
    and Infra-Red are widely used to obtain the vegetation indices. The common method
    for measuring the vegetation index is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI). These indices are used to analyze specific characteristics such as crop
    biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI), crop count, water content, plant stress, humidity.
    In agriculture, the variation in chlorophyll concentration is highly sensitive
    to the variation of green and red wavelength (i.e., the absorption and reflection
    measurement of electromagnetic radiation through the green and red wavelengths
    are inversely varied with respect to the concentration of chlorophylls) [19].
    For example, highly concentrated chlorophyll plants attract more radiation in
    red and blue wavelength and less reflection in infrared or green wavelength. On
    the contrary, less chlorophyll reflects with the high red wavelength. Thus, investigating
    the visible to the infrared spectral band can give necessary information about
    the plant’s cellular arrangement for measuring the plant stress, and productivity.
    The analysis of the red edge spectral region provides a better responsiveness
    under stress induced by chlorophylls content changes and also accurately estimates
    the LAI than the green and red spectral range. The remote sensing can be performed
    by satellite-based platform (satellite, UAV, etc.) and ground-based platform (tractor,
    hand-held sensors, etc.). Table 5 Comparison of satellites used in the precision
    agriculture (https://directory.eoportal.org/) Full size table Multispectral Scanner
    System sensors, LiDAR [20], RaDAR, thermal and infrared cameras are frequently
    used in the satellite and UAV [8], so as to estimate the spatial factors of agriculture
    objects such as biomass, N stress, yield mapping, pest and disease detection which
    is based on the observation of the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation from
    the soil and crop organic contents. The recent improvement in real-time satellite
    imagery (e.g., Eo-1 Hyperion, Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI)) is high
    spatial and spectral resolution that could be provided the better classification
    and decision making in precision agriculture [19]. Examples of satellites that
    are used in the Precision agriculture are given in Table 5. Ground-based remote
    sensing otherwise called as proximal remote sensing, in which the sensor nodes
    are mounted on to the sprayer, tractor, etc., had important capabilities for determining
    spatial patterns of soil organic matter, calcium, phosphorous, potassium, carbon,
    soil temperature, moisture, salinity, soil pH, N stress, water stress, and crop
    yield. These types of sensing provide a real-time agricultural application specific
    management such as fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation. The ground-based remote
    sensing is more accurate as compared to the sky-based platform since it is less
    affected by the cloud cover. Asher et al. [21] discussed a ground-based remote
    sensing, in which linear move irrigation system designed with six IR sensors and
    moving weather station was used to find the canopy temperatures and dry area of
    the cropland. This sensed data enabled the grower to open the irrigation control
    valve. Applications of the remote sensing in agriculture are listed as follows:
    (i) cropping system analysis, (ii) agriculture drought assessment and monitoring,
    (iii) soil mapping and monitoring, (iv) water resources monitoring, (v) crop area
    estimation and monitoring, (vi) incidence forecasting, (vii) diseases and pests
    detection. The limitations of the remote sensing in the agriculture are as follows:
    1. Simultaneous sensing of the reflectance radiation from the crop by the sensor
    causes the confusion in spectral band. 2. The scaling issues due to the inappropriateness
    between the actual considered and remote sensing data and also it provide the
    inadequate information for evaluating the historical data. 3. Low accuracy in
    reflectance measurement of the soil and water due to the organic matter, surface
    roughness, and moisture, thus characterizing the soil and water properties are
    very complex. 4. Hard to classify the crop species. 5. The usage of the passive
    sensor in the remote sensing is severely affected by the weather condition. 2.4
    Role of GPS The GPS and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) give a Geospatial
    position on the earth surface or it provides the position of the UAV on the sky
    with respect to the earth surface [22]. The crop field monitoring connected with
    GPS provides the necessary data to map the agriculture applications and a site-specific
    cropland management. The tangible benefits of using GNSS and GPS in agriculture
    are: (i) providing guidance for auto steering the tractors, sprayers, and spreaders
    on the cropland, (ii) allowing the worker to perform the agriculture activity
    in low visibility condition. 2.5 Role of GIS The geographic information system
    provides a computer-based framework for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing,
    mapping, and visualization of Geospatial data. With this geographic science with
    tools, GIS depicts closer discernment into data for understanding the pattern,
    collaboration, and circumstances which help the people to make smarter decision
    attaining their goal in real time practices [23]. The GIS technology is mainly
    used to store the layers of information and integrate the agriculture field with
    remotely sensed data and produces the number of possibilities in analyzing the
    geographical data. Numerous modern GIS software packages such as GRASS GIS, ArcGIS,
    QGIS, OpenStreetMap, and GeoMedia, etc., are easily shared their resources (imagery,
    features, base-maps, spreadsheets, and tables) and embedded with apps for solving
    a complex problem and it is freely accessible by the public user [24]. The GPS
    provides the position of the user or receiver through showing the longitude, latitude,
    and altitude which is not useful in finding the location. But GIS provides the
    information about where you are on the map by using computerized mapping system
    (contains all geographic Information and maps) which also displays or visualizes
    the ground terrain surface in 2D or 3D scenes. For example, GIS model is incorporated
    into GPS providing necessary information on the identification of sensor node
    placement with the earth and the mapping of satellite image to the corresponding
    farmer’s registered cropland. 2.6 Role of Wireless Communication Technology As
    depicted in Table 6, the Bluetooth 802.15.1 offers low powered and high speed
    over short-range wireless communication which connects mobile phones and portable
    devices and it can connect the devices up to 10 m within its range. Zigbee 802.15.4
    is low cost and low powered communication technology which is specially designed
    for controlling and monitoring of sensor network application and can provide coverage
    up to 100 m with the transfer rate is up to 250 Kbps. The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi)
    standards 802.11a and 802.11b are introduced in 1999 and provide data transfer
    rate up to 11 Mbps, followed by 802.11g is speed up to 54 Mbps. It is commonly
    used in the educational institution, company and business premises, and railway
    station which allow every individual to access the internet through WiFi. Worldwide
    Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) 802.16 is a new wireless technology
    in broadband network access. It can provide the services up to 50 Km with data
    transfer rate up to 70 Mbps. However, WiMAX requires the license for using the
    spectral bandwidth. The 2G evolved in the 90s comprises the IS-95 and GSM digital
    voice standards. The added feature of GSM is that it can support circuit switched
    data (wired communication) at speed up to 14.4 Kbps. The advent of 3G becomes
    a new era in cellular mobile communication development in the view of high-speed
    data communication, security, bandwidth, and support various multimedia applications,
    etc. it can support the data rate up to 2 Mbps and 384 Kbps for indoor and outdoor
    application respectively. The 3G licensed network services are operated and owned
    by the service providers and these services sell to the end users based on the
    usage of the data or use the network resources per seconds. The 4G is Internet
    Protocol (IP) based integrated system which provides the data rate between 100
    Mbps and 1 Gbps in both indoor and outdoor application. The salient features of
    4G are high quality, speed, security, and bandwidth, and also allow the mobile
    users to access the Internet at anywhere and anytime. Table 6 Comparison of various
    wireless communication technologies [17] Full size table 3 Research Challenges
    and Issues in IoT 3.1 Security Related Issues The productivity of the agriculture
    is directly related to the environmental parameters such as humidity, wind speed,
    temperature, acidity, \(\text {CO}_2\), and soil moisture, etc. if any modification,
    insertion, and deletion of these parameters have a negative outcome on the crop
    growth and productivity. Hence, the security and privacy are crucial issues in
    cropland. For example, any modification on the fertilizer quantity leads to reduce
    the productivity of the crop or the excessive use of fertilizer causing environmental
    pollution and reduce the groundwater quality. Therefore, great effort is needed
    to protect the environmental data from the network hackers or eavesdroppers [3,
    25,26,27]. 3.2 Data Management In smart agriculture, various kinds of data are
    collected from the several sources such as sensors in the cropland, satellite
    images, GPS, meteorological, etc., which are intended to be connected to the cloud.
    The management of these big data is a challenging task to the designer in agriculture
    because the determination of the data collection, diagnosis, analysis, decision
    making, and evaluation are the complex process in the cloud [28]. Thus, the integration
    of IoT and SDN require a new methodology in deployment, hardware and software
    services, communication, and resources [29]. 3.3 Fault Tolerance It is an important
    attribute of the WSNs for achieving an efficient smart agriculture. There are
    different kinds of faults occurred in WSNs due to (i) uncorrected values showed
    in the sensor’s measurement, (ii) deployment of the faulty sensor, (iii) poor
    network design, (iv) failure in the communication link, (v) exhausting of the
    battery energy very quickly [30]. 3.4 Memory The large size of memory is required
    for storing the big data which are collected from the various deployed sensor
    nodes and other resources. These collected data are used to analyze and derive
    the conclusion about the current status of the cropland, crop growth, fertilizer
    and pest level, and also send the valid command to the farmers through SMS or
    mobile agriculture app. [17]. 4 Framework of Geospatial Data with IoT for Precision
    Agriculture 4.1 Existing Infrastructures Akkas et al. [31] developed an IoT based
    greenhouse monitoring in which the Micaz motes were utilized to collect the environmental
    parameters such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure. The collected information
    transmitted through 802.15.4 to the MIB 250 base station, so as to perform the
    analysis of the collected data and make the inference and operation management.
    The end user can communicate with BS by using the mobile phone or the internet
    to get the management information about the green-house. Nagarajan et al. [32]
    demonstrated a sprinkler irrigation automated system with the help of the pH,
    temperature, and soil moisture sensor. These sensors were used to gather the field
    information and forwarded to the BS through Zigbee protocol. The decision support
    system in the BS made the inference about the cycle of irrigation and sends the
    command to the irrigation actuator through the PIC microcontroller. Martinez et
    al. [33] discussed a measurement of greenhouse climatic parameters such as humidity,
    air-speed, ultraviolet radiation, and globe and air temperature and transmitted
    to the remote operator through 802.15.4. Foughali et al. [34] developed a blight
    forecast model based on the weather condition and field sensor (Waspmote 868 SMA
    4.5 DBI). The sensed information was transmitted to the IoT cloud platform (Ubidots)
    through the gateway by using 802.15.4. The ubidots were analyzed and monitored
    for the incoming sensed and offered the notification service to the farmer’s mobile
    phone. 4.2 Case Studies Some real-time of agriculture related application by using
    IOT are discussed in below and summarized in Table 7. These applications related
    documents are gathered from www.campbellsci.com. 4.2.1 Pest Control and Evapotranspiration
    System Radu Carcoana, North Dakota State University described the weather monitoring
    and pesticide application, in which various kinds of sensors (wind speed and direction,
    temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and water
    level) are deployed in the region of North Dakota, USA in order to collect the
    field information and enhance the crop productivity and quality. These recorded
    sensor data are accessed through the phone which can be used as input of an automated
    decision system to monitor the specific crop diseases and plant-growth. This will
    help the formers to take a decision about when and how much uses pesticide and
    irrigate. 4.2.2 Flood and Irrigation Monitoring Rajat Saha, MBK Engineers Narendra
    S. Raghuwanshi, Indian Institute of Technology Shrinivasa K. Upadhyaya, UC Davis
    Wesley W. Wallender, UC Davis David C. Slaughter, UC Davis tested the irrigation
    control in the area of 720 ft long and 50 ft wide in University of California
    Davis campus which comprises of field sensor and communication system for monitoring
    the flood irrigation water at the lower end of the cropland. The sensor data are
    recorded in the micro-logger CR3000, which in turn transmits the collected data
    to the irrigator through the cellular modem (RAVEN110). 4.2.3 \(CO_2\) Monitoring
    Agricultural Research Service (ARS) demonstrated the \(\text {CO}_2\) flux cycle
    measurement in central and western US by monitoring the exchange of carbon dioxide
    between the rangeland and atmosphere. 4.2.4 Water-Resource Management and Weather
    Monitoring South Jersey Resource Conservation and Development Council, Inc., Campbell
    Scientific, Inc., developed a Resource Information Serving Everyone (RISE) network
    which aimed for watershed protection and management. In this, the water quality
    and weather station were established in the New Jersey by deploying various communication
    system, environment and the soil related sensor for collecting the valuable field
    data. These collected data are retrieved from the water quality and weather station
    through the telephone modem, thus, the user can build up own irrigation management
    system for their particular cropland. 4.2.5 Korea: Flux Monitoring over a Rice
    Paddy Campbell Scientific and Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Yonsei University,
    Seoul, Korea, jointly calculated the greenhouse gas fluxes such as methane, carbon
    dioxide, and water vapor over paddy by using a \(\text {CH}_4\)/\(\text {CO}_2\)/\(\text
    {H}_2\text {O}\) vapor profile system and eddy-covariance system. 4.2.6 ISS System
    for Studying Plants in Space, Feeding Space Travelers The Utah State University,
    Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) developed a plant growing chamber in space with
    the help of Campbell Scientific, and International Space Station (ISS). The data
    logger is used to monitor the temperature and water content, and also control
    the plant growing environment. This project is used for the micro-gravity food
    production, as well as it can also be used to perform the research in improving
    the space traveler life quality. Table 7 Summary of the case studies related to
    the precision agriculture (www.campbellsci.com) Full size table 4.2.7 Costa Rica:
    Banana Production Campbell Scientific and Costa Rica for the National Banana Corporation
    (CORBANA) established the network by using agro-meteorological stations. This
    network performs the data transmission between the filed sensor and the end users,
    mail services, Internet, VoIP at the end office through a Mikrotic Wi-Fi. Thus,
    CORBANA specialist can perform the relevant precautionary measures about the irrigation,
    fertilization, controlled usage of pesticides, diseases, banana production based
    on the collected field parameters (wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, soil
    moisture, relative humidity, temperature, leaf wetness, and solar radiation).
    4.2.8 Colombia: Fighting Fungus on Roses The Agro-Industrial Research Center at
    Jorge Tadeo Lozano University studied the various environmental conditions which
    encourage the growth of fungus on the rose. In order to avoid the downy mildew
    on roses, the leaf wetness sensor (Decagon LWS) and Apogee SI-111 Infrared Radiometers
    were deployed in the farming land. These sensors were connected to data-loggers
    (CR1000) through AM16/32 multiplexers. These sensor nodes were used to monitor
    the environmental changes and made a better condition for preventing the fungus
    growth accordingly, resulted in the avoidance of the use of pesticides and environmental
    pollution. 4.3 Proposed Framework Precision Agriculture is defined as a method
    of farm management that retrieves the existing real-time data, process and analyzes
    it and provides a solution to the farmers in the decision-making process to decrease
    inputs and increase crop production. The technological developments embarked on
    a way to use these in all fields of applications. The agriculture industry and
    automation suppliers are trying to explore and utilize the opportunities for improving
    their production, profitability, and farming practices with the help of IoT and
    digital solutions. The proposed architecture for the integration of Geospatial
    data with IoT to realize precision agriculture is shown in detail in Fig. 3. Fig.
    3 Concept of IoT Full size image It is observed from the figure, those sensors
    in the farm and farm equipment provide real-time data availability and alarms
    through the Internet for further process. The collected real-time data are analyzed
    using Big Data analytics and stored in the cloud server for making decisions.
    The decisions are taken after collecting the Geospatial data. In sensor-based
    precision agriculture system, data from the sensors are generally shared among
    the stakeholders either through a local server or the cloud. This information
    exchange purely depends on the reliability of the communication network and the
    Internet. Then, the processed data can be retrieved via smart phones and user-friendly
    apps that are available to represent it in a simple and clear format. It is found
    from the literature, the Geospatial information has an impact over the crop yield,
    irrigation and amount of fertilizers etc. Hence for taking a corrective and preventive
    action, IoT based smart farming is felt to be streamlined. It definitely helps
    in the prediction of the available and required water resources, fertilizers,
    and control of weeds. In recent years, Precision agriculture gained popularity
    among farmers across the globe because of the technological developments. Farmers
    are in need of these for realizing the optimum production with the available resources.
    Due to the global warming and sudden fluctuations in the climatic conditions and
    weather patterns, no one can expect an efficient production in agriculture without
    the help of these smart farming. 5 Conclusion IoT is a vital technology in precision
    agriculture for increasing the crop productivity, monitoring the environmental
    factor, measuring the quality of water and soil. The IoT technology allows the
    farmers to monitor the crop remotely and make any decision related to the agriculture
    tasks like water irrigation, greenhouse maintenance, and pest monitoring, etc.,
    at any time and anywhere through the Internet. In this chapter, the components
    and technologies involved in the IoT and their strengths, challenges, and issues
    all are elaborated. The need for the Geospatial data with IoT is discussed. This
    chapter reveals key strategies to handle the environmental crises such as flood,
    drought, cyclone, pollution, global warming, and blights, etc. and provides the
    awareness about the utilization of various technologies which are involved in
    the precision agriculture. The outcome of the proposal is to develop awareness
    about the precision farming and available control software application toolkits
    in the market and to make use of it. With this, the farmers can easily access
    the zone management office, update the crop details automatically and to retrieve
    the awareness and control information such as soil irrigation, soil nutrition,
    crop diseases etc. The proposed framework if it is developed as a model and implemented
    in real time, definitely it will bring a revolution in the agricultural sector.

    \ to improve agricultural practices by facilitating decision-making based on\n\
    gathered environmental data (i.e., weather forecasting, crop monitoring, and soil\

    \ the collection of environmental data in the presence of\nconnectivity disruptions,\
    \ their gathering, and their exploitation by end-users or by systems that\nmust\
    \ perform actions according to the values of those collected data. In this paper,\
    \ we present a\nmiddleware platform for the Internet of Things that implements\

    1. Introduction\nWith the recent progress achieved in the automation of farm machinery\
    \ and in the monitoring\nof the physical environment, agriculture moves towards\
    \ more environmentally-friendly, smart and\nprecise agriculture, addressing challenges\
    \ ranging from manpower shortage, adaptation to climate\nchanges, optimization\
    \ of environment resource usage, reduction of the usage of chemical crop\nprotection\
    \ products, etc. The Internet of Things (IoT)—which aims at connecting to the\
    \ Internet\nphysical objects that can sense, communicate, compute and sometimes\
    \ actuate—can indubitably\ncontribute to the development of the smart agriculture\
    \ and farming. A few research works have\nrecently experimented with the usage\
    \ of IoT platforms in the agriculture and farming context [1–3].\nThese experiments\
    \ have highlighted several issues that must be addressed to efﬁciently and\nautomatically\
    \ collect data in such challenging contexts, especially regarding the network\
    \ connectivity,\nthe network architecture and the interoperability between physical\
    \ objects. Applications and services\ndedicated to smart agriculture and farming\
    \ can tolerate, in some cases, delays and disruptions in data\nexchanges. Indeed,\
    \ some physical objects do not need to be connected to the Internet permanently,\n\
    because they measure environmental properties that do not evolve quickly (e.g.,\
    \ soil moisture and\nplant growth), and because they are in sleep mode most of\
    \ the time for energy saving purposes.\nAn alternative or a complement to long\
    \ range, low power and low rate wireless standards such as\nLoRa/LoRaWAN and SigFox,\
    \ could be to interconnect such devices to gateways opportunistically\nusing data\
    \ mules and short radio range wireless interfaces such as IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE\
    \ 802.11—that\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33; doi:10.3390/ﬁ11020033\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet\n\
    Future Internet 2019, 11, 33\n2 of 19\nallow transfering, thanks to a higher throughput,\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of data in a short time\nfrom sensors (e.g., camera) or\
    \ to agribots (ﬁeld maps, tasks to achieve, etc.). Such an alternative,\nwhich\
    \ relies on opportunistic communication and computing techniques, is known as\
    \ the opportunistic\nsensing paradigm [4].\nBesides these problems, the lack of\
    \ semantic description and logical representation of physical\nobjects does not\
    \ allow easily consolidating collected data with data from external Web services\n\
    (e.g., weather forecast and plant growth models), to assemble objects to build\
    \ sophisticated systems,\nand to create high level services and applications that\
    \ should help farmers to take decisions, or even to\nperform tasks automatically.\
    \ The Web of Things (WoT) [5] is an attractive solution to address these\nissues.\
    \ Indeed, the WoT extends the IoT, and aims at doing for physical objects what\
    \ the Web did\nfor information resources, namely an identiﬁcation of resources\
    \ using Uniform Resource Identiﬁers\n(URIs), a semantic description of resources,\
    \ an access of resources through standard protocols, and the\ninclusion in resources\
    \ of links to other resources to enable a scalable discovery of highly distributed\n\
    resources. Following the trend of Web 2.0 participatory services, in particular\
    \ Web Mashups, it thus is\npossible to create applications mixing physical devices\
    \ with virtual services on the Web—this type of\napplications is often referred\
    \ to as physical Mashup [6,7].\nIn this paper, we present a WoT oriented platform\
    \ called ASAWoO (https://asawoo.gitlab.\nio/ [8]), that implements opportunistic\
    \ and disruption-tolerant networking and computing techniques.\nThis platform\
    \ makes it possible to deﬁne and instantiate logical extensions, called Avatars,\
    \ of physical\nobjects. Physical objects can be conﬁgured and controlled through\
    \ their avatar. Avatars provide a\nsemantic description of physical objects and\
    \ of their functionalities. Functionalities are implemented as\nREST services,\
    \ and can be deployed dynamically by the Avatars themselves according to the description\n\
    of the physical objects and of the execution context of these ones. Similar to\
    \ the functionalities,\nexecution contexts are described semantically, thus allowing\
    \ Avatars to reason on these descriptions\nand to perform adaptations dynamically.\
    \ REST services can be invoked using standard protocols\nsuch as HTTP or CoAP,\
    \ either using Internet-legacy transport protocols or disruption-tolerant and\n\
    opportunistic protocols. This platform can be deployed on physical objects themselves\
    \ provided\nthat they have enough processing and memory capacities, on gateways\
    \ to which physical objects are\nconnected or on cloud infrastructure. Objects\
    \ can be ﬁxed or mobile. For instance, data generated\nby the ﬁxed sensors can\
    \ be collected by data mules (e.g., tractors) and transmitted to their logical\n\
    representations deployed in a cloud infrastructure. These features make this platform\
    \ a relevant\nsupport for the development and the deployment of cyber-physical\
    \ systems and applications dedicated\nto the environmental sensing and to the\
    \ smart agriculture. In this paper, we also report experiments\nwe achieved with\
    \ this platform in an experimental agricultural farm.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows. Section 2 presents research works dealing\nwith opportunistic\
    \ environmental sensing, and details their limitations. Section 3 presents the\
    \ ASAWoO\nmiddleware platform and the concept of Avatars, and discusses the advantages\
    \ such a platform could\nbring in an opportunistic sensing and actuating context\
    \ such as smart agriculture and farming. Section 4\ndescribes the experiments\
    \ we performed with the ASAWoO platform, and presents some results we\nobtained.\
    \ Section 5 concludes this paper by summarizing our contribution.\n2. Related\
    \ Work\nOver the last years, a large majority of the research dealing with agricultural\
    \ crop monitoring\nhas focused on the development of small-scale testbeds and\
    \ specialized applications built on wireless\nnetworks formed by ﬁxed sensors\
    \ (WSN) [3,9,10]. Kim et al. [11] presented an example of such works\nthat rely\
    \ on infrastructure, where all the devices—a meteorological station, a sprinkler\
    \ system and\nhumidity sensors deployed a the ﬁeld; a base station installed near\
    \ the ﬁeld and connected to the\nnetwork infrastructure, which plays the role\
    \ of gateway between the network of sensors; and the\ninfrastructure—are in radio\
    \ range. Some works consider the issues of distances and of intermittent\nconnections—mainly\
    \ induced by the duty cycles of sensors for energy saving purposes—between the\n\
    Future Internet 2019, 11, 33\n3 of 19\ndevices, and solves them by adding redundant\
    \ relays and gateways to build a connected network.\nA few works dealing with\
    \ precision and sustainable agriculture propose to exploit the mobility of\ndevices\
    \ carried by people or embedded in agricultural vehicles (e.g., farm tractors\
    \ and agribots)\nin order to collect data generated by sensors or to deliver data\
    \ to actuators (e.g., sprinkler system\nand agribots). Such a collection process,\
    \ which leverages the contact opportunities between devices,\nis referred as being\
    \ opportunistic sensing.\nOpportunistic sensing and communication techniques,\
    \ which have an indubitable interest in\nthe agricultural domain, have also been\
    \ considered in a few systems that propose to exploit mobile\ndevices (carried\
    \ by people or embedded in vehicles) to collectively measure social or environmental\n\
    data in large-scale pervasive environments. These systems rely on opportunistic\
    \ and people-centric\nsensing techniques. They differ from ﬁrst-generation sensor\
    \ networks, not only in their goal to\nsupport concurrent people-centric and opportunistic\
    \ sensing applications in urban environments,\nbut also in their hardware and\
    \ software heterogeneity, high volatility, and very large scale. CarTel [12],\n\
    MetroSense [13], MobiScopes [14], SenseWeb [15], Urbanet [16] and Urban Atmospheres\
    \ [17] are\nexamples of such systems. To report information from a given region\
    \ using these systems, applications\nrun sensing tasks on the mobile devices that\
    \ are located in this region and that have chosen to\nparticipate to the sensing\
    \ process. Mobile devices report sensor data through opportunistic network\nconnections,\
    \ such as those they establish with third-party access points existing in their\
    \ radio range.\nFor instance in CarTel, a network node is a mobile device coupled\
    \ to a set of sensors. Each node\ngathers and processes sensor data locally before\
    \ delivering them to a central portal on the Internet,\nwhere the data are stored\
    \ in a database for further analysis and visualization. Mobile devices\nopportunistically\
    \ communicate, using their wireless interface (e.g., Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), with\
    \ other\nCarTel mobile devices and with Internet access points found in urban\
    \ areas. The portal and the\nmobile nodes use a delay-tolerant network stack,\
    \ called CafNet, to communicate. CarTel applications\nrun on the portal, and submit\
    \ SQL queries to a delay-tolerant continuous query processor called\nICEDB. This\
    \ query processor maintains a list of queries submitted by the applications, and\
    \ pushes\nthem to remote nodes using CafNet. It receives results from remote nodes,\
    \ and puts them into\na relational database. MetroSense adopts a similar approach,\
    \ and envisions a future Internet in\nwhich a large part of the data trafﬁc is\
    \ generated by sensors carried by people during their daily\nlife. BikeNet [18]\
    \ and CenceMe [19] are examples of applications based on the MetroSense system.\n\
    In BikeNet, bicycles equipped with multiple sensors communicated with neighboring\
    \ bikes as well as\nthe network infrastructure, and deliver sensing data to a\
    \ Web portal that promotes social networking\namong cyclists. Similarly, in CenceMe,\
    \ mobile phones collect data about a user’s activity and share it\nwith buddies\
    \ via a social network. Several other sensing applications have been proposed\
    \ by project\nUrban Atmospheres [17] and the MIT Senseable City Lab [20]. Project\
    \ SenseWeb proposes a Web-based\nplatform and tools to publish and query sensor\
    \ data across Internet. Sensors can measure various\nphysical variables, can be\
    \ static or mobile and carried by humans, or embedded in vehicles or on\nrobots.\
    \ To hide the heterogeneity and the intermittent connectivity of sensors, sensors\
    \ are connected\nto a gateway that provides a uniform interface to communicate\
    \ with them. Urbanet also focuses on\nsensing in spontaneous urban networks composed\
    \ of heterogeneous and potentially mobile sensors.\nHowever, unlike the above-mentioned\
    \ works, it does not rely on central collection points across\nthe Internet that\
    \ perform data and task management, and act as mediators between users and the\n\
    network. Urbanet proposes three middleware solutions to develop distributed sensing\
    \ applications\nthat do not require servers or Internet connectivity; sensing\
    \ applications running on mobile devices.\nThese solutions, respectively, present\
    \ the network: (1) as a distributed sensor database that can be\nqueried via a\
    \ SQL-like language; (2) as a single virtual name space that applications use\
    \ to access\nindividual resources offered by nodes; and (3) as a client-service\
    \ model where services migrate to\ndifferent network nodes to maintain a semantically\
    \ correct and continuous interaction with clients.\nThe above-mentioned works\
    \ have drawbacks regarding the opportunistic protocol they\nimplement, as well\
    \ as Web-based approach they propose. Indeed, similar to CafNet [21], opportunistic\n\
    Future Internet 2019, 11, 33\n4 of 19\nprotocols used in these works often rely\
    \ on a simple epidemic (nodes exchange with the other nodes\nthey encounter all\
    \ the messages they have). However, such an epidemic approach is known to not\n\
    be the more efﬁcient one, especially when there are many data to exchange; more\
    \ sophisticated and\nefﬁcient opportunistic protocols have indeed been proposed\
    \ to address the issues of the epidemic\nrouting protocol [22]. Moreover, these\
    \ works propose a Web portal that renders the data that have been\ncollected from\
    \ the sensors, and do not propose logical extensions of physical objects in the\
    \ Web that\nare able to provide a semantic description of these objects and of\
    \ their functionalities, and that offer\nmeans to conﬁgure and to control them\
    \ through Web standards and protocols. However, as mentioned\nin the Introduction,\
    \ such an approach offers signiﬁcant advantages, the physical Mashup being one\
    \ of\nthem. WoT solutions have been investigated in the agricultural context [23,24]\
    \ (and also in the smart\nhome context [25,26]) to improve the processing of dataﬂows\
    \ produced by sensors and to expose API\nof physical objects in the Web. Agri-IoT\
    \ [23] is a data analytics platform composed of multiple layers,\nallowing to\
    \ communicate with devices (lower layer), to analyze data (intermediate layers)\
    \ and to\npresent information to end-users either using dashboards or mobile applications\
    \ (higher layer). In this\nplatform, sensors, and the data they produce, are semantically\
    \ described using agricultural ontologies.\nHowever, again, these solutions do\
    \ not implement disruption-tolerant or opportunistic networking\ntechniques to\
    \ cope with the connectivity disruptions that can occur in smart agriculture and\
    \ farming\napplication domains, and more generally in scenarios involving mobile\
    \ devices communicating with\nshort range wireless interfaces.\nIn the next section,\
    \ we present a WoT dedicated platform called ASAWoO. This platform\nimplements\
    \ opportunistic networking and computing mechanisms, and addresses the drawbacks\
    \ of\nabove-presented works.\n3. Leveraging the Web of Things and the Opportunistic\
    \ Computing to Build Systems for the\nSmart Agriculture\nSmart agriculture mainly\
    \ consists in growing seedlings and plants while preserving natural\nresources\
    \ (e.g., water) and limiting crop protection products. To do so, both environmental\
    \ properties\n(soil moisture, ambient temperature, sunshine, etc.) and crop growth\
    \ are monitored using ﬁxed sensors\nor sensors embedded on ﬁeld machines, drones\
    \ or agribots. Collected data are compared to agricultural\ndata and models to\
    \ make decisions about the treatments to be performed and the means to achieve\n\
    them (traditional agricultural machines, agribots, and drones). We argue that\
    \ models, protocols,\ntechniques and approaches developed both in the WoT and\
    \ in the opportunistic computing can help\ndevelop and deploy cyber-physical systems\
    \ and applications dedicated to the smart agriculture. In the\nremainder of this\
    \ section, we develop and justify these words by explaining successively how the\n\
    opportunistic computing and the WoT can contribute to smart agriculture. Before\
    \ detailing these\ncontributions, we remind the key features of the opportunistic\
    \ computing and of the WoT.\n3.1. Contribution of the Opportunistic Computing\n\
    This subsection ﬁrst explains what opportunistic computing is and to what extent\
    \ it could beneﬁt\nsmart agriculture. Then, it thoroughly describes how a support\
    \ for opportunistic computing was\nimplemented in a Web of Things platform.\n\
    3.1.1. Deﬁnitions of Opportunistic Computing and Sensing, and Their Suitability\
    \ for Smart Agriculture\nOpportunistic networking is a research ﬁeld that can\
    \ be considered as being a derivative of the\nDelay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)\
    \ research domain. While DTN [27] characterizes networks with\nlong-delay communications\
    \ and/or with an unreliable connectivity, opportunistic networks denote\nmobile\
    \ networks that exploit transient—and sometimes non-predictable—radio contacts\
    \ between\nmobile devices to exchange data [28]. Opportunistic networking therefore\
    \ mostly targets disconnected\nmobile ad hoc networks (D-MANETs), as illustrated\
    \ on Figure 1. However, the differences between\nthese two approaches, which both\
    \ rely on the “store-carry-and-forward” principle, are marginal,\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2019, 11, 33\n5 of 19\nand both terms are indistinctly used in this paper. Numerous\
    \ opportunistic forwarding protocols\nhave been proposed over the past years [22],\
    \ investigating forwarding strategies based notably on\nepidemic approaches or\
    \ on social criteria (computed from mobility patterns, history of contacts or\n\
    location information). Opportunistic computing [29] is an extension of opportunistic\
    \ networking,\nwhere resources offered by devices are, in general, abstracted\
    \ and made available through services,\nthus allowing devices to access resources\
    \ provided by the devices they have encountered directly\nor via intermediate\
    \ devices. Opportunistic computing and networking do not make assumptions\nabout\
    \ the network topology and support frequent and unpredictable changes in this\
    \ one, as well as\nits fragmentation.\nFigure 1. Opportunistic networking in a\
    \ disconnected mobile network.\nSuch features make opportunistic computing and\
    \ networking interesting for the development\nof systems dedicated to the smart\
    \ agriculture. Unlike urban areas that may offer solid network\ninfrastructure\
    \ favorable to environmental sensing, farms are usually located in rural areas\
    \ where\nthe cellular network coverage is often lackluster and therefore does\
    \ not provide a reliable network\ninfrastructure. Furthermore, devices involved\
    \ in smart agriculture (e.g., sensors, agribots, and drones)\nare by nature likely\
    \ to fall in the D-MANET category, because devices may run out of battery or enter\
    \ a\nsleep mode for energy-saving purposes, and because mobile devices enter and\
    \ exit the communication\nradius of other nodes as they roam. Computing systems\
    \ relying on opportunistic communications,\nhowever, make it possible to collect\
    \ data generated by sparsely distributed sensors, even if these ones\nare not\
    \ up at the same time and/or if it does not exist an end-to-end path between some\
    \ sensors and\nthe gathering point. For this purpose, mobile devices (e.g., tractors,\
    \ agribots, drones, and smartphones\ncarried by farmers) can in addition be used\
    \ as “data mules” to collect data from sensors directly\nor to transfer data between\
    \ the different parts of the network that are isolated from one another.\nOpportunistic\
    \ computing furthermore allows farmers to deploy sensors or actuators in their\
    \ ﬁelds\nand/or in their farms, even on their animals [30], without having to\
    \ worry about the location, the radio\nrange, the duty cycle and the sleep phases\
    \ of these devices.\nFor the sake of illustration, let us consider a crop irrigation\
    \ management application that can\nprocess soil moisture data produced by sensors\
    \ deployed in agricultural ﬁelds, and that can trigger\nthe watering system if\
    \ the soil is too dry and if no rainfall is expected soon. As shown in Figure\
    \ 2,\ntwo farming vehicles A and B, which act as data mules in this smart agriculture\
    \ scenario, can participate\nto the collect of data and to their transmission\
    \ to the gateway, where they will be analyzed by a WoT\napplication in order to\
    \ decide if the watering system must be triggered or not. In Figure 2A, gateway\
    \ G\nemits a service invocation message to query sensor S. This message is stored\
    \ and carried by tractor A.\nIn Figure 2B, the tractor enters in the radio range\
    \ of sensor S, and delivers the message to S. Finally,\nin Figure 2C, the service\
    \ response sent by sensor S is forwarded back to the gateway G by tractor B,\n\
    which returns to its shelter located in the gateway vicinity. The experiment further\
    \ presented in this\npaper implemented a similar scenario.\nFuture Internet 2019,\

    \ tractor B forwards sensor data back\nto G.\n3.1.2. Opportunistic Computing Implementation\
    \ in ASAWoO Web of Things Platform\nIn project ASAWoO, we designed and developed\
    \ a disruption-tolerant RESTful support for the\nWoT [31]. In this opportunistic\
    \ computing implementation, resources offered by physical objects\nare identiﬁed\
    \ by URIs and accessed through stateless services. Service requests and responses\
    \ are\nforwarded using the “store-carry-and-forward” principle. This communication\
    \ support provides a\ncomplete service invocation model, allowing to perform unicast,\
    \ anycast, multicast and broadcast\nservice invocations using either HTTP or CoAP,\
    \ which makes it particularly suited for the WoT. It is\ncompliant with the six\
    \ constraints—the sixth one is optional—deﬁned by the REST architecture\nstyle\
    \ for performance, scalability and simplicity purposes.\nIndeed, it does not maintain\
    \ any\nsession state, and implements a loosely-coupled client/server architecture\
    \ where resources offered\nby physical objects are accessible through well deﬁned\
    \ service interfaces. By implementing the\n“store-carry-and-forward” principle,\
    \ it makes it possible to store service responses in the cache of\nclients and\
    \ of intermediate nodes, but also the service requests that have been sent in\
    \ the network.\nIntermediate hosts equipped with this communication system can\
    \ also act as proxies, and can respond\non behalf of a server if they have the\
    \ response in their local cache, when this one is still valid. Such an\napproach\
    \ improves the performance and the scalability of the system, because it naturally\
    \ performs\nload balancing and data caching on intermediate hosts, and thus fulﬁlls\
    \ both the “system layering”\nrequirement and the “response cacheablilty” requirement\
    \ promoted by the RESTful architecture\nstyle. Finally, as WoT applications can\
    \ be partially or fully developed in Javascript, a part of the\napplication can\
    \ be executed on the client side, thus allowing it to be compliant with REST optional\n\
    “code-on-demand” constraint, and to reduce the computation load on the physical\
    \ objects.\nAs with most disruption-tolerant communication systems, our system\
    \ implements a multiple\ncopy forwarding strategy. It can thus take advantage\
    \ of these message transmission models to increase\nthe message delivery probability\
    \ and to reduce the response time in a WoT context. For instance,\nseveral sensors\
    \ can simultaneously be invoked using a multicast transmission model without naming\n\
    them explicitly. All the responses returned by these sensors will be transmitted\
    \ to the client.\nThe system we have developed allows to invoke services using\
    \ the HTTP and CoAP\napplication-level protocols. The application-level messages\
    \ (i.e., HTTP and CoAP messages) can\nbe encapsulated in UDP datagrams, in TCP\
    \ segments or in messages of a given disruption-tolerant\ncommunication system\
    \ in order to be transmitted to their destination. Different wireless technologies\n\
    (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee) can be employed to communicate with physical\
    \ objects. As shown\nin Figure 3, this system is implemented by two main elements,\
    \ namely an HTTP/CoAP proxy and a\nDTN adapter. The HTTP/CoAP proxy makes it possible\
    \ for standard HTTP and CoAP clients and\nservers to send and receive service\
    \ requests and responses using disruption-tolerant communication\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2019, 11, 33\n7 of 19\ntechniques. Thanks to this proxy, programmers can develop\
    \ HTTP and CoAP WoT applications using\nregular HTTP and CoAP, libraries. Moreover,\
    \ standard HTTP and CoAP servers do not need to be\nmodiﬁed. This proxy can also\
    \ invoke remote REST services using Internet-legacy routing protocols\n(i.e.,\
    \ TCP/IP). The HTTP/CoAP proxy is a common element shared between all the implementations.\n\
    As for the DTN adapter, it binds the proxy and the disruption-tolerant communication\
    \ system in\ncharge of forwarding messages in the network. Hence, the DTN adapter\
    \ depends on the underlying\ncommunication system and is speciﬁcally developed\
    \ for each different system. Two adapters have been\ndeveloped: one relying on\
    \ the Bundle Protocol (BP) [32], which is the standard message-based protocol\n\
    over the DTN architecture [33], and another one relying on the C3PO opportunistic\
    \ communication\nplatform C3PO [34]. This platform provides interesting features\
    \ to implement the anycast, multicast\nand broadcast communication models efﬁciently.\
    \ For instance, service responses are used to stop the\npropagation of service\
    \ requests in the network, and messages can be restricted to a given geographical\n\
    area. In the experiment presented in the next section, we used the C3PO adapter.\
    \ The original and\nefﬁcient features implemented in this RESTful opportunistic\
    \ computing middleware support allows\nplatform ASAWoO to not have the same drawbacks\
    \ as those presented in Section 2, and make it an\ninteresting platform adapted\
    \ to the opportunistic sensing and to the smart agriculture and farming.\nFigure\
    \ 3. Overview of the implementation of the RESTful opportunistic computing middleware\
    \ support.\n3.2. Contribution of the Web of Things\nThe Web of Things allows controlling\
    \ and communicating with physical objects through the\nlogical software entities\
    \ that represent them in the Web, and via Web standards and protocols.\nThese\
    \ logical software entities allow: (1) describing the objects; (2) syntactically\
    \ and semantically\ndescribing functionalities (i.e., the Web services) providing\
    \ access to hardware capabilities of the\nphysical objects; (3) establishing communications\
    \ with the physical objects, by eventually adapting\nthe Web protocols and standards\
    \ to the proprietary protocols and data formats used by the objects;\nand (4)\
    \ providing environment to deliver and to run WoT applications. Thanks to these\
    \ logical software\nentities, physical objects can be combined together using\
    \ Web mashup techniques to create complex\ncyber-physical systems that can be,\
    \ for instance, designed for the smart agriculture. For instance,\na WoT application\
    \ built on the logical extensions of a crop irrigation system, of sensors deployed\n\
    in ﬁelds to measure soil moisture, and of a weather forecast Web service available\
    \ on the Internet,\ncould easily be developed using mashup techniques so as to\
    \ process data produced by sensors, and to\ntrigger the watering system if the\
    \ soil is too dry and if no rainfall is expected soon. As mentioned\nbefore, the\
    \ data generated by the sensors can be collected by data mules (e.g., tractors)\
    \ and transmitted\nto their logical representations deployed in a cloud infrastructure.\
    \ The application can query these\nlogical representations to obtain the environmental\
    \ measures, invoke a forecast Web service available\non the Internet, and decide\
    \ on the basis of these pieces of information to trigger the watering or not.\n\
    If so, this application will act on the watering system through its logical representation.\n\
    In the remainder of this section, we present the concept of Avatar [35] and the\
    \ middleware\nplatform we have proposed in project ASAWoO, and how they can be\
    \ used in a smart agriculture\nscenario similar to that described in the previous\
    \ lines. We also give a comparison of the concept of\nAvatars with the concept\
    \ of Servient proposed by the W3C [36].\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n8 of 19\n\
    3.2.1. Overview of the Avatar Concept\nThe purpose of an Avatar is to provide\
    \ device vendors, software developers and end-users with a\ncomprehensible abstraction\
    \ that makes physical objects accessible on the Web and that extends their\nstatus\
    \ and capabilities (processing, acting, sensing, etc.) into homogeneous and user-understandable\n\
    functionalities. An Avatar can be viewed as a “Web-based cyber-physical object”\
    \ that deﬁnes and\nembodies high-level behaviors for physical devices.\nAn Avatar\
    \ is composed of seven modules (see Figure 4). The interoperability module makes\
    \ it\npossible to conﬁgure and to manage the physical object linked to the Avatar.\
    \ It acts as an adaptation\nlayer that hides objects’ own protocols. The communication\
    \ module provides Avatar-to-Avatar and\nAvatar-to-Web-browser communications.\
    \ Different kinds of applicative protocols (e.g., HTTP and\nCoAP) and transport\
    \ protocols (UDP, TCP, and the disruption-tolerant protocol provided by\nthe opportunistic\
    \ communication support presented previously in this section) are supported to\n\
    communicate with the Avatars. Moreover, different wireless technologies are currently\
    \ supported\nto achieve communications with physical objects, such as Bluetooth,\
    \ Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct and XBee.\nThe functionality module manages the capabilities\
    \ and the functionalities of an Avatar. Similar to\nfunctionalities, capabilities\
    \ are pieces of code that make it possible to exploit the resources offered by\n\
    the physical objects. However, unlike functionalities—which are device independent—capabilities\n\
    depend on the physical objects. They can be viewed as implementations of elementary\
    \ functionalities.\nThanks to this approach, an agribot can for instance exposes\
    \ a higher-level of abstraction for the\nnavigation functionality that exploits\
    \ lower-level functionalities, such as GPS positioning and steering\ncapabilities.\
    \ Both capabilities and functionalities are described semantically. Reasoning\
    \ about semantic\ndescriptions of the capabilities and of the functionalities\
    \ help inferring complex functionalities\ninvolving sub-functionalities, thus\
    \ allowing to deﬁne high-level representations that better match the\nusers’ needs\
    \ than the low-level capabilities. Based on the inferences made by the semantic\
    \ reasoner,\nthe functionality manager can incrementally deploy new functionalities.\
    \ These functionalities are\nﬁltered by the context manager according to the information\
    \ it processes continuously, thus allowing\nto select the implementations of the\
    \ functionalities that are the most suited to the running conditions\nof the physical\
    \ object, as well as to perform dynamic adaptations. Various contextual properties\
    \ can\nbe taken into account, such as the location of the object, its processing\
    \ and memory capacities and its\npower budget. Functionalities are exposed as\
    \ REST services by the WoT module, and therefore can\nbe invoked remotely by WoT\
    \ applications (WoTApps) or by other Avatars for collaboration purposes.\nThe\
    \ WoT application container deploys and manages the life-cycle of WoTApps. WoTApps\
    \ can fully\nrun server-side (i.e., on the Avatar), be distributed and executed\
    \ both on the Avatar and in a Web\nbrowser, or be exclusively run in a Web browser.\
    \ Finally, Avatars implement a collaboration module\nrelying on an agent-based\
    \ approach. This module aims at endowing an autonomous behavior to the\nAvatar\
    \ and physical object, so that they can discover the functionalities they can\
    \ partially achieve and\nthat require the help of other Avatars to be performed.\
    \ After discovering the missing functionality in\nanother avatar, they can enrol\
    \ this Avatar to provide the functionality.\nThe main differences between the\
    \ proposition of the W3C for the WoT, called Servient [36],\nand the Avatar-based\
    \ models reside in the ability of Avatars to tolerate the connectivity disruptions,\n\
    to dynamically adapt their behavior and the functionalities they provide to their\
    \ running context,\nto automatically deploy new functionalities inferred on the\
    \ basis of the semantic description of more\nelementary ones, and to collaborate\
    \ with other Avatars. Indeed, similar to Avatars, Servients implement\na legacy\
    \ communication module that makes it possible to communicate with physical objects\
    \ using\nproprietary protocols, a protocol binding module that allows using several\
    \ types of applicative\nprotocols (MQTT, HTTP, and CoAP) to communicate with the\
    \ Servients, a model of resources and of\ndescription of objects, and a runtime\
    \ environment to run WoTApps. These differences between avatars\nand Servients\
    \ make Avatars more suited to develop cyber-physical systems that integrate autonomous\n\
    mobile objects, and therefore more adapted to systems dedicated to the smart agriculture\
    \ and farming.\nFurthermore, the reference implementation of the W3C standard\
    \ is not as mature as that proposed by\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n9 of 19\n\
    the ASAWoO project. Unlike the solutions proposed in [23–26], both Servients and\
    \ Avatars provide\nusers and developers with a comprehensive virtual representation\
    \ of physical objects to access and\ncontrol them. This uniﬁed resource representation\
    \ helps coping with device heterogeneity, which is\nnot well supported in Agri-IoT\
    \ according to its authors.\nInteroperability Module\nCommunication Module\nCollaboration\

    \ Avatar Runtime Environment\nTo conﬁgure themselves automatically, Avatars rely\
    \ on a set of semantic and code repositories,\nas represented in Figure 5.\nThese\
    \ repositories contain device setups, semantic descriptions\nof capabilities and\
    \ functionalities of Avatars and semantic descriptions of execution contexts.\n\
    The code repositories provide independent syntactic descriptions of REST interfaces\
    \ of functionalities,\nand speciﬁc implementations of capabilities, functionalities\
    \ and WoTApps. Most capabilities are device\ndependent, which is not the case\
    \ of the functionalities. The implementations of functionalities can still\ndiffer\
    \ for non-functional purposes such as quality of service requirements. Avatars\
    \ download pieces of\ncode from the code repositories and deploy them locally,\
    \ doing so they instantiate new capabilities\nand functionalities, and infer new\
    \ high-level ones progressively. Avatars are executed in a runtime\nenvironment\
    \ that manages their life-cycle and that exposes them in the Web. An Avatar is\
    \ instantiated\nin the runtime environment either automatically when a new physical\
    \ object is discovered in the local\narea network or when a user registers a new\
    \ device manually. The Avatar runtime environment and\nthe code repositories can\
    \ be installed either in a cloud platform, on a gateway, or even on a physical\n\
    object if this one has enough processing power and memory capacity. Needless to\
    \ say, the repositories\nand the Avatar runtime environments can be deployed on\
    \ separated devices.\n3.2.3. Technical Implementation\nThe ASAWoO runtime environment\
    \ is developed in Java and is based on the OSGi Apache\nFelix platform (http://felix.apache.org/).\
    \ It is designed as a set of services that are deployed using\nbundles (i.e.,\
    \ a JAR augmented with metadata), and that manage the life-cycle of Avatars. An\
    \ Avatar\n(i.e., the different modules and managers forming the Avatar’s architecture)\
    \ is also implemented as\na set of OSGi services. Conﬁguration ﬁles and the pieces\
    \ of code of capabilities, functionalities and\nWoTApps are also deployed using\
    \ bundles. Code repositories are implemented by OSGi Bundle\nRepositories (OBR),\
    \ which can be either local on remote. An OBR offers a customizable dependency\n\
    management that has been tuned to take into account functionalities and capabilities\
    \ requirements.\nThe semantic reasoner module depends on Apache Jena (https://jena.apache.org/)\
    \ inference engine\nand queries Fuseki SPARQL endpoints. In the current implementation,\
    \ the Vert.x (https://vertx.io/)\nstack is used to serve WoTApps and to expose\
    \ functionalities as REST services over HTTP. Vert.x\nhandler mechanism also helps\
    \ in managing asynchronous calls to functionalities. The opportunistic\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2019, 11, 33\n10 of 19\ncommunication module implementation based on\
    \ C3PO has already been thoroughly covered in\nSection 3.1.2 and in [31].\nASAWoO\

    This section describes the experiment conducted during four months in Montoldre\
    \ (France)\nexperimental farm in cooperation with IRSTEA (http://www.irstea.fr/en/research/research-units/\n\
    regions-jru). This experiment aimed ﬁrstly at evaluating the effective functioning\
    \ of the ASAWoO\nmidldleware platform and its performances in real conditions,\
    \ and secondly at studying the relevance\nand the viability of a Web of Thing\
    \ approach in an agricultural context.\n4.1. Presentation of the Experiment Environment\n\
    Montoldre experimental farm is a large plot of agricultural land dedicated to\
    \ the experimentation\nof agricultural techniques, especially fertilizer spreading\
    \ techniques. The area shown in the satellite\nview in Figure 6 is composed of\
    \ a dozen ﬁelds (in red) maintained by a handful of agricultural vehicles.\nThe\
    \ application considered in this ﬁrst experiment consisted in collecting environmental\
    \ data\n(humidity and temperature) measured by sensors. This experiment was run\
    \ in the early stages\nof ASAWoO development. Even though the whole middleware\
    \ was not complete at that time,\nthe opportunistic communication module was operational.\
    \ Hardened sensors that can be exposed\nto bad weather conditions were also not\
    \ ready to use for this experiment. Consequently, we used\ntiny single-board computers\
    \ (RaspberryPis) equipped with Wi-Fi antennas that produce data exactly\nas the\
    \ sensors would have done. As these devices are not hardened, they were placed\
    \ in farm\nbuildings, as shown in Figure 7. These experimental conditions may\
    \ appear as degraded, but are not\nin reality because the communication behavior\
    \ of sensors was reproduced as accurately as possible.\nThis experiment allowed\
    \ us to validate the RESTful opportunistic communication support presented\nin\
    \ Section 3.\nThree instances of ASAWoO runtime were deployed on Raspberry Pis\
    \ equipped with 5 dB Wi-Fi\nantennas. The ﬁrst one, identiﬁed as RASP00, acted\
    \ as a base station located in IRSTEA ofﬁce at\nthe limit of Wi-Fi communication\
    \ range from the tractors’ warehouse. The two other RaspberryPis\n(RASP01 and\
    \ RASP02) were equipped with an external battery pack and a GPS module. The kits\
    \ were\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n11 of 19\nembedded on two tractors. GPS\
    \ antennas were placed on the tractors’ roofs and the battery power\ncords were\
    \ plugged into the tractors’ cigarette lighters to power up/on the Raspberry and\
    \ recharge.\nTwo other self-powered RaspberryPis with smaller range acting as\
    \ sensors were deployed in farm\nbuildings located on tractors paths. Locations\
    \ of the ﬁve nodes are shown on the map in Figure 7.\nThe embedded system deployed\
    \ on sensors was restricted to ASAWoO communication module since\nthe whole middleware\
    \ stack was not required. During this experiment, the sensors produced data\n\
    every 30 min.\nFigure 6. Montoldre experiment farm.\nFigure 7. Node locations\
    \ and their approximate communication ranges.\nDuring the four months of experimentation,\
    \ over 30 trips were monitored. Mobility traces of\nRASP01 and RASP02 (i.e., tractors)\
    \ were stored in log ﬁles, as well as the contacts and exchanges\nFuture Internet\
    \ 2019, 11, 33\n12 of 19\nbetween tractors and the base station). Logs were compiled\
    \ and sent to the base station when entering\nits radio range. A ssh tunnel between\
    \ the base station at IRSTEA and our lab was established to access\nthe logs,\
    \ update the code if necessary, and remotely monitor the experiment throughout\
    \ its progress.\nThe following subsection presents the experiment outcomes, focusing\
    \ on a few trips involving both\ntractors or longer activity periods.\n4.2. Experiment\
    \ Results\nAfter four months of sparse activity, logs gathered on the base station\
    \ were compiled, sanitized\nand analyzed. Since the two equipped tractors were\
    \ rarely operating simultaneously, we focused on\nthe logs of days providing the\
    \ most extensive data. A summary of the activity during these days\nis presented\
    \ in Table 1. Day 1 was the experiment setup; we checked that communication was\
    \ well\nestablished between the three nodes, and moved RASP01 and RASP02 to make\
    \ them enter and exit\ncommunication range with each other and with sensors. On\
    \ Day 3, the tractor carrying RASP01 was\nspreading fertilizer, and on Day 4 it\
    \ sowed the ﬁelds. Day 5 featured the longer trip from RASP02.\nTable 1. Data\

    Table 2 compiles global observations made throughout the experiment. When tractors\
    \ were\nactive, we reported an average speed of 16 km/h, which was not an hindrance\
    \ to message delivery.\nOpportunistic sensing and the data mule approach is therefore\
    \ a viable solution in the agricultural\ncontext where vehicles speed is moderate.\
    \ Although cellular network coverage was quite poor on\nMontoldre site, opportunistic\
    \ networking via ad hoc Wi-Fi proved to be effective to convey small\nmessages\
    \ such as environmental data. Under the right circumstances, the communication\
    \ range\nexceeded our expectations with a recorded maximum range of 468 m. This\
    \ result is further supported\nby Figure 8, which shows the number of actual contacts\
    \ at a given time between two nodes versus an\nestimate derived from the actual\
    \ node positions and a ﬁxed range of 200 m. More often than not, actual\ncontacts\
    \ were established, whereas the estimate did not consider the nodes to be within\
    \ radio range.\nTable 2. Tractors average speed and radio-contact range.\nAverage\

    \ which the nodes are in contact and can\ncommunicate) are presented in Figure\
    \ 9. On Day 5, half of the contacts lasted less than 3 min while\nonly a tenth\
    \ of the contacts exceeded 10 min. The few contacts exceeding 1 h were due to\
    \ RASP02\ninstance remaining active in the warehouse, within range of the base\
    \ station. The relatively moderate\nspeed of the tractors combined with the long\
    \ range Wi-Fi interfaces resulted in long enough contacts\nallowing for wide communication\
    \ time periods. Since the size of exchanged messages, whether they\nwere gossiping\
    \ relating to the opportunistic communication protocol or sensor data, was quite\
    \ small\n(a few bytes), such a time frame is sufﬁcient to perform opportunistic\
    \ sensing (i.e., collect sensor data\nand opportunistically forward these data).\n\

    \ smoothly. Sometimes\nthe RaspberryPi was slow to receive the GPS signal, which\
    \ not only led to missing positions, but also\nto clock desynchronization and\
    \ erroneous timestamps since the system clock was set to GPS time.\nHowever, logs\
    \ could be resynchronized using contacts and exchanged messages with the base\
    \ station.\nDue to farming vehicle vibrations, sometimes the device got its GPS\
    \ antenna or its power cord\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n14 of 19\nunplugged,\
    \ and the shutdown and powering up that should have been controlled by the battery\
    \ was\nnot always done properly, which led to corrupted log ﬁles that had to be\
    \ discarded or corrected. In a\nconcrete deployment, kits should be designed and\
    \ built to better ﬁt the speciﬁcities of agricultural\nvehicles (e.g., with antivibration\
    \ material, properly integrated power management and a CMOS\nclock battery).\n\
    Lastly, the ﬁnal encountered issue was the considerable size of the covered area\
    \ combined with\nthe fact that the two equipped vehicles were hardly running together,\
    \ which resulted in too few\ncontacts between the mobile nodes outside the vicinity\
    \ of their rallying point (the warehouse). The lack\nof contact data does not\
    \ affect the effectiveness of opportunistic sensing nonetheless. Even though\n\
    contacts are more likely to occur in the rallying point area, tractors are still\
    \ able to retrieve data from\nfaraway sensors and forward it to the base station.\
    \ The two mobile ASAWoO instances were indeed\nable to successfully gather data\
    \ from sensors up to the base station without a permanent connectivity\nbetween\
    \ each node.\n4.3. Evaluation of the Web of Things Approach\nThe experiment described\
    \ in the previous section focused on the validation of ASAWoO\nopportunistic communication\
    \ capabilities, whereas the Web of Things aspect could not be tested\nat that\
    \ time. WoT modules were nonetheless still validated in the later stages of ASAWoO\
    \ development\nin another experiment, which is brieﬂy presented in this subsection.\
    \ During the Montoldre experiment,\nASAWoO middleware mainly consisted of the\
    \ Avatar core, the functionalities management and\nregistry features (i.e., functionalities\
    \ were advertised as RESTful services) as well as the opportunistic\ncommunication\
    \ module. The second experiment was run in Bordeaux, France. It introduced the\n\
    device manager and the semantic reasoning features to instantiate capabilities,\
    \ simple and composite\nfunctionalities, as well as the WoT Application module.\
    \ Unlike the farm experiment, which spanned\nover four months, this one lasted\
    \ only one day. Since the communication module had already been\nvalidated in\
    \ the long-run experiment, the goal was to validate ASAWoO ﬁnal stage, particularly\
    \ the\nWoT related modules (e.g., WoTApp manager, automatic instantiation of functionalities\
    \ from device\nconﬁgurations and semantic repositories, etc.).\nThis experiment\
    \ was based on the same data collection WoTApp and the same hardware kits.\nAlthough\
    \ the Raspberry Pi-based kits (with GPS module and Wi-Fi interface) were reused,\
    \ this time\nthe data mule was a robot, the Jackal all-terrain mobile platform\
    \ (https://www.clearpathrobotics.\ncom/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/),\
    \ on which was deployed an instance of ASAWoO\nhosting its own Avatar. Figure\
    \ 10 shows a picture of the robot and the packaged base station kit on the\nexperimentation\
    \ ﬁeld. In addition to its navigation capabilities, a camera was mounted on the\
    \ platform.\nA ROS (Robot Operating System: http://www.ros.org/) bridge interoperability\
    \ module was developed\nfor ASAWoO to expose these capabilities, which in turn\
    \ enabled higher level functionalities such as\nperson detection and video surveillance.\
    \ The video surveillance and the navigation functionalities\nwere then combined\
    \ to provide a patrol functionality.\nThe scenario written for this experiment\
    \ consisted in making the robot patrol from sensor to\nsensor to collect data\
    \ as long as it did not encounter a person. If the video surveillance functionality\n\
    triggered an alarm, the reasoning module would give priority to the patrol functionality\
    \ and use the\nnavigation functionality to go back to a rallying point. This scenario\
    \ is illustrated on ASAWoO code\nrepository homepage (https://asawoo.gitlab.io/).\n\
    During the experiment, all devices hosting an ASAWoO platform were accessible\
    \ through their\nsecond Wi-Fi interface set on access point mode. When connecting\
    \ to a device’s main WoTApp,\nwe could navigate through its neighbors and query\
    \ their functionalities. Figure 11 presents a screenshot\nof the main WoTApp hosted\
    \ on the robot. It features system functionalities (e.g., functionalities registry,\n\
    neighborhood, device conﬁguration and WoTApp deployment), as well as other Avatars\
    \ whose remote\nfunctionalities can be reached through multi-hop asynchronous\
    \ DTN RESTful requests. The screenshot\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n15 of 19\n\
    shows a JSON-formatted GPS position in response to a GET request sent to a sensor’s\
    \ LocationService\nfunctionality. The retrieved sensor data were also displayed\
    \ on the data collection WoTApp.\nFigure 10. All-terrain mobile platform running\
    \ ASAWoO next to the base station kit.\nFigure 11. Screenshot of ASAWoO administration\
    \ WoTApp.\nIt is worth noting that, although this paper mainly focuses on sensing\
    \ functionalities, ASAWoO\nalso supports actuators and the conclusions that we\
    \ drew also apply to this class of devices. The general\npractice that has been\
    \ followed in ASAWoO was to bind actuator functionalities to PUT and POST\nHTTP\
    \ methods, while GET methods were used for sensor functionalities. In the patrol\
    \ surveillance\nscenario, the navigation functionality is an example of an actuator\
    \ functionality. Results regarding\ncontext adaptation and semantic reasoning\
    \ performances are presented in [37].\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n16 of 19\n\
    4.4. Results Discussion\nDuring the second experiment, the WoT approach allowed\
    \ us to successfully interact with different\ndevices through their logical representations.\
    \ Devices heterogeneity was indeed hidden behind Avatars\nusing web standards\
    \ (JSON over HTTP requests). The web browsers from a laptop, a smartphone or a\n\
    tablet were used interchangeably.\nBoth experiments were conclusive regarding\
    \ the opportunistic computing aspect. The monitored\ncontact durations and distances\
    \ between mobile and/or static nodes, resulting from the data mules\nspeed and\
    \ their communication range, both support the idea that opportunistic sensing\
    \ is a possible\noption for smart agriculture. The communication range measured\
    \ in the second experiment conﬁrmed\nthe ﬁrst results with a maximum range of\
    \ 283 m between the base station and the robot. We however\nobserved that farming\
    \ vehicles were not operating on a daily basis whereas data gathering depends\n\
    on their operation frequency for an opportunistic sensing approach entirely relies\
    \ on nodes mobility.\nEven though the following perspective is beyond the scope\
    \ of this article, we argue that the node\ndensity issue can be addressed by emulation\
    \ techniques. At the end of the ﬁrst experiment, we obtained\nvaluable data on\
    \ the mobility of farming vehicles in actual conditions. These mobility data could\
    \ be\nmade available on a service such as CRAWDAD (https://crawdad.org/) and leveraged\
    \ with simulation\ntools such as LEPTON [38] which is an emulation platform for\
    \ opportunistic networking development.\nLEPTON allows the execution of functional\
    \ code to run in an emulated environment under controlled\nand repeatable conditions,\
    \ where only the mobility of nodes is simulated. The possibility to replay\nscenarios\
    \ based on actual tractors paths gives the opportunity to evaluate our approach\
    \ under different\nconditions and therefore to ﬁnely tune scenario parameters\
    \ such as the number of data mules, their\npaths and speed, or the positions of\
    \ sensors, without starting over an actual experimental campaign.\nThus, testing\
    \ different smart agriculture scenarios could indeed help in deducing an optimal\
    \ setup to\nimprove opportunistic sensing solutions for precision agriculture.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThe Internet of Things will become a reality when connected object\
    \ makers propose off-the-shelf\ncyber-physical objects that can communicate and\
    \ interoperate through open standard protocols and\ndata formats, or that can\
    \ be connected to Web of Things (WoT) platforms that bridge the gap between\n\
    proprietary protocols and Web standard formats and protocols. Such objects and\
    \ platforms appear\nas attractive solutions to build complex systems, notably\
    \ for environmental sensing and for smart\nagriculture and farming. Nevertheless,\
    \ in challenging environments, such as in agricultural and\nfarming environments,\
    \ it is often difﬁcult to deploy systems relying exclusively on infrastructure-based\n\
    networks because rural areas often have poor network coverage, and because there\
    \ are frequent and\nunpredictable connectivity disruptions resulting from both\
    \ the mobility of agricultural machines (e.g.,\ntractors, agribots, and drones)\
    \ communicating with short range radio interfaces and from the sleep\nphases kept\
    \ by some devices for energy saving purposes.\nIn this paper, we present how opportunistic\
    \ computing can be combined with the WoT to\ncontribute to the smart agriculture,\
    \ and how such an approach was implemented in a middleware\nplatform called ASAWoO.\
    \ Opportunistic computing and networking techniques leverage the mobility\nof\
    \ agricultural machines to provide intermittent connectivity between physical\
    \ objects that would not\nhave been connected by any route otherwise. This platform\
    \ provides a virtual representation of the\nphysical objects in the Web, called\
    \ Avatars, which give access to the objects functionalities in order to\nallow\
    \ WoT users to interact with devices at a higher level of abstraction.\nASAWoO\
    \ platform was evaluated in a practical smart agriculture scenario through a four-month\n\
    experiment.\nTwo tractors carried ASAWoO instances responsible for collecting\
    \ data of sensors\ndisseminated in an experimental farm. Experiment results show\
    \ that ASAWoO platform was able to\nperform environmental sensing using opportunistic\
    \ computing in real conditions, and that the low\npace of farming vehicles makes\
    \ opportunistic computing possible in the agricultural context. Based\non these\
    \ outcomes, we conclude that both the integration of sensors and actuators such\
    \ as agribots\nFuture Internet 2019, 11, 33\n17 of 19\nin WoT applications, and\
    \ the implementation of opportunistic computing mechanisms are likely to\nimprove\
    \ agricultural practices and compensate for the potential lack of network infrastructure.\
    \ Such an\napproach is not limited to smart agriculture and farming, and could\
    \ also be transposed to other related\ncritical contexts such as disaster relief.\n\

    Abstract: Climate change has reduced the availability of good quality water for\
    \ agriculture, while\nfavoring the proliferation of harmful insects, especially\
    \ in Mediterranean areas. Deploying IoT-\nbased systems can help optimize water-use\
    \ efﬁciency in agriculture and address problems caused\nby extreme weather events.\
    \ This work presents an IoT-based monitoring system for obtaining soil\nmoisture,\
    \ soil electrical conductivity, soil temperature and meteorological data useful\
    \ in irrigation\nmanagement and pest control. The proposed system was implemented\
    \ and evaluated for olive parcels\nlocated both at coastal and inland areas of\
    \ the eastern part of Crete; these areas face severe issues\nwith water availability\
    \ and saltwater intrusion (coastal region). The system includes the monitoring\n\
    of soil moisture and atmospheric sensors, with the aim of providing information\
    \ to farmers for\ndecision-making and at the future implementation of an automated\
    \ irrigation system, optimizing\nthe use of water resources. Data acquisition\
    \ was performed through smart sensors connected to a\nmicrocontroller. Data were\
    \ received at a portal and made available on the cloud, being monitored\nin real-time\
    \ through an open-source IoT platform. An e-mail alert was sent to the farmers\
    \ when\nsoil moisture was lower than a threshold value speciﬁc to the soil type\
    \ or when climatic conditions\nfavored the development of the olive fruit ﬂy.\
    \ One of the main advantages of the proposed decision-\nmaking system is a low-cost\
    \ IoT solution, as it is based on open-source software and the hardware on\nedge\
    \ devices consists of widespread economic modules. The reliability of the IoT-based\
    \ monitoring\nsystem has been tested and could be used as a support service tool\
    \ offering an efﬁcient irrigation and\npest control service.\nKeywords: agricultural\
    \ water management; decision support system; soil moisture; EC; smart sensor;\n\
    Internet of Things; remote sensing\n1. Introduction\nIrrigated agriculture is\
    \ the sector that contributes the most to total water withdrawals\nin the main\
    \ olive oil producing Mediterranean countries, with a share of about 75% of\n\
    total water withdrawals on average [1]. However, increased water demand from other\n\
    sectors such as tourism and climate change will limit the available water resources\
    \ for\nagriculture in the coming decades and affect water quantity and quality.\
    \ Efﬁcient use of\nirrigation water is a key factor in resolving water scarcity\
    \ issues, but it is also important for\noptimizing crop yields. The limited availability\
    \ of water increases the interest of growers to\nsave water by improved irrigation\
    \ scheduling, as the cost of water rises. Thus, accurate\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ remains a major challenge for growers [2,3].\nTo mitigate climate-water impacts\
    \ on agricultural production, proper and sustainable\nagricultural practices related\
    \ to water, soil and crops should be adopted by growers. Espe-\ncially growers\
    \ in arid and semi-arid orchard environments, who face signiﬁcant problems\nwith\
    \ water availability, water salinity due to saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers\
    \ as\nwell as occasional outbreaks of pest infestation. Thus, irrigation and pest/disease\
    \ control\nWater 2023, 15, 1739. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15091739\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/water\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 1739\n2 of 18\nrequire accurate management for optimizing crop\
    \ productivity, water-use efﬁciency and\ndiminishing environmental impacts [4].\
    \ In such environments, there is a potential to im-\nprove water-use efﬁciency\
    \ through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of\nwireless communication\
    \ technologies, monitoring systems and advanced control strategies\nfor optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling [5].\nAdopting irrigation management strategies to increase\
    \ water-use efﬁciency such as\ndeﬁcit irrigation [6] or smart irrigation systems\
    \ [7] requires several sensors to monitor soil\nwater availability. The assessment\
    \ of the water status of plants is usually performed with\nsoil moisture sensors\
    \ that provide data on the volumetric content of water in the soil [8].\nDepending\
    \ on their technology, these sensors provide an analog or digital signal and have\n\
    the ability to communicate with recorders. In recent years, in addition to moisture\
    \ sensors,\nsmart sensors have been developed that simultaneously measure electrical\
    \ conductivity\nand soil temperature in addition to moisture [9].\nThe rapid development\
    \ of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to the use of\nsensors with minimal\
    \ need for wiring and great improvements in their installation and\nmaintenance\
    \ [10–12]. A wireless sensor network consists of several spatially distributed\n\
    measurement points, called nodes, that communicate wirelessly with each other.\
    \ The\ndata received from each of them is stored in a central hub and processed\
    \ for irrigation\nmanagement. The weakness of such systems is that they use a\
    \ central communication\nstructure (gateway) to communicate with the end user,\
    \ which can lead to the collapse of\nthe entire system if this device has limited\
    \ connectivity [13].\nGenerally, the Internet of Things (IoT) refers as a cluster\
    \ of physical objects that are\nintegrated with multiple sensors, processing capability,\
    \ software and other technologies\nthat facilitate communication with other devices\
    \ and the cloud. IoT-based systems exchange\ndata without having physical interaction\
    \ with the user and suppliers through different\nmodern wireless technologies\
    \ and network solutions [14]. The evolution of mobile networks\nand the development\
    \ of the IoT has made mobile Internet communications (GSM/GPRS,\nLTE, and NB)\
    \ inexpensive. This enabled more ﬂexibility in the deployment of nodes in\na wireless\
    \ network as each node contains a mobile communication unit. In this way, the\n\
    topology of the network is changed from centralized to distributed, resulting\
    \ in minimal\nimpact on the operation of the network in the case of a single-node\
    \ connection failure.\nThe disadvantage of the mobile network is the increased\
    \ energy requirements for the\ntransmission of the signals from the nodes, so\
    \ careful planning should be adopted to ensure\nthe lowest possible energy consumption\
    \ [15].\nThe use of sophisticated soil moisture and environmental sensors combined\
    \ with\nappropriate recorders allows the application of algorithms to automatically\
    \ estimate the\namount of water needed and apply it at the right time [16]. They\
    \ also enable agricultural\nalerts to be automatically sent when weather conditions\
    \ favor the development of diseases\nor pests, so that farmers can take appropriate\
    \ protective measures. As we move towards\nenhancing decision-making to support\
    \ farmers and growers, the analysis of sensor data\nand exploiting intelligent\
    \ scheduling of processes within a uniﬁed platform and framework\nis crucial [17,18].\
    \ Today, a large number of companies offering platforms for sensor data\nvisualization\
    \ are available in the market [19–22]. However, they require skilled farmers\n\

    Most of these platforms are basically commercial and often have high costs, which\
    \ prevents\nthe farmer from adopting them [23]. Previous researchers developed\
    \ open IoT platforms\nfor agriculture [24,25] but none of them combines scalability,\
    \ multi-tenancy, cartographic\nbackground environment and creation of alerts when\
    \ the value of a measurement passes a\npredetermined threshold. The novelty of\
    \ this work is that it combines a decision support\nsystem for irrigation and\
    \ plant protection with the above features connected with energy\nefﬁcient low-cost\
    \ end devices.\nWithin this context, this work presents the design and implementation\
    \ of a decision\nsupport system (DSS) through a low-cost IoT-based platform that\
    \ provides irrigation man-\nagement and plant protection advice to Mediterranean\
    \ olive farmers. For this purpose, a\nWater 2023, 15, 1739\n3 of 18\nnetwork of\
    \ reliable sensors was created to measure important soil and climate parameters\
    \ in\nthe areas of interest. Sensor data being stored in a database of an open-source\
    \ IoT platform\ninstalled on the premises. Irrigation dose is estimated through\
    \ a real-time computation,\nbased on soil information, while weather information\
    \ assists decision-making regarding\nplant protection. The proposed platform,\
    \ through its capabilities, can effectively support\nthe use of irrigation water\
    \ towards increasing water productivity (ratio between the actual\nyield of the\
    \ crop and the total water involved in crop production). In addition, based on\n\
    the olive ﬂy alerts provided by the platform, the user can act at the right time\
    \ to minimize\nthe risk of pest infestation that could affect production and reduce\
    \ environmental impact\nthrough the correct use of pesticides.\nThis manuscript\
    \ is organized into the following two major sections. The section “Mate-\nrials\
    \ and methods”, which includes information about the study area, the IoT platform,\
    \ the\nirrigation model and the irrigation strategies–olive fruit ﬂy alarm rules.\
    \ The section “Imple-\nmentation and discussion”, which includes information about\
    \ the device implementation\n(IoT-based monitoring system), the user interface-scheduled\
    \ alarms for irrigation/pest\ncontrol and beneﬁts of the proposed system as well\
    \ as steps for further improvements.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\n\
    In this study, an IoT platform system supporting optimal irrigation and decision-\n\
    making approaches in olive growing regions was developed in two nearby pilot areas\
    \ at\nthe eastern part of the Island of Crete, as part of the AgriCapture CO2\
    \ HORIZON project.\nThe ﬁrst area is located on the coastal side and the other\
    \ on the inland side (Figure 1).\nIn general, in the study areas, more than 82%\
    \ of the total water used is consumed for\nirrigation purposes, while over 92%\
    \ of the total water supply comes from groundwater [26].\nConsidering that the\
    \ agricultural sector is the primary consumer of water in Crete and\nthe study\
    \ areas face the most acute issues with water availability and saltwater intrusion,\n\
    developing an easy-to-use and low-cost smart irrigation and decision-making system\
    \ for\nensuring water-use efﬁciency is a great task.\nSince olives are the dominant\
    \ crop in the eastern part of Crete, and thus in both studied\nareas, four experimental\
    \ drip irrigated olive groves were selected for each area to develop\nthe proposed\
    \ smart irrigation and decision-making system (Figure 1). These experimen-\ntal\
    \ sites were selected based on different criteria such as (a) soil and geomorphological\n\
    characteristics, (b) climatic conditions, (c) water availability, (d) the existence\
    \ of water\nsalinity due to saltwater intrusion, (e) the agricultural practices\
    \ already applied in the\nparcels and (f) the small size of each experimental\
    \ parcel (area of about 0.2 ha) to ensure,\nwithin the same parcel, the lowest\
    \ possible variability of the soil or/and geomorphology\ncharacteristics. The\
    \ aim of this selection was to capture the typical range of olive grove\ncharacteristics\
    \ in eastern Crete, including the heterogeneity of climate, soil, topography and\n\
    cropping systems.\nIn January 2021 a sampling campaign took place at the 8 studied\
    \ parcels. The soil\nsamples were collected from a representative olive grove\
    \ soil depth of 20–40 cm and\nanalyzed in the laboratory. Table 1 describes the\
    \ main soil properties as well as the\nclimatological/geomorphological conditions\
    \ of the 8 experimental parcels.\nBased on this table, 4 out of the 8 experimental\
    \ parcels are classiﬁed in the medium\ntexture class, 2 are classiﬁed in the medium–ﬁne\
    \ soil texture class, and the remaining\n2 experimental parcels are classiﬁed\
    \ in the coarse texture class. Additionally, values of\norganic matter, bulk density,\
    \ rocks, and Ca+2 percentages as well as values of pH are noted\nin Table 1. In\
    \ the coastal area the soil is alkaline with a higher percentage of carbonates.\n\
    Regarding the inland studied area, the majority of the soil is considered light\
    \ alkaline with\na minimal presence of carbonates. Also noted on Table 1, the\
    \ percentage of rocks at the\nexperimental parcels has an extensive range between\
    \ 3.31 and 32.52%. All these values\ncorrespond to the typical values of soil\
    \ where the eastern Cretan olive groves are located [4].\nWater 2023, 15, 1739\n\
    4 of 18\nConsidering the climate conditions, one weather station was installed\
    \ in each area\ncovering and monitoring all the different climatological conditions\
    \ between the coastal and\ninland sites (Figure 1). Generally, the olive parcels\
    \ located in both areas are characterized\nby mild winters and dry summers with\
    \ mean daily temperatures around 19.4 ◦C for the\ncoastal area and 18.1 ◦C for\
    \ the inland area, while the mean annual precipitation is around\n435.6 in the\
    \ coastal area and 680.2 mm in the inland area (Table 1).\nAdditionally, of high\
    \ importance is that the parcels (A, B, C and D) located on the\ncoastal studied\
    \ area face the problem of saline water as an effect of seawater intrusion in\n\
    the coastal aquifers, which leads to the decrease in the available freshwater\
    \ storage volume\nand the simultaneous pollution of extracted irrigation wells.\
    \ Table 1 depicts the levels of\nECw in the irrigation water. Thus, in these sites\
    \ a proper saltwater irrigation management\nplan based on soil electrical conductivity\
    \ monitoring levels is also proposed within the\ncontext of the developed IoT\
    \ platform.\nWater 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n4 of 20 \n \n \nFigure 1. Spatial\

    \ per tree of each parcel were determined based on the meteorological\ndata (recorded\
    \ by the nearby weather station) using the Penman equation (FAO56 version).\n\
    In addition, as a parallel and more accurate process, the soil moisture data were\
    \ used to\nconﬁrm or reduce/postpone the need for the applied irrigation dose\

    \ is responsible for calculating the\nweekly amount of water that olive trees\
    \ need to reach the desired soil moisture level. It\ncan be used for any irrigation\
    \ method, but in this case, it concerns drip irrigation as it is\nthe dominant\
    \ irrigation method for the speciﬁc areas. Speciﬁcally, each node (soil sensor)\n\
    every week automatically calculates the amount of water needed to reach the desired\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 1739\n9 of 18\nsoil moisture level for the corresponding studied\
    \ parcel, in turn the system sends a mail\nalarm notiﬁcation to the farmer to\

    \ model, the \nestimation of the van Genuchten water retention curve is a task\
    \ of high importance. A \ncommon addressed scientific practice to predict soil\
    \ hydraulic parameters (unsaturated \nsoils) is the use of the Rosetta pedotransfer\
    \ model. This model allows the estimation of \nFigure 5. A ﬂow chart of the incorporated\
    \ irrigation model.\nTo effectively incorporate soil moisture data into the proposed\
    \ irrigation model, the\nestimation of the van Genuchten water retention curve\
    \ is a task of high importance. A\ncommon addressed scientiﬁc practice to predict\
    \ soil hydraulic parameters (unsaturated\nsoils) is the use of the Rosetta pedotransfer\
    \ model. This model allows the estimation of van\nGenuchten water retention parameters\
    \ using limited input data such as the soil texture [28].\nNevertheless, for more\
    \ robust and accurate results, it is highly suggested to measure and\ntest all\
    \ the hydraulic soil parameters through laboratory analysis [29]. Thus, using\
    \ the soil\nhydraulic parameters calculated by Rosetta or by laboratory analysis,\
    \ the van Genuchten\nequation can be used to determine the soil water retention\
    \ curve [30,31]:\nθ(h) = θr +\nθs − θr\n\x02\n1 + (αh)n\x03(m)\nwhere θ(h) is\
    \ the soil water content (L3L−3) at a matric potential h, θs is the saturated\
    \ water\ncontent (L3L−3), θr is the residual water content (L3L−3), α is related\
    \ to the inverse of the\nair entry suction (L−1) and m and n are empirical parameters\
    \ determining the shape of the\nsoil water retention curve where m = 1 − 1/n.\n\
    In turn, with the calculated water retention curve, the total available soil water\
    \ (TAW)\ncan be assessed as the difference between the volumetric soil water content\
    \ of ﬁled capacity\nWater 2023, 15, 1739\n10 of 18\n(FC) and permanent wilting\
    \ point (PWP) multiplied by the effective root depth. The FC\nand the PWP were\
    \ estimated according to the Saxton equation [32]. Moreover, another\nimportant\
    \ term is the fraction of TAW that a crop can extract from the root zone without\n\
    suffering water stress, named as readily available soil water (RAW).\nConsidering\
    \ that irrigated olive trees have a relatively shallow root system, it is\nessential\
    \ to apply water at the effective root zone, reducing the deep percolation. Depending\n\
    on the soil type, the olive grove’s effective root zone is usually up to 30 cm\
    \ in soil depth [33].\nAt that depth, there is a minimum threshold of critical\
    \ matric potential, the lower limit\nof the readily available water (RAWLLim),\
    \ which needs to be maintained. The typical\nthreshold for olive trees ranges\
    \ from—30 to −100 kpa depending on the phenological\nstage [34,35].\nAnother beneﬁt\
    \ of the proposed irrigation model is that it issues differentiated recom-\nmendations\
    \ for saline water irrigation. For olive cultivation, irrigation water is considered\n\
    to be of low quality when the ECw is greater than 3 dS/m. The main negative effects\
    \ of\nirrigation with saline water are (a) clogging of drippers, (b) making the\
    \ soil water osmotic\npotential more negative so that the roots cannot absorb\
    \ water efﬁciently, (c) causing root\nand plant toxicity, as well as (d) destruction\
    \ of the soil structure (reduction of soil water\nholding capacity). In cases\
    \ when there is not enough rainfall during consecutive years, salts\nwill gradually\
    \ accumulate from year to year leading to the destruction of soil texture and\n\
    desertiﬁcation [36–38].\nAccording to [39] the olive yield is reduced by about\
    \ 10% when the electrical con-\nductivity of the soil saturation extract (ECe)\
    \ ranges from 4 to6 dS/m. The authors of [40]\nproposed a mathematical approach\
    \ which correlates the ECe and the soil electrical conduc-\ntivity (ECa) with\
    \ various soil properties. Thus, based on this approach, the ECe threshold\nof\
    \ 4–6 dS/m for olive trees was converted to the corresponding threshold values\
    \ of ECa in\nour study parcels. These ECa values were estimated to be within 5–7\
    \ dS/m. Considering\nthe above, when the ECa, at a soil depth of 30 cm, is greater\
    \ than 5 dS/m, the proposed\nIoT system recommends the use of irrigation water\
    \ only at critical stages of olive growing.\nThus, 1–2 irrigations are recommended\
    \ before and after ﬂowering—during spring (the\nirrigation water quality is usually\
    \ better)—so that ﬂowering, fruit set and shoot growth\nare promoted. In addition,\
    \ drip irrigation is recommended to be applied at less frequent\nintervals using\
    \ a higher dosage of water each time, so that salts from the previous irrigation\n\
    events are removed to the boundaries of the wetted soil and consequently the main\
    \ volume\nof water in the soil remains close to the ECw values [41,42].\n2.4.\
    \ Irrigation Strategies and Olive Fruit Fly Alarm Rules\nBased on the proposed\
    \ system and in cases of dry periods or low water availability,\na deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategy could be applied (irrigation only at critical periods of plant\ngrowth).\
    \ Thus, the crucial parameters that are incorporated for determining the amount\
    \ of\nirrigation for each parcel and deﬁning the proper irrigation strategy are\
    \ the climatic condi-\ntions, the soil parameters/soil moisture dynamics as well\
    \ as crop parameters, phenological\nstages and the water availability for each\
    \ parcel.\nIn addition, the system may send notiﬁcations to users when weather\
    \ conditions favor\nthe development of an increased population of the olive fruit\
    \ ﬂy (Bactrocera oleae), a key\npest for olive groves of Crete. Alerts are triggered\
    \ based on data from weather stations. The\nmodel followed trigger alerts when\
    \ daytime air temperature was between 15 ◦C and 26 ◦C\nand air relative humidity\
    \ was > 65% for three consecutive days. Alerts were deactivated\nwhen, even for\
    \ one day, the air temperature during the daytime increased above 32 ◦C with\n\
    a simultaneous drop in air relative humidity below 65% [43,44].\n3. Implementation\
    \ and Discussion\n3.1. Device Implementation (IoT-Based Monitoring System)\nThe\
    \ prototype service described in the previous sections was deployed in eight plots\
    \ in\ntwo regions. Speciﬁcally, during 2021 and 2022, the proposed IoT-based monitoring\
    \ system\nWater 2023, 15, 1739\n11 of 18\nfor obtaining soil moisture and meteorological\
    \ data useful in irrigation management was\ndeveloped. The system includes the\
    \ monitoring of soil moisture and atmospheric sensors,\nwith the aim of providing\
    \ information to farmers for decision-making.\nThe climate conditions of the two\
    \ studied areas were obtained by two weather stations\n(M1 and M2); one located\
    \ in each area. These stations could adequately capture the\nmeteorological conditions\
    \ in the study areas. Both provided the IoT platform with real-time\nmeteorological\
    \ parameters (rainfall, max-min-average temperature, solar radiation, wind\nspeed\
    \ and direction, air humidity, and ET, with a time interval of 10 min), informing\
    \ and\nsupporting an effective irrigation schedule and pest control warning system\
    \ for the farmers\nensuring water saving as well as olive productivity.\nA node\
    \ with a smart soil sensor was installed in each plot of olive trees to take\n\
    measurements of soil moisture, electrical conductivity and temperature in real\
    \ time placed\nat a soil depth of 30 cm. Maintaining water content in the soil\
    \ at a constant level indicates\nthat irrigation is applied at the rate of water\
    \ intake from the crop. As mentioned above,\nexperiments have found that a representative\
    \ depth to monitor soil moisture for mature\nolive trees is at 30 cm [26]. Thus,\
    \ the soil moisture sensors were installed at 30 cm soil depth\nfor each irrigated\
    \ olive grove.\nIn the literature there are studies that propose the installation\
    \ of soil moisture sensors\nat more than one soil depth. This approach has some\
    \ pros (such as better monitoring of\nthe soil proﬁle) but also several cons,\
    \ such as cost, risks of damage during ﬁeldwork, the\npractical management and\
    \ the inherent complexity of integrating data from different soil\ndepths into\
    \ a ﬁnal and clear suggestion/decision for the user [26,45]. Additionally, for\n\
    some crops such as olives, which have a relatively shallow root system and the\
    \ effective\nroot zone is usually up to 30 cm soil depth, the selection of a representative\
    \ soil depth\nfor monitoring purposes could be considered sufﬁcient [30]. It should\
    \ be noted that the\nfunctionality of soil moisture data loggers in the ﬁeld have\
    \ already been validated and\ncustomised to the farmer’s needs.\nDetailed information\
    \ about the sensor types, main characteristics (Table 2) and the\ncoordinates\
    \ of the sensors installed as well as photographic material are given below.\n\

    \ a thermistor in the center needle to\nmeasure temperature and electrical conductivity\
    \ using a stainless-steel electrode array [46].\nThe coordinates of the sensors\

    \ for Further Improvements\nConsidering that Mediterranean islands such as Crete\
    \ include signiﬁcant rural and\ntouristic areas, water strategy approaches based\
    \ on smart technological tools may ensure\nthe balanced development between cultivated\
    \ and touristic activities, especially on islands\nsuffering from water shortage.\n\
    The proposed easy-to-use IoT system can offer farmers and local authorities the\
    \ ability\nto support proper irrigation and pest control management at the parcel\
    \ scale. It is also of\nhigh importance to note that the proposed system is a\
    \ low-cost IoT solution as it is based\nWater 2023, 15, 1739\n15 of 18\non an\
    \ open-source software and the hardware on edge devices consists of widespread\n\
    economical modules. The recommendations for farmers proposed by this system can\n\
    contribute to achieving increased water-use efﬁciency. Based on the soil properties\
    \ data\nand the climatic data of a parcel/region, the IoT platform could assist\
    \ the user to identify\nthe appropriate irrigation dose.\nThe achievements of\
    \ this IoT system can be summarized to the following points: (a)\nthe reduction\
    \ of irrigation water losses by implementing modern and accurate irrigation\n\
    techniques, both for areas with high concentrations of salts in irrigation water\
    \ and for\nnon-saltwater affected areas; (b) the optimization of irrigation based\
    \ on soil properties,\ncrop type, phenological stage as well as climatic conditions;\
    \ (c) the recommendation of a\ndeﬁcit irrigation strategy which can enhance irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, especially in areas with\nlimited water availability, giving water\
    \ only during drought-sensitive crop stages; and (d)\nsupporting alarms for pest\
    \ control using climate parameters, an extra useful service to\nthe farmers, ensuring\
    \ their crop productivity. These decision-making alarms are of high\nimportance\
    \ considering the more frequent insect outbreaks as an effect of changing weather\n\
    conditions, especially in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems.\nTo ensure the functionality\
    \ and trustworthiness of the proposed IoT system, the\neight selected parcels\
    \ in eastern Crete capture a wide range of olive, Mediterranean agro-\necosystems\
    \ including the heterogeneity of climatic, soil, topography and cropping systems.\n\
    Moreover, for each studied parcel the recommended weekly irrigation dose as well\
    \ as\nthe alarms for pest control were compared with the corresponding, manually\
    \ calculated\nirrigation values (obtained by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation)\
    \ and fruit ﬂy alarms\n(obtained by the rules of favoring weather conditions),\
    \ respectively. The above comparison\nwas accomplished during the irrigation period\
    \ of 2022. These comparisons indicate that the\nirrigation dose as well as the\
    \ alarms for pest control proposed by the IoT system and the\nmanual approaches\
    \ for all the studied parcels was entirely the same. The above conﬁrms\nthe reliability\
    \ of the outputs recommended by the IoT system.\nThe limitations of the proposed\
    \ IoT system as well as actions for further improvements\ncan be considered in\
    \ the following points. So far, preliminary user testing has been comple-\nmented\
    \ by the team of the project as well as a few farmers that had practical familiarity\
    \ with\nthe proposed IoT system during project dissemination actions. The feedback\
    \ concerning\nthe usability of the system that was obtained by these actions was\
    \ fairly satisfactory. Never-\ntheless, for further improvement of user interaction\
    \ and platform usability, a systematic\nuser test should be conducted. In addition,\
    \ as future steps, the proposed decision-making\nIoT system must expand its application\
    \ to additional cropping systems including (a) more\ncrop types of the island\
    \ (for local use), or even crops from other Mediterranean countries,\n(b) different\
    \ irrigation methods and agricultural practices, (c) different soil types, as\
    \ well\nas (d) different climate zones and modelling for more pest/disease outbreaks.\
    \ Finally,\nit should be noted that during the following irrigation period another\
    \ capability of this\nmonitoring IoT system to automatically regulate irrigation\
    \ (by controlling electric valves of\nthe irrigation system) based on soil moisture\
    \ levels will be tested and incorporated; a fact\nthat can further improve the\
    \ efﬁciency of irrigation and save time and effort for the farmer.\n4. Conclusions\n\
    The Mediterranean is considered a climate change hotspot. Many Mediterranean\n\
    areas face or will face the heat of climate change more than other places in Europe,\
    \ with\nthe largest increase in temperature and reduction in rainfall. Mediterranean\
    \ agriculture,\nincluding olive cultivation, has to adapt to new challenges that\
    \ affect local water, energy and\necosystems. On the island of Crete in Greece,\
    \ agriculture is already the largest user of water.\nThe aim of this paper is\
    \ to propose an advanced and easy-to-use technological system as\nan extra component\
    \ of an already applied regenerative agriculture approach to cultivating\nolives,\
    \ protecting production and ensuring efﬁcient use of water. Speciﬁcally, this\
    \ paper\nintroduces a low-cost IoT monitoring system that has been tested in all\
    \ the different olive\ncultivation characteristics in the extended area of eastern\
    \ Crete for proper irrigation and\nWater 2023, 15, 1739\n16 of 18\npest control\
    \ management at parcel scale. The proposed system provides useful information\n\
    in areas that face issues with water availability, saltwater intrusion and pest\
    \ infestation.\nThe Implementation of the IoT-based monitoring system took place\
    \ at eight parcels in the\neastern part of Crete, where, through the proposed\
    \ system, smart irrigation and pest control\nalert approaches for every parcel\
    \ were offered to the farmers. The proposed system includes\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies incorporating soil and atmospheric monitoring sensors and\nmicrocontrollers\
    \ for transmitting information using the MQTT protocol. Data are received\nat\
    \ a portal and made accessible on the cloud where they can be observed in real-time\
    \ over\nan open-source IoT system offering the farmers services concerning proper\
    \ irrigation and\npest control. The advanced open access decision-making system\
    \ implemented in olive\nparcels offers users the capability: (a) to know the weekly\
    \ irrigation dose per tree at the\nstudied parcel, (b) to know the proper irrigation\
    \ needs in case of applied saline irrigation,\n(c) to suggest deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ in areas with low water availability as an adaptation strategy\nmeasure to climate\
    \ change, (d) to send alarm messages to the farmers concerning the danger\nof\
    \ pest infestation aiming at protecting production, and (e) to install an affordable\
    \ ﬁeld\nmonitoring system as it is based on an open-source software and the hardware\
    \ consists of\nwidespread economic modules. The above capabilities offered by\
    \ the proposed easy-to-use\nIoT system can increase farmers’ and policy makers’\
    \ awareness of optimal irrigation and\npest control management issues critical\
    \ to crop sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.N.K.; methodology,\

    Abstract This paper presents the design of a (i) soil sensing and monitoring wireless
    sensor network (S2M-WSN) that can sense and monitor farmland with distributed
    and networked motes equipped with multiple soil sensors and (ii) a prototype decision
    support system (DSS) that analyses the soil data received from S2M-WSN using statistical
    methods, stored rules and knowledge base (KB) and auto-transmits alerts on the
    mobile phones of end-users. Both S2M-WSN and the DSS are integrated through (iii)
    predefined data frame format and interface protocol. The developed system has
    been deployed both in the laboratory and real crop conditions for verification,
    validation and performance evaluation. The system is evaluated by considering
    various performance metrics such as ambiguities associated with data, data packet
    delivery rates, support delivery performance ratio, system response time, and
    resultant plant growth. The developed system empowers the end users with assistance
    in on-field decision making through relevant advisories and alerts at right time
    on their mobile phones. The authors believe that the developed system would definitely
    bridge the information gap between end-users and domain experts for sustainable
    growth of agriculture. Similar content being viewed by others Challenges in Developing

    1 Introduction Precision farming (PF) is a farm management concept that makes
    the intensive use of advance technologies and tools [1] to enhance crop production
    with reduced environmental risks and conserved natural resources [2]. This concept
    has been widely utilized to make farming more effective and informative by enabling
    enhanced decision making about what to grow and when, what is right time and right
    proportion of irrigation and fertilization etc. It also helps the farmers in evaluating
    the exact requirements of farmland to achieve optimal production and sustainable
    agricultural growth [3]. Right and relevant information about farmland or cultivated
    soil is the factual basis and the key driver of sustainable growth of agriculture.
    Since soil ecosystem is a critical resource in agriculture production system hence
    its timely assessment and accurate evaluation is very much essential for healthy
    plant growth and optimal crop yields [4]. The soil properties [5] such as soil
    temperature, soil moisture content (SMC), and pH along with on-farm environmental
    conditions like air temperature, and sunlight, if not monitored and managed properly,
    can have the adverse effects on crop yields. Usually, soil temperature, SMC and
    pH are monitored and analyzed to predict precision irrigation and fertilization
    needs whereas soil temperature, SMC and electrical conductivity (EC) are utilized
    to predict plant growth and corresponding crop yields [6, 7]. The inherent heterogeneity
    of chemical and physical properties of soil makes it a complex ecosystem. Due
    to its complexity, its evaluation, assessment and effective management is fundamentally
    a challenge for researchers’/soil scientists. The constituent elements of soil
    testing and evaluation process such as soil sample collection, transporting the
    same to a laboratory for chemical analysis, and interpretive mapping is tedious,
    time-consuming and laborious task [8]. Furthermore, inadequate capacity of soil
    testing labs (STLs) and soil technicians to entertain large-scale soil analysis,
    dearth of soil specific decision support systems (DSS) and delayed advisories/reports
    from experts have even worsened the situation [9]. Lack of information communication
    technology (ICT) means for conveying the right agro-technical inputs from agro
    experts to end users at right time is one of the major causes that widen the gap
    between end users and experts at STLs. In their endeavor to gain maximum profit,
    the farmers exploit their farmland the way they want without knowing its adverse
    effects on soil fertility and environmental risks. It is also important to mention
    that the real reason for soil fertility degradation is not farmers’ but it is
    the unavailability of relevant and timely information during the entire cropping
    cycle. The authors also believe that the development of proposed integrated WSN-DSS
    system would definitely bridge the information gap between the experts and end
    users. The spatiotemporal study of farmland [10, 11] requires continuous sensing
    and monitoring which is very hard to realize in remote, harsh farming conditions.
    But the advances and intensive research in WSN technology has shown its potential
    in a wide variety of agricultural applications [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]
    such as precision irrigation, integrated pest management (IPM) and many more.
    Round the clock monitoring of farmland and underlying on-farm environmental conditions
    [30] will definitely ensure optimum yields and reduced potential production risks
    [31]. The WSNs consists of wirelessly networked small sized, low cost, low power,
    autonomous, and cooperating devices known as motes [32, 33]. Nowadays, the motes
    are generally equipped with a variety of application-specific sensors from simple
    e.g. temperature, humidity, light, moisture to complex sensors such as global
    positioning system (GPS), and video camera [34] and so on. These networked motes
    when deployed unattended at remotely located farms, connect the agricultural environment
    wirelessly with the computational world by providing accurate, and up to-date
    information about a number of agricultural entities in the farm environment. In
    recent times, the technological revolution in WSN technology has raised its potential
    to sense, monitor, and collect farmland information to many folds but the necessity
    to accelerate the processing of information into decisions has also increased
    at the same rate [35]. The value of information increases when data collection,
    processing, analysis and management actions are fully integrated [36]. The characteristic
    of futuristic PF systems would be real-time conversion of collected and monitored
    information into decisions. The futuristic PF systems would consist of sensor
    based monitoring systems that collect, preprocess and communicate the formatted
    farm information to remotely located data center via state of art wireless communication
    technologies where the captured and stored information is analyzed using data
    analytics before mapping into decisions. The futuristic systems would provide
    an easy to handle control to operators/managers for decision override or confirmation
    using their own experience/domain knowledge. In short, the futuristic PF systems
    would be a single package for integrated and automated sensing, processing and
    delivery of information into decisions in form of expert knowledge driven alerts
    and advisories to stakeholders at right time. To meet the futuristic PF needs,
    this paper presents the design and development of an integrated S2M-WSN-DSS system
    to assist the farmers in decision making on crop specific farmland assessment.
    The design process is divided into phases as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Design
    and development phases Full size table The paper is divided into nine sections
    where Sect. 2 discusses the research objectives and expected outcome. Section
    3 gives a brief overview of proposed system and its architecture. The Sect. 4
    consists of system design and development which provides detailed discussion on
    component level design and development of proposed S2M-WSN and prototype DSS.
    It also includes the data frame format and design of interface protocol for seamless
    data integration between S2M-WSN and prototype DSS. The Sect. 5 provides DSS prototype
    implementation. The Sect. 6 discusses handling uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness
    in real time data from WSN. The Sect. 7 describes system validation mythology
    and performance evaluation metrics. The discussion on the performance of the proposed
    integrated system based on pre-defined performance metrics and deployment in real
    crop conditions is presented in Sect. 8. The section also covers the results obtained
    during the entire verification and validation phase. In last Sect. 9 gives concludes
    the paper with future scope of work. 2 Research objectives and expected outcome
    The utmost goal of this research work is to design, develop and deploy a prototype
    integrated S2M-WSN-DSS for farmland assessment and assistance/support to decision
    makers’ in on field decision making via right and timely advisories/alerts. The
    objectives and expected outcome of the research work is given in following subsections.
    2.1 Research objectives (a) Designing WSN for sensing the farmland and on-farm
    environmental conditions in the entire cropping cycle. (b) Designing an optimal

    time. (c) Communicate timely alerts/advisories on mobile phones. 3 System overview
    and architecture Figure 1 depicts the overall architecture of integrated S2M-WSN-DSS
    system for farmland monitoring and assessment. Fig. 1 Integrated S2M-WSN and DSS
    system for farmland assessment Full size image The first component of proposed
    integrated system consists of a S2M-WSN. The S2M-WSN is deployed in form of clusters
    where each cluster consists of 05 motes and each mote is equipped with 05 sensors
    having 03 soil sensors [pH, soil moisture content (SMC), soil temperature] and
    02 environmental sensors (air temperature, sun light). In the S2M-WSN, the networked
    and distributed motes operates together to sense, monitor, collect, and transmit,
    valid and preprocessed soil information to their respective cluster head (CH)
    at an interval of 15 min over ZigBee technology. The CHs further reports the aggregated
    information to its reporting base-station (BS) using ZigBee technology. BS receives
    and processes the data packets from its cluster heads (CHs) and converts the preprocessed
    information into the predefined data frame format before communicating it to remotely
    located DSS over GSM technology. In smaller deployments, CHs can play the role
    of BS and can transmit the formatted data frames to data analytic center. The
    second component of proposed integrated system is a data-driven prototype DSS
    with inbuilt alerts and advisory features. The DSS seamlessly integrates with
    the BS of S2M-WSN through GSM technology via a serially connected GSM module (SIM
    900). The inbuilt user and configuration management module on web based graphical
    user interface (GUI) of prototype DSS empowers the authentic and registered user
    to configure the serial port details (port number, baud rate, parity, stop bit
    and data bits) to ensure the readiness of DSS application to receive any data
    on the serial port. The application after initialization, exchanges its health
    with BS of S2M-WSN with ‘ALIVE’ data packet which is acknowledged by BS application
    with ‘ACK’. On reception of ‘ACK’ the DSS application forwards a data request
    (REQ) packet at a pre-defined periodicity to BS which in response gives the data
    packet (DATA) to DSS. The received data packet is first authenticated using unique
    identification no assigned to S2M-WSN during configuration, followed by validation,
    and cleaning by the data preprocessing routine of DSS before storing the data
    attributes and values into a central database (DB). The data analytic engine (DAE)
    inbuilt in the DSS analyzes the data retrieved from the database using statistical
    techniques and knowledge stored in the knowledge base (KB). During analysis, the
    normalized value of each parameter is compared with the threshold pre-stored in
    KB. The advisories/feedbacks are generated by DSS based on the comparison of data
    analysis results. The feedback/alerts/advisories generated by prototype DSS are
    communicated on the registered mobile phones of the end users/farmers via existing
    cellular network. 4 System design and development The proposed integrated system
    is designed by considering the farmland management problems in a holistic manner
    so that overall management solutions are provided through (a) automation in data
    sensing, collection and pre-processing for integration; (b) utilization of new
    generation statistical models that are validated and best fit solution for given
    problem [37]; (c) providing a user-friendly interface and relevant and right information
    in easy-to-understand information; (d) to enable continuous updating and flexible
    access and; (e) providing information from a remote source to the end-user in
    form of alerts and advisories. The proposed system is designed not to replace
    the decision maker but assisting decision-making. It is designed, developed and
    tested by taking feedback from potential users. The next sub-section shall discuss
    the process adopted for design and development of the proposed system. An incremental
    or agile development model has been adopted for complete system software development
    [38]. This model has been adopted in the development process as it involves continuous
    interaction between users, developers, domain experts and testers in the entire
    development process. Another reason for its adoption is the consideration of the
    requirement of end-user participation in development process. In this model, the
    software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. The results in small incremental
    releases with each release building on previous functionality. Each release is
    thoroughly tested to ensure software quality. The only constraint of this approach
    i.e. maintenance of documentation is also overcome by keeping all the documentation
    intact and available during each phase of design and development. The following
    Fig. 2 self-explains the development model utilized in proposed system development.
    Fig. 2 S2M-WSN-DSS system-software development model Full size image 4.1 Designing
    S2M-WSN 4.1.1 Selection of soil sensors While designing soil sensing mote, selection
    of soil sensors is a tedious and time consuming task as it involves different
    quality metrics such as sensitivity, accuracy, stability, sensing range, durability
    and cost. In order to meet the requirement of current research work, various soil
    sensors (Fig. 3) such as soil temperature probe (PT100), soil moisture probe (VH400),
    soil pH electrode (gel filled electrode-PH-BTA), electrical conductivity (EC)
    using MT-114, air temperature integrated circuit (IC) (LM35) and light sensor
    (GL55 series LDR) were identified and selected to measure soil temperature, moisture,
    pH, air temperature and on-farm sunlight respectively. The detailed specifications
    of these sensors are given in Table 2. Fig. 3 Soil sensors deployed in real conditions

    Full size table 4.1.2 Designing configurable wireless sensor node cum cluster
    head (CH) A multi-functional, multi communication-interface and multi-application
    (M3SS) mote [44] was utilized to form the ZigBee/GSM based S2M-WSN for the soil
    property sensing and monitoring. The M3SS mote senses the multiple soil parameters
    of farmland simultaneously, filters the erroneous data, develops formatted data
    frame and routes the formatted information to networked M3SS motes at higher echelons
    configured as either CHs or BS. Figure 4 displays the building blocks of the M3SS
    mote. Fig. 4 ZigBee based wireless soil sensing (M3SS) mote Full size image The
    architecture of M3SS node comprises of five basic modules including data acquisition
    unit (DAU), data processing unit (DPU), power management module, real-time clock
    (RTC) module and wireless communication module that supports Bluetooth/ZigBee
    and GSM technologies. To provide excitations to all the sensors, the sensors need
    to be interfaced with DAU of M3SS. The DAU circuit and its PCB have been designed
    with design spark tool [45]. The sensors on excitation give low-level analog output
    which needs further amplification and calibration. In order to design the amplification
    circuitry, low noise amplifier IC TL072 has been utilized. The amplified output
    is transmitted to the inbuilt analog to digital converters (ADC) of DPU. The DPU
    of M3SS is designed with low cost, low power, small size mbed NXP LPC11U24 microcontroller
    which is especially designed for prototyping low cost and low power applications.
    The microcontroller is built with a 32-bit ARM 7 Cortex-M0 core running at 48
    MHz with 32 KB FLASH, 8 KB RAM and various external interfaces USB, SPI, I2C,
    ADC, and other I/O interfaces. This microcontroller plays a vital role as it provides
    computing power for local decision making and data aggregation, energy management
    through sleep/awake modes etc. [46]. Figure 5 depicts the designed M3SS mote utilized
    in development of S2M-WSN. Fig. 5 Designed ZigBee based wireless soil sensing
    node Full size image Due to its reliability connectivity over short distances,
    ZigBee wireless technology has been chosen for intra-network data routing in S2M-WSN.
    Furthermore, the configurable feature of this technology allows it to work in
    three different device configurations in the network such as coordinator, router,
    and end device. The ZigBee can automatically initiate, maintain and manage the
    information in the network when configured as coordinator device. It links the
    network devices together by transmitting the data and associating with other routers
    and end-devices when acts as a router device. The end device nodes can only send
    and receive the data. The coordinator, router, and end devices are similar in
    hardware but different in terms of inbuilt embedded software. Each function can
    be realized through the software configuration inbuilt in M3SS node. The M3SS
    node can also be configured as CH whose role is to receive and aggregates the
    data frames from associated networked sensor nodes reporting to it and routes
    the aggregated data frames to BS. In S2M-WSN, the CH is a solar-powered M3SS mote
    in which ZigBee is configured as a router. The CH acts as a data integrator cum
    router between sensors and BS. The inbuilt routine in CH receives the data from
    sensing nodes, cleans and validates it, assigns a unique number to the data packet
    and routes the formatted data packet to next level via ZigBee interface. This
    unique number signifies the single intermediate data packet from multiple sensing
    nodes under it. 4.1.3 Designing base station (BS) node The role of base station
    (BS) node is to receive the data from multiple CHs. The BS acts as a gateway to
    S2M-WSN. It aggregates the acquired data from CHs using aggregation algorithms,
    formats in a predefined data frame format and transmits it to distantly located
    DSS over GSM technology. It also integrates S2M-WSN with external system such
    as data analysis nodes, web servers or intelligent information systems such as
    intelligent DSSs. Figure 6 displays the components of base station (BS) node.
    Fig. 6 Building blocks of ZigBee based base station node Full size image The Fig.
    7 depicts the designed BS. The BS also acts as a network manager which manages
    the complete network based on the commands sent by the DSS. The inbuilt aggregation
    algorithm is based on averaging the time stamped values of captured data. The
    BS transmits the data based on PUSH approach where the aggregated data is communicated
    to DSS as a response of request received from the DSS itself. The data request
    can be either automated and periodic or manual request initiated by data analyst
    or expert. Fig. 7 Designed and deployed ZigBee-GSM based base station Full size
    image The BS is connected with a host computer or data analysis center or automated
    DSS through global system for mobile (GSM) module by serial RS-232 interface to
    communicate with a remotely located data analytics/decision support system. The
    base station was implemented by using raspberry pi system on chip (SoC) and its
    02 USB ports have been used to connect GSM and ZigBee modules to interact with
    CHs of S2M-WSN and DSS. It also acts as a data logger where a light weight MySQL
    database is designed and developed for data logging. 4.1.4 Power supply unit To
    understand the power requirement of the designed soil sensing node, lab experiments
    were conducted to measure the power consumption using sample data packet transmission
    at a predefined rate which is taken as one data packet/15 min an hour. Each node’s
    power consumption and duration of operation with error-free/lossless transmission
    and reception of data packets was measured in the laboratory environment. A 12
    V 6.5 Ah lead-acid heavy-duty battery is selected after analyzing power requirements
    considering (a) guaranteed and prolonged day/night (24 × 7) operation of WSN and
    (b) to reserve power for more nodes in case of network expansion. A 50 W/cm2 rating
    solar panel was selected to provide enough peak voltage to the 12 V battery during
    charging. The various components of the node were supported through a 3.3 V 1
    A regulator. 4.1.5 Network topology in S2M-WSN In order to meet the energy needs
    in application-specific environments, the WSNs have to be deployed in the certain
    network topology. The different network properties such as lifetime, throughput,
    and end to end delay are majorly affected by network topology. In this research
    work, tree topology has been used where the network utilizes a central hub that
    is also termed as base-station or coordinator node to act as a root node. A two-hop
    networking cluster with star-topology allows direct communication between the
    central node and each sensor node inside one cluster without complex routing and
    routing table maintenance. This type of topology makes the network more flexible
    and scalable as more number of sensor nodes or motes can be added into one cluster
    without reconstructing the routing table, any other new cluster can be deployed
    adjacent to others without disturbing the operation of other clusters. Another
    advantage is robustness of network as failure of any node won’t affect the operation
    of whole network. In the hieratical structure, the relay node is one level below
    from the root node. This lower level forms a star network where the sensing nodes
    reports to the relay node. The tree network can be considered a hybrid of both
    the star and peer to peer networking topologies as shown in Fig. 9. The data path
    in the network may be single hop or multi hop through which the sensed data is
    forwarded to its parent node. It is important to find an optimal shortest path
    tree with maximum lifetime and shorter delay but slightly high time complexity.
    This topology is more suitable for distributed implementation. As the target application
    is agricultural soil sensing and monitoring through a distributed WSN that is
    why this topology is chosen. Establishment of reliable communication link is important
    aspect of this topology as if there is a link break in the network path on the
    active route then communication also breaks. As per the Fig. 8, SN and SK are
    the Nth and Kth set of sensing motes which gives the data packets P i and P k
    respectively from ith and kth CHs that takes the average of each sensed value,
    forms a new preprocessed packet P i and P k respectively with unique data packet
    number. Fig. 8 Network topology in S2M-WSN Full size image 4.2 Prototype DSS overview
    and architecture The various components and architecture of DSS are shown in Fig.
    9. The main components of DSS are (1) External system interface (ESI), (2) Human
    computer interface (HCI), (3) Data processing engine (DPE), (4) Data base (DB),
    (5) Knowledge base (KB) and (6) Decision analytics & advisory engine (DA2E). Fig.
    9 DSS components and architecture Full size image 4.3 Design of prototype DSS
    for farmland assessment Designing DSS is a complex process that includes the usage
    of adequate mechanisms to model the decision process. The design and development
    of a DSS basically comprises of following. 4.3.1 Requirement capturing and objective
    identification The requirements are captured by interaction with users to understand
    their needs and expectations. The objectives of designing the proposed system
    are identified based on the interaction with the end-users who are farmers’ in
    this case. The major requirements raised by them are: (i) Lack of understanding
    of soil ecosystem of their farmland. (ii) Shortage of automated means for farmland
    assessment. (iii) Lack of means for real-time quantification of spatial and temporal
    variability of soil during cropping cycle. (iv) No means of direct feedback/response
    between farmers and experts. (v) Insufficient, unreliable and delayed response.
    (vi) Limited usage of ICT in decision making. After requirement gathering, requirement
    when analyzed, it is concluded it is not farmers’ who are generally made responsible
    for loss of fertility and lower yields and for soil degradation, it is lack of
    usage of ICT and dearth of DSSs that support decision making for soil quality
    assessment. 4.3.2 Identification of functional and interface requirements In this
    step, the functional and interface requirements are studied and identified. First
    the interfaces were analyzed. The proposed DSS will have the following interfaces:
    (i) External agency and human interfaces. The external interfaces have been identified
    to cater all the design requirements of the proposed DSS. External agencies such
    as agriculture research institutes/soil evaluation and mapping centers’ are external
    systems interfaces. The evaluation and mapping centers’ were connected to DSS
    through internet via emails. Human interface such as domain experts (agro-experts/soil
    scientists/agronomists) and end-users (farmers/researchers’) are external human
    interfaces. The interfacing with humans (both experts’/farmers’) has been provided
    through both computer and mobiles/smart phones where the stakeholders can be reached
    through both SMS. Hardware interface (computer/machines/mobiles phones). Software
    interfaces. 4.3.2.1 External system interface (ESI) This interface provides means
    to integrate registered S2M-WSNs with the prototype DSS as well as users through
    their mobile phone via internet/GSM/GPRS. It facilitates the seamless data integration
    between the DSS and registered S2M-WSN entities through a predefined interface
    data frame format and data integration mechanism. This subsection gives insight
    into following: (a) Mobile Phone data Integration/interfacing in which the ESI
    of prototype DSS transmits the alerts/advisories as received from DPE to mobile
    phones/PDAs/Tablets of registered farmers/researchers’/experts via GSM/GPRS technologies.
    This interface provides means to registered users to access alerts/advisories
    can be accessed by the on their mobile phones/laptops whenever required by them.
    This interface empowers the end users with automated and easy availability of
    required and most needed information as and when required. This medium can also
    be used by end-users to register them or to register their requests/feedbacks
    and complaints. (b) Seamless Data integration with S2M-WSN: In order to integrate
    any pre-deployed S2M-WSN with any DSS, the three steps are mandatory. First, they
    must have a uniform data frame format or interface protocol between them. Second,
    there must be a defined set of rules by which the two systems communicates with
    each other. Third and final both should comply unified communication hardware
    at both end. The structure of the data frame format for data integration is given
    in Table 3. Table 3 Data frame format or interface protocol Full size table The
    second part that defines data integration mechanism is presented in the following
    self-explanatory sequence diagram (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Data interaction diagram
    between S2M-DSS Full size image To communicate data between S2M-WSN and prototype
    DSS, GSM technology has been used. Both BS of S2M-WSN and prototype DSS are connected
    via GSM modules (SIM 900) connected at serial port of BS microcontroller hardware
    and personal computer where DSS software is installed and running. The GSM AT
    commands have been used for connections management and sending/receiving the SMS.
    Sample AT Commands are “AT + CMGL” List messages, “AT + CMGR” Read message, “AT + CMGS”
    Send message. The alert/advisory engine in DSS communicates with GSM device serially
    and reads/sends the SMSs using mentioned commands executed in the engine subroutine.
    4.3.2.2 Human computer interface (HCI) A web based solution for HCI has been to
    achieve maximized accessibility. It comprises of interfaces for user authentication
    and management, system configuration to configure the user defined communication
    media to seamlessly integrate DSS with deployed S2M-WSN using pre-defined data
    frame format or interface protocol, data visualization, data analysis, advisory
    menu options. Data visualization displays the data trends, analysis methods, reports
    and results graphically. The expert/scientist can visualize data trends, user
    information (personal and farmland specific details), and user feedback/complaints
    through the GUI. The expert operator can also load the domain knowledge (scientific/mathematical)
    and useful information (user/expert information, feedback/complaints, crop specific
    soil info.) obtained through continuous user interactions and domain knowledge
    (experts’ domain and crop specific knowledge such as usage/requirement of water
    during seeding, germination period and other necessary information into the centralized
    database (DB) and knowledge base (KB) respectively with sub menu options available
    on the GUI. This interface also acts as a mean for domain experts for interaction
    with end users via text messaging/voice call. The end user can access the expert
    advisory anywhere/anytime through user friendly graphical user interface (GUI)
    via internet. Figure 11 displays the one of the web page for prototype DSS where
    the stored data can be visualized. Fig. 11 HCI of prototype DSS Full size image
    4.3.2.3 Data processing engine (DPE) Data processing engine that includes routines
    and software functions for data acquisition in fixed data frame format as per
    pre-defined interface protocol and integration, data source authentication, data
    error checking routines, data quality evaluation algorithms, feature extraction
    and data frame formatting functions. It also provides external system (S2M-WSN)
    interface via GSM using configurable serial data interface. The inbuilt software
    routine in DPE verifies the data source in terms of authenticity of data source,
    format of data packet in reference with interface protocol and release of the
    valid data for further processing. In case authenticity of data fails or data
    is received with inappropriate format, the data is rejected at this point only.
    This routine is also responsible for verification of data quality in terms of
    valid ranges of the data received. For out of ranges data values the error is
    generated and stored in the database (DB) for viewing and display for the expert
    and further processing. Once the data values are received in valid range then
    the desired parameters are extracted from the received data and converted into
    the defined form that can be stored in the DB for further processing and calculation.
    4.3.2.4 Data base (DB) Data base stores the real data as received from the S2M-WSN.
    It also stores the user information, field information (location, crop information
    and applied supplements’) and analytics results and corresponding advisories.
    The DB also stores the crop specific soil suitability information, and other scientific
    and empirical details. The DB is a relational data base is implemented in MySQL.
    In designed DB, WSN identification number is taken as a unique key. The “phpMyadmin”
    tool has been utilized for creating various DB tables. The DB in prototype DSS
    development is named as “myagrisense” which has got interlinked tables for user
    management, data visualization, analysis, advisories and so on. One of the tables,
    the table that stores the incoming data is named as “soil_param_monitored” is
    depicted in Fig. 12. The elements of this table are WSN ID, reading no, soil pH,
    soil moisture, soil EC, soil temperature, air temperature, date and time. Another
    table having advisory details is also depicted in Fig. 13. Fig. 12 Database table
    “soil_param_monitored” Full size image Fig. 13 Database table “advisory” Full
    size image 4.3.2.5 Knowledge base (KB) Knowledge base is architecturally equivalent
    to DB as it stores the relevant information similar to DB but functionally it
    is different from DB as it stores facts about the parameters under observation,
    their thresholds, and other critical information from experts, empirical and statistical
    model information etc. It also stores relevant information about physical, biological
    and other properties important for assessment and evaluation of soils. The KB
    is filled by knowledge engineer through DSS GUI using the domain expert knowledge
    and user experiences. The information from users is gained through personal interactions/seminars/on-field
    visits/surveys/feedback collection mechanisms. The seasonal and crop specific
    needs, geographical and regional information, field specific problems, problems
    faced, are collected from the end users/stakeholders. The acquired knowledge data
    is then coded into a representation scheme to store in KB. The valid knowledge
    can be used in a knowledge-based system to solve new problems via machine inference
    and to explain the generated recommendation. In the given research work, tomato
    crop has been used as a target crop for performance evaluation of the system,
    therefore the KB must contain the necessary information to be considered as inputs
    for KB. Tomato is a warm season crop, it requires warm and cool climate. The plants
    cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also light intensity affects pigmentation,
    fruit color, fruit set. The plant is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions.
    It requires different climatic range for seed germination, seedling growth, flower
    and fruit set, and fruit quality. The requirements of soil and environmental parameters
    to be considered as knowledge for tomato cultivation are as given in Table 4.
    Table 4 Farmland soil KB for different stages of tomato cultivation [47,48,49,50]
    Full size table The requirement of soil temperature needed to be stored in KB
    prior to tomato cultivation is given in Table 5. Table 5 Soil temperature KB for
    different stages of tomato cultivation [47] Full size table 4.3.2.6 Data analytic
    and advisory engine (DA2E) Decision analytic and advisory engine (DA2E) that is
    composed of: (a) Data integrator is software sub routine that integrates incoming
    data between the DPE and alert/advisory engine (DAE) and vice versa. (b) Rule
    Engine queries the pre-loaded rules from the DB and applies on the real-time in
    the database for deeper and detailed analysis. In decision theory, a decision
    rule is a function that maps an observation to an appropriate action. The simple
    expressions in form of an {IF: THEN} expression, (e.g. {IF ‘condition’ THEN ‘result’}
    has been taken as rules. The designed rules are only applicable when its condition
    is satisfied. The evaluation of the rules is directly dependent upon the quality
    of service measures for target application and expected outcome. The proposed
    prototype DSS is intended to provide decision support on farmland assessment and
    crop specific suitability, therefore the rules in proposed system are designed
    based on consultation with domain experts (soil scientists/agronomists’) and end-users.
    The domain expert can edit/delete/add the rules through rule editor in built in
    the prototype DSS. For the target tomato crop, Table 6 depicts rules and associated
    inferences and supporting decisions. Table 6 Rules, inferences and decisions Full
    size table (c) Inference engine draws inference based on the interaction of input
    data and the rule base. It also decides which rules are satisfied by the facts,
    prioritizes them, and executes the rule with the highest priority. It operates
    in cycles, executing a group of tasks until certain criteria causes that halt
    the execution. (d) Statistical analysis engine (SAE) includes software application
    protocol interfaces (APIs) for various statistical operations such as mean, median,
    mode, standard deviation, normalized value, regression analysis and many more.
    The inbuilt APIs can be directly called by the DAE and other consumers through
    SAE. Data analytic engine (DAE) is responsible for analysis of retrieved data
    from the DB by using statistical mechanisms, stored rules and KB. The DAE applies
    the said mechanisms on the valid data. The detailed analysis includes validating
    the normalized values of the stored data for particular day/s or months with the
    pre-stored threshold as part of rules and knowledge base. The normalized sensor
    output Ni given by: $${\text{N}}_{\text{i}} = \frac{{ |{\text{S}}_{\text{i}} -
    {{\mu }}_{\text{i}} |}}{{{{\sigma }}_{\text{i}} {{\tau }}_{\text{i}} }}$$ where
    Si is the current measurement of parameters i\(\epsilon\){soilpH, soilTemp, soilMoist,
    airTemp, sunLight} and µi, σi are the mean and standard deviation over a moving
    time window ω and τi is a sensor based parameter associated with measurement accuracy
    of each ith parameter. To filter baseline (i.e. mean) fluctuations normalized
    sensor outputs Ni have been used. A trigger event (alarm) is activated when normalized
    sensor outputs exhibit sudden and significant changes, given that these changes
    are bounded within the threshold values as per predefined rules. The data analytical
    model is presented in Fig. 14. Fig. 14 Data analysis model utilized in DSS Full
    size image (e) Alerts/advisory engine (A2E) is integral part of proposed DSS.
    It not only accepts the decisions data as generated by the DAE but also map it
    into valid recommendations/advisories/alerts. The decision data is filtered into
    advisories and alerts based on severity of information. It also communicates the
    generated alerts/advisories to data integrator module. As a result of data analysis
    A2E generates advisories and alerts that are automatically sent to registered
    field users on their mobile number in terms of SMS or e-mail. For example if the
    results shows “Extreme deficiency of magnesium in soil” then an alert with “Sprinkle
    dolomite or epsom salt on the soil from time to time, or add a little epsom salt
    to the water at time of irrigation” will automatically sent to end user via SMS.
    For sending of SMS the DSS is interfaced with GSM module via serial port interface
    and software routing is one of the sub modules of main software. (f) Display engine
    (DE) manages the web user interface of proposed DSS. It acts as a manager which
    provides smooth access to users of proposed DSS. It manages functionalities on
    web GUI similar to mobile interface which can be accessed by users via internet.
    5 DSS prototype implementation The proposed DSS can run on a desktop personal
    computer (PC)/laptop with network and serial/USB interfaces. The hardware of proposed
    DSS would include a PC/laptop with WINDOWS 7 or higher version operating system.
    The required specification of the personal computer is 2.70 GHz, 2 GB RAM or more,
    500 GB HDD or more. As DSS is expected to be the repository, user access and information
    processor for all the inbuilt functions. Therefore the speed of CPU and storage
    capacity is of prime interest during selection of hardware configuration. Basically,
    the DSS software includes operating system, web server, and relational database
    management system and web applications. An open-source WAMP [51] software package
    has been installed to use its principle components. WAMP software package contains
    Windows based Apache, MySQL and, PHP language support and it has been widely used
    for development of web server solutions. It also comes with PHPMyAdmin tool to
    easily manage the relational database designed in MySQL. With WAMP, online/offline
    access can be given to everyone or only as local host. The backend application
    for communication media interfacing and data integration has been written in Python
    language. 6 Handling uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness in real time data
    from WSN The accuracy of any decision or predictions generated by any DSS mainly
    depends upon the reliability of the input sensory information. The uncertainty
    associated with input data not only hampers the appropriate operations of the
    mentioned DSSs, but also affects accuracy of decisions and prediction. The uncertainties
    may be due to the incompleteness, ignorance, vagueness, imprecision and ambiguity
    in sensor data. Therefore, it needs to be filtered before feeding a system to
    increase its reliability in making decisions or predictions. Filtering of mentioned
    uncertainties would increase the reliability and the accuracy of the integrated
    S2M-WSN-DSS. There exist a number of methods to handle uncertainty in data such
    as probabilistic methods (objective, experimental, subjective) and heuristic methods
    include certainty factors and fuzzy logic. In the proposed research work, soil
    dataset captured from S2M-WSN usually contains records of farmland environment
    and soil data. It includes a set of information that could reveal new insights
    which would definitely help in efficient classification and assessment of farmland
    soil. A fuzzy-rough based classification approach will be used to handle incomplete
    and inconsistent data [52,53,54]. An ensemble of rule based fuzzy-rough classifier
    shall be built for analyzing captured and stored soil datasets and to handle ambiguity
    and vagueness [55]. Fuzzy set theory has already proven its potential to solve
    uncertainty in data whereas rough set is a new approximation of a crisp set that
    deals with uncertainty in data by using approximation. Uncertain data in a given
    soil data set would be handled by indiscernibility for rough sets and vagueness
    for fuzzy sets [56]. Fuzzy and rough sets are well known for analyzing different
    aspects of uncertainty therefore combination of these techniques will help in
    building a robust mathematical approach for combating the problems of uncertainty.
    7 System deployment and evaluation This section shall discuss the methodology
    adapted for system deployment and performance evaluation. The system validation
    is done through experimentation both in laboratory and real field conditions.
    The WSN system’s performance was evaluated through various performance metrics
    such as soil property measurements, data packet delivery and valid data packet
    delivery rates whereas the DSS is evaluated using response delivery time and system
    response time. Furthermore, the performance was evaluated in real crop conditions.
    The detailed description of system validation and system performance evaluation
    is described in the following subsections. 7.1 System verification 7.1.1 Verification
    in laboratory environment Before deploying a system in real conditions, the foremost
    need is to test all the system components both hardware and software, in test
    laboratory environment. Figure 15 depicts the experimental setup in laboratory.
    The main purpose of testing the system prior to deployment is to verify the behavior
    of system in terms of sensing, collection of sensed information, calibration,
    power consumption, data processing rate followed by data transmission. A systematic
    experimental setup was prepared at embedded Lab of university (latitude 28.6677422,
    longitude 77.22820120000006). Fig. 15 Setup for laboratory experimentation Full
    size image First of all sensor inputs/output circuitry and connections were verified
    and tested. In order to simulate actual field conditions, soil samples were collected
    from three different and distantly located locations in northern India. The three
    soil parameters’ (pH, moisture and temperature) were measured and recorded for
    2 weeks at laboratory room temperature and illumination conditions. The data recording
    was done through standard mobile application as shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 16 Data
    monitored in laboratory experimentation Full size image To validate the recorded
    data values, the same samples were also tested at regular intervals with standard
    soil testing kit using traditional chemical based methods in the same laboratory.
    The similar kits have been widely used in soil and water analysis centers in India.
    The parameter values recorded from both the experiments were compared and a slight
    variation in values had been observed. To minimize the differential variations
    the sensing nodes were manually calibrated by varying the on mote calibration
    resistor. Once the motes are fully calibrated, a set of experiments were then
    conducted to observe the coverage behavior using Omni-directional antennas of
    3 and 15 dBi gain, respectively. Based on coverage tests, verification and validation
    of proposed system was done on the basis of reliability in packet delivery from
    WSN to DSS, battery consumption and validation of alerts generated based on breach
    of predefined thresholds. 7.1.2 Verification in real field environment Based on
    successful validation of integrated WSN-DSS in the laboratory environment, the
    next phase begins with the validation of proposed system in real field conditions.
    The real experimentation was executed with deployment of a small WSN formed with
    five M3SS nodes and a cluster head (Fig. 17) in paddy fields at one of the Krishi
    Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Andhra Pradesh (AP) in the month of June and July 2016.
    The KVKs are agriculture research institutes in different parts of country under
    Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), Govt. of India. The data sensed
    by the deployed WSN was captured by a prototype DSS deployed at embedded lab of
    university via existing GSM based cellular network The DSS supports data logging,
    analysis, decision making and alert generation on registered mobile phones. Fig.
    17 Deployments in real field environment Full size image 7.2 System validation
    and performance evaluation The performance of system is evaluated based on the
    plant growth and yields due to controlled and integrated sensing, monitoring and
    decision support through S2M-WSN-DSS. The experimental tests were conducted to
    construct controlled field conditions based on the feedback and alerts/advisories
    generated by the system. The field conditions have been controlled manually through
    irrigation management and controlled supplement application for the controlled
    conditions of soil temperature, moisture and Ph. The detailed evaluation process
    shall be discussed in next subsections. The first subsection shall discuss the
    growth requirements of selected target crop i.e. tomato followed by field evaluation
    process. 7.2.1 Crop selection Tomato crop was chosen for monitoring and subsequent
    decision support. The tomato is a warm season crop and it requires a warm and
    sunny weather for proper ripening, color and yields. It grows well in sandy loam
    soil with a well-drained clay sub. The sandy soil warms up faster and better drained
    because of which tomato grows well in it. Its growth does not suit the places
    of higher rainfall. The clay loam types of soils have higher water holding capacity
    and provide higher yields but it is more susceptible to root diseases. Therefore
    light soils are good for early variety while clay loan or silt loam soils are
    well suited for heavy yield (Late variety). Tomatoes grow best in soil that is
    just slightly acidic with a pH level at about 5.5–6.8. The pH of soil varies with
    soil temperature and moisture which is mainly affected by the seasonal conditions
    for example in summers, the soil temperature becomes close or becomes greater
    than the air temperature i.e. in months of June–August. The optimum temperature
    for tomato seed germination and its cultivation is 26–32 °C and 15–27 °C, respectively.
    At higher temperature its blossoms drops off. The damages are great when high
    temp is combined with dry wind. It will result in the failure of fruit set due
    to drying of stigmatic liquid. The red color of tomatoes is due the “lycopene”
    pigment which requires 18–32 °C for its optimum production whereas the production
    of this pigment drops off rapidly above 30 °C and reaches ‘nil’ above 40 °C. 7.2.2
    Validation in real crop field environment To validate the performance of S2M-WSN-DSS
    in real crop field environment, a botanical garden was prepared at university
    housing complex area for cultivation of tomato plants in the cropping season from
    April 2017 to July 2017. This location was chosen so that the behavior of system
    can be validated and analyzed locally. The garden was prepared to grow tomatoes
    and evenly divided into 1.5–2.0 m beds with double row on 1.5–2.0 m bed, with
    30–50 cm distance between rows having 5–6 plants/meter/bed [57]. Each mote was
    installed on edge of each bed and the soil sensors were distributed and deployed
    into the bed at predefined locations using the previous knowledge of farm soil
    variability. The cluster head (CH) were installed at the center of the test bed
    whereas the BS was deployed in the center of the field equidistant from each cluster
    head. In the deployed S2M-WSN, the three soil sensors (pH, temperature, and moisture)
    are placed at depth of 20 cm respectively from a representative dripper and at
    20 cm from the tomato plant whereas the light sensor and air temperature sensors
    were inbuilt into the M3SS mote itself. The ten nos. of M3SS motes in form of
    two clusters each having four nos. of motes, configured as sensing nodes communicate
    with each respective fourth node configured as cluster head over ZigBee. The cluster
    head preprocess and aggregates the sensed packets and transmits the aggregated
    packet to BS over ZigBee that logs and routes the formatted packet to remotely
    located DSS over GSM network. Figure 18 depicts the real crop field deployment
    of S2M-WSN in the tomato garden. The BS is installed with a support of 1.5 m height
    pole. It is also equipped with a solar panel of 30 W and 18.0 V an external battery
    with 6.5 Ah lead acidic batteries (12.0 V). Fig. 18 Deployments in real crop field
    environment Full size image To analyze the captured data, a prototype DSS similar
    to laboratory experimentation was established at university embedded lab for data
    analysis. The embedded lab is distantly located from the tomato garden. The PC
    installed with DSS software and configured with GSM module is located at the embedded
    laboratory in university. The data visualization tool inbuilt in DSS shows the
    data table with recorded data on DSS UI. The collected data from the S2M-WSN and
    alerts generated by the prototype DSS were captured at mobile application. Based
    on the data captured, the performance of the S2M-WSN is evaluated based on various
    metrics such as valid data delivery and communication reliability, battery usage,
    time taken in data uploading and alert generation and system response time. 7.2.3
    Soil data measurements The S2M-WSN system was deployed at university botanical
    garden in March 2017. Due to the varying environmental factors such as air temperature,
    sunlight, soil conditions and associated gardening activities such as irrigation,
    addition of compost and soil preparations, the locations of sensing nodes, the
    cluster head and base-station were modified and finalized in April 2017. A desktop
    computer was installed with prototype DSS software and database, was deployed
    at distantly located embedded lab and communication was established between the
    BS of S2M-WSN and prototype DSS through GSM based cellular network. Since then,
    the whole network including S2M-WSN-DSS had been running under formal operations.
    Figure 19 depicts the graphical variation of monitored and captured data acquired
    from deployed mote 3 from May 7th 2017 to July 7th 2017. The soil sensors were
    buried underground at the depth of 10 cm. The developed integrated S2M-WSN-DSS
    system was able to accomplish the desired tasks as expected. Fig. 19 Graphical
    depiction data variation/trend during observation period Full size image 7.2.4
    Performance metrics The performance of proposed integrated S2M-WSN-DSS system
    has been validated and analyzed by using a set of performance metrics which shall
    be discussed in following subsection. 7.2.4.1 Data packet delivery rates The performance
    of S2M-WSN is analyzed in terms of %age data packets transmitted by S2M-WSN and
    received by DSS. Since the communication media in between the two sub systems
    is wireless, hence it will prone to packet drops. The performance is of S2M-WSN
    analyzed in terms of both total data packets received and valid data packets received.
    Both these factors define the reliability in data communication. If Nt and \({\text{N}}_{\text{r}}\)
    defines the total no of transmitted data packets and total no of received data
    packets then data packet reception rate (η) in percentage is defined as: $${{\eta
    }} = \frac{{{\text{N}}_{r} }}{{{\text{N}}_{t} }} \times 100.$$ Due to the wireless
    propagation data packet through the network, there is always probability that
    few fields of the data packet gets corrupted or dropped or might contain invalid
    data values due to random channel behavior, link failures or signal attenuation
    due to other environmental effects. Each invalid data were deposited as “NULL”
    in data repository/database. A valid data rate (ηv) was defined as: $${{\eta }}_{\text{v}}
    = \frac{{{\text{N}}_{v} }}{{ {\text{N}}_{r} }} \times 100$$ where \({\text{N}}_{\text{r}}
    , {\text{and N}}_{\text{v}}\) is the total number of received data packet and
    total number of received valid packets at the repository of prototype DSS from
    S2M-WSN during a certain period of time. With higher Nv, ηv would be higher and
    data communication would be more reliable which lead to more reliable system.
    In practical scenario, during the data transmission, on-field plant canopy commonly
    cause radio signal attenuation. Meanwhile, competition among data upload could
    introduce logical failures. As discussed, the system performance greatly depends
    upon higher \({\text{N}}_{\text{v}}\). Therefore, in order to increase \({\text{N}}_{\text{v}}\),
    the DSS shall request the data packets from BS requesting data from specific sensing
    node in S2M-WSN whenever data is not received in stipulated time interval or in
    case of invalid data packet reception from that particular node. The request is
    made through the base station to each nth node. Each request invokes the idle
    nth node and awakes it from sleep mode so that it retransmits the latest data.
    In this manner the value of \({\text{N}}_{\text{v}}\) tends to equalize with \({\text{N}}_{\text{r}}\)
    and \({\text{N}}_{\text{t}}\) which makes the system stability better. 7.2.4.2
    Support delivery performance ratio (SDPR) The simplest and most important performance
    indicator of the designed DSS is the support delivery performance ratio. The main
    aim of agricultural DSS is to support the farmers with right decision support
    at right time. The support in terms of advisories shall be delivered in time and
    the support delivery performance must be high. It is measured in %age and defined
    through the following empirical formula $$SDPR = \frac{Actual\, Deleivered \,Support\,
    Advisories }{Total \,No \,of \,Advisory\, Generated}.$$ This SDPR measures the
    extent to which the advisories generated by the system are actually getting delivered
    to the register users as intended during a selected period (which may range from
    day to week, months) at any location of the end user. The primary utility of the
    SDPR is to identify whether the system generated advisories are getting delivered
    less or more at any location intended or not. This ratio is calculated by assuming
    the availability of cellular network services at all time. 7.2.4.3 Response time
    and throughput The system response time basically measures the total time that
    a system takes to process a request or transaction including latency. The time
    taken in processing a single request/transaction are not always represents the
    system’s typical response time. Therefore the average of response time of many
    requests is usually taken to calculate the good measure of system’s typical response
    time. The unit of response time is generally taken as “requests/second” or “transactions/second”.
    The throughput of the system is linearly related with the response time and usually
    defined as reciprocals of one another. The following formula has been used to
    determine \(T_{response}\), the response time (in s) at peak load where peak load
    is the point at which requests/transaction per minute start to decline. $$T_{response
    } = \frac{No\, of\, Concurrent\, Users\left( N \right)}{Requests\, the\, system\,
    request\, per\, second\left( R \right)} - T_{processing}$$ Here \(T_{processing
    }\) is the time taken by the system to process the transaction or request. 8 Results
    and discussion 8.1 Sensor data measurements As discussed earlier, data acquired
    from deployed node 3 from May 7th 2017 to 7th July 2017 are shown in Fig. 18.
    The designed and developed integrated system was able to accomplish the expected
    monitoring efficiently. All the variations were smoothly captured and reported
    to DSS. The performance of the designed system in terms of monitored data is depicted
    after statistical analysis. Table 7 shows the statistical soil data measured by
    the system in 3 months. Table 7 Statistical soil data measurement Full size table
    The parameters were monitored and stored in database at DSS. The week wise mean
    value of each parameter was automatically calculated and updated in the system
    for analysis. Each column of Table 3 describes week wise mean variation of measured
    values. In real deployment, the soil samples from the same location were also
    manually measured for reference duration using chemical based soil testing kit
    to check the validity of the captured data. The manually tested results are not
    shown in this paper but were equally matched with measured ones. 8.2 Data packet
    delivery rates The performance of data packet delivery is evaluated in terms of
    the packet delivery rates (η, ηv). Both the rates were calculated based on recorded
    data from May 7th 2017 to 7th July 2017. The averaged packet delivery rate (η)
    and the averaged valid packet delivery rate was found to be 93.89% and the averaged
    packet delivery rate 97.61%, respectively. The graph of both rate values (η, ηv)
    from each deployed sensor node are depicted in Figs. 20 and 21, respectively.
    Both η and ηv of sensor node 6 was extremely low as it was located at a farthest
    distance from the base station. The minimum valid data rate was 91.9% obtained
    from Node 3’s reading whereas the measurements from all the other sensor nodes
    represent valid data rates above 97%. Fig. 20 Data packet delivery rate Full size
    image Fig. 21 Valid packet delivery rate Full size image In summary, the developed
    system performed exceptionally well and satisfactorily during the field deployment.
    It has also shown advantages of network topology that enables continuous and reliable
    data collection. The overall system provides features of automated data uploading
    and logging in base station and DSS database respectively where the logged data
    was transacted over ZigBee till base station and over cellular network to DSS.
    The users of system can easily access the database through mobile phones that
    empower them with real, right and relevant information at right time when they
    needed the most. This enhances their decision making capability to many folds.
    8.3 Support delivery performance ratio (SDPR) During the entire prototyping and
    experimentation, approximately 50 nos. of times the value of soil temperature
    and moisture exceeds the threshold limit and alerts have been generated by the
    DSS. On the same time advisories with respect to generated alerts have been generated
    and communicated to the registered mobile number. Out of 50 nos. of generated
    advisories, approximately 47 messages have been successfully delivered which makes
    the SDPR of system near about 94%. The SDPR of the system is dependent upon the
    cellular service to a large extent. The loss of 6% advisories is due to the cellular
    network service. 8.4 System response time (SRT) The response time of the system
    is tested with two nos. of con current users (assumption) as only two mobile nos.
    has been registered in the system database. It is also assumed that system will
    automatically send advisories on the two mobile numbers as and when threshold
    breaches. The threshold breach is considered as one of the request. The time to
    process the data base query was measured using measurement of system time before
    and after execution of each database query. The small latency value has been manually
    added to each calculation and it was found that the response time of the system
    is near to real time and it ranges from few second to minutes depending on the
    availability of congestion free cellular network. 8.5 Impact on plant growth and
    yield In order to observe the plant growth, few plants were selected as reference
    plants in each cluster area of the garden. Then the plant height was measured
    manually on these plants three times a week and significant growth in height was
    observed during observation weeks. Further the effect of each soil parameter on
    plant height is analyzed and the variation of same is as shown in Fig. 22. Fig.
    22 Impact on plant height growth Full size image During the observation period,
    the deviations in measured parameters from optimal ranges were recorded automatically
    by the DSS. In case of threshold breach, alerts with remedial advisories has been
    automatically generated and communicated to registered farmers/end users on their
    mobile phones as shown in figure. The rule of alerts and advisories generated
    by the DSS is given in table 6. To comply the expert guidance (advisories) given
    by the system, the garden soil conditions were manually controlled by applying
    the suitable supplements/irrigation/fertilizers etc. till the optimal condition
    for tomato crop growth and disease reduction as defined in section were achieved.
    The measurements were recorded and analyzed iteratively in closed loop manner.
    The soil parameters were monitored and controlled by applying the suitable supplements
    based on the parametric variation monitored till the optimum condition suitable
    for tomato crop growth and disease reduction were achieved. The foremost requirement
    for tomato crop growth requires very stable temperature ranges with minimum temperature
    is around 10 °C and maximum being 34 °C and optimum temperatures ranges from 26
    to 29 °C. Inadequate temperature variation may result into poor fruit quality
    or reduced yields. Therefore, based on the monitored data, whenever the system
    generates alerts/alarm of ‘temperature exceeded optimal range’ the inadequate
    temperature variation was taken care by two actions via. (i) the crop field was
    covered with polycover and the plant area was converted into ‘green house’. (ii)
    to lower the soil temperature the plant area was irrigated. The user was supported
    through SMS such as higher temperature: poly cover advised and/or irrigate the
    field which assists him in taking right decisions/actions or counter measures.
    9 Conclusion and future scope of work The paper has discussed the design of both
    WSN and DSS and their integration for prototype deployment in tomato garden. The
    design of both WSN and DSS is presented with their validation in laboratory as
    well as in real conditions before actual deployment. The various issues such as
    power depletion, node ruggedness, node failure in harsh environment, failure in
    data packets and missing data values have been observed. The DSS prototype has
    been designed for experimentation purpose. The WSN coverage and deployment strategies
    for different crop, rule design, exact calculation mechanism for response time
    calculation of DSS, GUI finalization and development of rule editor shall be taken
    as a future scope of work. Currently the rules and associated advisories (text)
    has to be added for a new crop for analysis which is the limitation of system.
    The research work for handling uncertainty in real life soil data using hybrid
    approach which is combination of fuzzy and rough set and auto generation of rules
    shall be taken up in future as future scope of work. The authors believe that
    the complete design and development of whole integrated system will resolve many
    decision related issues of farmers and shall also empower them with DSS that gives
    online support based on data analysis of S2WSN data. This system will definitely
    provide a break through of many problem the end users faces during complete harvesting
    period. The system also makes farmers familiarize about use of ICT in agriculture.

    2023, 2023080451. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202308.0451.v1 Abstract The
    global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable practices
    and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play a crucial
    role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security, and minimizing
    reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy consumption associated
    with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge to achieving sustainability
    goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on transitioning greenhouses towards
    near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy consumption in greenhouses refers
    to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy usage to the greatest extent possible
    while maintaining optimal growing conditions for crops. This goal encompasses
    reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operational
    needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources to power greenhouse operations.
    This review article offers a comprehensive overview of greenhouse energy consumption,
    with the main goal of analyzing the present situation, identifying key challenges,
    exploring potential opportunities, and proposing future perspectives for decreasing
    energy usage in greenhouse environments. As the focus on sustainable agricultural
    practices grows, the need to reduce energy consumption in greenhouses becomes
    increasingly important. The review critically examines current technological models
    and strategies applied in smart greenhouse applications, as well as the monitoring
    of microclimatic conditions inside the greenhouse, encompassing factors such as
    temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover,
    it aims to present existing literature that investigates the advancement of greenhouses
    toward achieving significant reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart

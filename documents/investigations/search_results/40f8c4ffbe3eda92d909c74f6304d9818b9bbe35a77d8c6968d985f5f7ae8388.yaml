    is a key element of human life providing all the basic essentialities of life,
    technically the all four F’s: food, feed, fuel, and fiber (Spiertz & Ewert, 2009).
    Originally, the early life of human species was mainly focused on hunting animals
    in order to satisfy their food requirements, but with the passage of time, mankind
    became more aware about the domestication of plant crops along with the utilization
    of different animals for the purpose as well. These events lead to certain spells
    of rapid food productions over the time period ultimately leading to increased
    global populations. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, random new discoveries
    ranging from steam engine to electricity and digital devices created a fusion
    between the concept of surplus food and innovation which ultimately responded
    to the explosive growth in birthrates and increasing populations (Mohajan, 2019;
    Galloway & Cowling, 2002). The growing population was a concern from the early
    twentieth century; many of the famines (i.e., Irish famine, etc.) and economic
    turmoil events (i.e., the Great Depression) exposed the vulnerability of global
    efforts to satisfy the basic needs of human beings and showed how easily the inability
    to meet global food demands can become a complete disaster (Romer, 1990; Fotheringham
    et al., 2013). Lessons learnt from the tragic events of the past prompt a new
    thinking into the world, and efforts are made into a certain direction so that
    such catastrophic events are avoided and that enough food supplies can be secured
    for the world population. This all further led to the initiation of the Green
    Revolution era of the 1970s, which witnessed an immense increase in crop yield
    outputs across the globe especially among a large number of middle- and low-income
    countries, and was instrumental in improving the socioeconomic outlook for many
    countries. This revolution was mainly powered by the development of such high-yield
    cereal crop varieties along with the use of modern weed killing, pest control
    synthetic chemicals, fertilizers, and other agrochemicals (Tilman et al., 2002).
    This revolution introduced an era of stable food supplies and lesser hungers around
    the globe for a better half of the last century and in the early years of the
    twenty-first century; however, the overall impact of these approaches was not
    assessed properly and resulted in issues including runoff of harmful chemicals,
    soil degradation, and unintended negative climatic penalty (Pingali, 2012). Now,
    this in combination with the issue of resource scarcity, less availability of
    fertile and arable land, and increasing negative impact of climate changes is
    a terrible threat to global food security. Climate change and human activities
    have created some major issues for sustainable agricultural productions, such
    as higher levels of carbon dioxide, increasing global temperatures, heat waves,
    drought, and resource depletion, resulting in lower yield outputs across the world
    (Nelson et al., 2009; Gliessman, 2015). In the meantime, the UN estimates suggest
    that worldwide population will reach more than 10 billion by the middle of this
    century, and to satisfy the hunger of this immense population, an increase of
    more than 70% in production outputs is required (Prosekov & Ivanova, 2018). Securing
    food for such population is a complex issue as agricultural production systems
    need to be adjusted in accordance with the different agroclimatic zones and soil
    conditions to attain the maximum growth (Tubiello et al., 2007). The central idea
    of food security is to access healthy, nutritious food as part of daily diet regardless
    of socioeconomic boundaries, and without a sustainable approach, this would result
    in major environmental repercussions that leads to stagnant growth in food supplies
    in face of resources scarcity and global warming (Eitelberg et al., 2015). Sustainability
    in general is a broader term, and in the field of agriculture, it encompasses
    socioeconomic, ecological, and production sustainability (Smith et al., 2017).
    Such approaches focus on increasing yield intensity of crops with aim in sight
    of productions with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions so that the negative
    impact on climate can be reduced. GHG emissions tend to have a negative impact
    on food security, and therefore utilizing plant and animal systems in a sustainable
    manner for better productions and yield outcomes is crucial in lowering climatic
    risk and maintaining steady food supplies. In light of all these major challenges,
    sustainable agriculture is of great significance as it holds key to the solution
    of all these issues, to ensure global food security while maintaining balance
    among changing climate conditions, its socioeconomic impact, utilization of modern
    technologies, and sustainable productions and securing global food production.
    Role of Technology in Sustainable Agriculture The role of development and degree
    of innovation in future technologies has greatly inclined the constancy and definitely
    the productivity of agricultural products (Hutchins & Gehring, 1993). Agricultural
    technology, in the established logic, comprises the improvement and use of nutrients,
    biocontrol products, and farm machinery, but it also includes the visualization
    of genetically improved crops providing greater food quality and use of the latest
    equipment at farms that emphasize on overall sustainable production, not just
    seasonal production per hectare. With the advent of modern technologies, there
    has been an evolving trend around the globe with dramatic transformation of all
    walks of life including the field of food and agriculture (Kakkad et al., 2019).
    Surprisingly, agriculture, though being the least digitized, has seen momentum
    for the development and commercialization of agricultural technologies. The latest
    and annually growing technologies are playing a vital role in the sustainability
    of agricultural growth as a central stage. The development of new technologies
    will not only lower the burden of farming community but also help in improving
    the quality of agricultural products. Keeping in view the future challenges and
    requirements, the development and adaptation of innovative technologies have been
    considered the most important as far as food availability and security are concerned.
    With the global increase in population, climate change, global warming, and covid-19-like
    problems, it has become difficult for the growers to cope with these issues, and
    thus there is a dire need for technological revolution that overpasses all these
    challenges and move towards sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the rise of innovative
    technologies has opened up the ways for a higher productivity with good quality.
    The share in agriculture-based technology has been accelerating by more than 45%
    in a couple of years and will extend more in the near future. The latest farm
    equipment and online data collection can provide growers a better control over
    crop production, management, and quality, thus enhancing their per acre yield
    with great efficacy. Now, it is also up to the farmers that they must constantly
    acquire and adapt new technologies and pursue practices for their effective results
    to promote sustainable agriculture. Through smart technology applications, farmers
    can use accurate data for taking precise decisions, which will improve sustainability
    performance by increasing production, quality, yield per year, source use proficiency,
    and farmers’ quality of life. Digitalization of the agriculture sector allows
    it to expand production boundaries and use resources with great efficiency. Moreover,
    it also reduces many negative impacts of farming such as soil health and cuts
    costs for farmers. Here, we go through briefly about some of these emerging technologies
    that can assist farmers to attain precise data and higher yield. Wearable sensory
    technology is an alarming system that alerts farmers towards any symptoms or signs
    of disease in their livestock and helps in timely and precise treatment well before
    the infection is established. Cloud-based data management systems incorporate
    several information systems altogether that are helpful in reducing farmer labor
    and data collection and maintenance. Robotics in agriculture is one more technology
    that can be used for the transformation of farming. Some of the already adopted
    systems include automated robotic milking system, robotic feeders, and slurry
    scrapers that help in reducing the skilled manpower at farms and also improve
    the comfort for animals like cows. Laser scarecrow is the latest equipment used
    in the farm invented to keep away pests and birds like locust and blackbirds respectively
    that can otherwise destruct up to 70% of crops before and after harvest in the
    field. It produces a green laser beam up to 600 feet that is not visible to humans
    in the daylight, hence an eco-friendly and non-disturbing technique. Therefore,
    it is an important and efficient technology as far as the traditional and labor-consuming
    methods of pest control are concerned. Bee vectoring is an excited development
    in plant disease management as far as the biological control of plant pathogens
    is concerned. Going through different phases of experimentation in different countries
    worldwide, it is found to be the proven and effective integrated disease management
    strategy. This technology can use different organic compounds or naturally occurring
    beneficial microbes like fungus, used in bio-products (Vectorite), that helps
    in protecting crops against a number of pathogens like Botrytis and Sclerotinia.
    Bee is used as a vector for spreading these important biocontrol-based products
    to plants, thus a very eco-friendly and natural way of enhancing plant growth
    and disease management. Harvest quality vision (HQV) is a new technology that
    uses computerized system to detect the quantity and quality of harvested fruits
    and vegetables. This instrument includes a camera with different software for
    real-time detection and sorting/grading the produced. Moreover, this software
    also alarms when any defects or disease symptoms are found on the product and
    helps in screening for better quality. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is
    a technology that exploits radio waves to detect data labeled to an object. It
    is very much similar with barcode but has more efficiency and can work systematically
    at agricultural farms from several feet away even in dirty conditions. It can
    be reprogrammed and can also be used for tagging harvested and stored crops. Moreover,
    it also minimizes data errors through computerization and increases traceability
    and rapid reminder for management whenever needed. Vertical farming is the future
    of sustainable agriculture because of many factors like industrialization, climate
    change, and depletion of land resources and inadequate use of pesticides/chemicals.
    It is actually the next phase of in-door farming with different techniques of
    growing crops vertically in huge racks one over the other in a limited space with
    more than 70% production compared with field. This is really a method for meeting
    up the future food demands in controlled environment without getting in the climate
    change factor. Minichromosome technology is developed by the breeders as a mini
    plus in genetic engineering to have bio-fortification, the enhancement, or supplementation
    of the crop’s nutritional content. It can also be a part in improving crop resistance
    with new characters such as drought resistance. It uses a plant’s original chromosome,
    so there is no ethical issues as compared to genetically modified plants. This
    technology has wide applications and potential in agriculture, but till now it
    is not fully explored. Drone technology is one of the more efficient technology
    adopted at the agriculture farms because of its lesser time consumption with greater
    output observation and data. This technology is improving day by day as it can
    carry different cameras and sensors that are found to be very profitable in determining
    many aspects of crop condition, weeds, disease prevalence, etc. through aerial
    imaging. This all helps in developing and practicing early, precise, and targeted
    crop and disease management strategies efficiently (detailed in section Robotics
    and Drone Technologies). In spite of the availability of all these and many other
    innovative technologies, there is still a considerable gap among the science and
    practices on farm. So, everyone needs to get in for this technological transformation
    and sustainable agriculture. Digital Transformation for Sustainable Agriculture
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) Artificial intelligence
    is the imitation of making a machine intellect and programming it for impersonating
    human actions. The term AI is first devised by John McCarthy (1927–2011) also
    known as the father of AI in 2006. This opens up a new science of learning, through
    the development of software and technologies getting into each other. An AI system
    can be developed by engineering machines with computational data power capabilities
    and using them for the welfare of mankind in one way or the other. Some of the
    components of AI include machine leaning (ML), which guides a machine about implications
    and assessments depending upon the earlier practices, thus making a self-derived
    evaluation by using the input data and saving quality time and labor for humans
    (Patel et al., 2020). Deep learning (DL) is actually a technique in ML. It imparts
    machine-to-route inputs through films and translates them into some outcome. Neural
    networks work on the same principle as human neuron cells by catching a number
    of data sets and processing it just like the living brain (Kodali & Sahu, 2016;
    Kulkarni & Deshmukh, 2013). Natural language processing (NLP) uses the natural
    principle of reading, understanding, and then interpreting an output by a machine.
    Computer vision and cognitive computing use algorithms for understanding and studying
    images or speeches in a way to give better output based on observations (Pandya
    et al., 2020; Sukhadia et al., 2020). There are three major types of AI based
    on their functionalities including artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial
    general intelligence (AGI), and artificial super intelligence (ASI) using machine
    learning, machine intelligence, and machine consciousness respectively. The major
    purpose of all these types is to facilitate and ease the workload of human beings
    by developing hi-tech tools and equipment that are fully automated (Parekh et
    al., 2020; Jani et al., 2020). AI is playing a vital role in improving our daily
    lives from Google searches to agricultural farms and in giving perceptions into
    employer behavior and then recommendations based on the data. It is based on diverse
    fields including biology, linguistics, computer science, mathematics, engineering,
    and psychology (Gandhi et al., 2019; Ahir et al., 2020). Moreover, it has various
    advantages over augmented intelligence and includes all those technologies that
    made life far better and easy by lessening human error, 24 h availability, replication
    of work with secure systems, and digital output results. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) includes a group of objects that are implanted with sensing devices, software,
    and other innovative technologies that link and interchange data with other equipment
    and systems using the Internet or other communication linkages. Both AI and IoT
    are linked together to achieve higher levels of innovative and sustainable technologies
    in different industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT) increasingly become strengths of agriculture industry as well. With a hopeful
    prospect, the agricultural technology is getting up, and a recent report indicated
    that AI agriculture market will grow annually at a rate of 28% from 2019 till
    2024. Nowadays, farmers are looking towards AI and the IoT for providing all the
    latest facilities that are more efficient and sustainable. AI and the IoT have
    revolutionized the agriculture sector with the introduction of the latest technologies
    that increased the crop yield in the presence of uncertain climate change factors,
    increase in world’s population, and other food security issues (Raj et al., 2021).
    They also provided innovative solutions to the farmers for having a maximum output
    with lesser or the same input ensuring food quality. There are a number of modern
    technological applications of AI and the IoT that can be used at agriculture farms
    like irrigation, spraying, and weeding with the help of sensor-based technologies
    implanted with software. These innovative technologies can save the use of excess
    water and chemical pesticides, therefore minimizing the environmental toxicity
    and maintaining the soil fertility with good-quality food (Kim et al., 2019).
    Use of agricultural robots and drones with built-in hi-tech software and computer-based
    systems has made a great contribution in assessing and diagnosing plant data and
    pest distribution over the large field area in a short time span. These robots
    are used in sensing through GPS and Google Maps, and their data is processed through
    different wireless systems for reading (Liakos et al., 2018). With fast-growing
    technology every day, it is expected that an average farm will create a usual
    of 4.1 million data sets (Talaviya et al., 2020). Some of the various ways through
    which AI and the IoT become the best option for sustainable agriculture are as
    follows. Monitoring Crops and Climate Till now, many of the farmers are collecting
    and recording their data manually, consuming many hours, but still do not have
    the exact information due to human error. This can be solved by the prime use
    of AI- and IoT-based scientific technologies for monitoring crops and climate
    digitally (Mehta et al., 2021). Monitoring devices are of great importance while
    collecting and interpreting data from farms to the data bank. Cloud-based data
    like software as a service (SaaS) can be used with IoT platforms to collect records
    of multiple farms that can be of great value for in-time decision-making and observations
    like weather conditions, crop stage, soil quality, etc. This cloud-based data
    collection can improve farming on a large scale and even on national levels with
    greater insights and advantages. This data then can be deposited in the cloud
    to make it more systematized and manageable, thus allowing field activities to
    be monitored from anywhere and anytime. This can also be supportive for running
    an agribusiness as it helps in maintaining and rationalizing data and financial
    outputs in real time. Smart Farm Machinery From simple tractors connecting with
    AI-based devices to self-driven tractors, data collection now becomes totally
    automated and more precise. Nowadays, modern farmers especially in the developed
    countries use the latest farm tractors which are fully equipped and implemented
    with AI- and IoT-based sensors that monitor and record its operational data with
    the Differential Global Position System (DGPS) (Yahya & Ben‐Othman, 2009). Performance
    and navigation of the tractors can be detected by a combination of hardware (sensors)
    and software (online applications) which measures location, energy consumption,
    and transfer of data for real-time assessment. Therefore, self-directed farm machinery
    with sensors, stereo cameras, and DL processes are used for capturing in-depth
    images for high-level detection (Redmon et al., 2016). Some of the object detection
    models recently used for agriculture applications include LiDAR (Light Imaging,
    Detection, and Ranging) (Inoue et al., 2019), RCNN (Ren et al., 2018) and SSDs
    (Liu et al., 2016). Some self-directed tractors, rice transplanters, and threshers
    have also been developed in collaboration with AI- and IoT-specialized engineers
    using DL-built computer visualization devices that can be used efficiently, for
    instance, in case of detection of fully ripened fruits and vegetables for harvesting
    (Kim et al., 2019). Radical Irrigation Systems and Fertilizer Applications Being
    humans, we are listening to a very common proverb from years and years that “Water
    is Life,” but now it is easy to understand this proverb as billions have been
    already invested in developing technologies that are used in minimum water consumption
    especially to fulfill future agricultural requirements. Many more efficient inventions
    have been in line using AI- and IoT-based approaches for better water usage and
    management taking irrigation systems to an advanced level. A fully automated system
    providing real-time data on soil moisture, humidity, and temperature through built-in
    sensors helps in determining soil water requirements precisely. These sensors
    are linked with MQTT (messaging procedure for the IoT) which helps in observing
    the real-time data (Nawandar & Satpute, 2019). For effective energy consumption
    and water intake, controlled water pump with adjustable flow rate is also developed
    using IoT-based sensors that can be handled from anywhere using mobile or web
    applications (Al-Ali et al., 2019). Likewise water, less or excess application
    of fertilizers, and micronutrients are another problem that results in lower yield.
    Using IoT-based AI technologies like NPK sensor and fog computing, farmers can
    have access to the availability and requirement of NPK in their soils (Lavanya
    et al., 2019). Some of the smart and sustainable agriculture-based technologies
    using AI and IoT include: Smart elements: It contains a collection of equipment
    that eliminate manual data gathering by the use of server-based sensors that formulate
    and forward data to the base camp online and help in rapid and precise decision-making.
    allMETEO: It is a gateway to cope with IoT-based weather stations which collect
    immediate data and create a weather plot prediction. Pycno: It is a sensing instrument
    that collects data from the farm and transfers it to a smartphone through software
    and also contains disease models for risk assessment. Pest and Weed Control Regular
    use of traditional pest control methods and overdose of pesticides are big-time
    issues for eras, as far as soil, beneficial organisms, and environmental safety
    are concerned. Numerous approaches have been evolved for protecting crops from
    pests using the AI- and IoT-built technologies. Similarly, to manage weeds without
    damaging the major crop is time-consuming, labor requiring, and a challenging
    task; therefore, particular innovative AI-based site-specific technologies are
    developed with the combination IoT, robotics, and cutting-edge imaging methods.
    RGB and infrared (IR) imaging sensors are much used under field conditions for
    weed detection with pre-processing component that helps in resizing and altering
    of color spaces followed by separation of plants from soil and collecting only
    the weeds. To have more effective results, several algorithms like stepwise linear
    discriminant analysis (SWLDA), principal component analysis (PCA), and linear
    discriminant analysis (LDA) can be combined. Support vector machines (SVM) and
    artificial neural networks along with convolutional neural network (CNN) can be
    used for the final sorting of weeds and respective crop with ML or DL systems
    giving highly precise results (Akbarzadeh et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Therefore,
    AI- and IoT-based weed control system can be used efficiently for minimizing the
    use of herbicides and environmental hazards. Robotics and Drone Technologies The
    agriculture sector is of great importance to the world not only because of the
    rapid increasing demand for food by the ever-rising population but also due to
    the economic clout of the sector which already employs a large proportion of the
    world population and will be further crucial in maintaining steady employments
    globally (Talaviya et al., 2020). The sector is of key importance for the economic
    stability and prosperity of developed as well as developing nations and also for
    the progress of rural communities around the globe making rural progress in line
    with urban development a reality (Shah et al., 2019). All this put great emphasis
    on sustainable growth of the agriculture sector worldwide. Technological advancements
    are simply revolutionizing all walks of life, and the agriculture sector is no
    exception in this; over the last decade, digitalization has rapidly increased
    in agriculture field as integration of electronic devices and computer systems
    is transforming the sector (kakkad et al., 2019). Automation of agriculture sector
    involves knowledge and expertise from multiple fields including biology, mathematics,
    computer science, and engineering, allowing flexibility for the skilled labor
    force which was originally restricted to specific fields and now is able to work
    on resolution of certain challenges in various fields (Jha et al., 2019). The
    latest robot technology is built in a manner to collect information about certain
    problems from the field and utilize that data for resolving issues via various
    artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches. Several high-end robots powered
    by new AI-based approaches are now being utilized for dealing with numerous field
    challenges in agriculture including, crop yield assessment, quality monitoring,
    environmental factors assessment, soil content assessment, real-time image data
    processing for harvesting, and marketing. As the global population continues to
    rise, an imminent food crisis is a major threat, and AI-based robotic technological
    solutions are enabling growers to combat these issues and improve their production
    outputs on a consistent basis to ensure global food security. Automated robotic
    machine solutions are more efficient than conventional field machines and require
    less labor inputs, thus offering more efficacy; due to this, such automated machines
    are now becoming more and more integrated in day-to-day farm operations (Dursun
    & Ozden, 2011). Sustainable food productions with efficient resource utilization
    have become the motto for machine and robotics application in agriculture; this
    is crucial in the face of rising populations and ever-squeezing resources and
    is in line with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the UN. Water is the
    most important resource for sustenance of all kinds of life forms including plants;
    the agriculture sector accounts for the largest fresh water resource consumption
    in the world, and this resource is depleting consistently (Talaviya et al., 2020).
    In this regard, there is a dire need for the development of such system which
    can assist in conserving water resources along with stable growth in production
    outputs. Machines and robotics provide a solution for this in the form of modern
    irrigation systems where the entire program is designed with field robots mounted
    with sensors which assess the level of moisture, humidity, soil, and air temperature
    and estimate the amount of water needed by a plant in relation to its growth stage
    and the future weather forecast; the entire data is processed in real time, and
    machine-to-machine coordination enables a quick and effective response with least
    exploitation of resources (Kumar, 2014; Shekhar et al., 2017). Another major challenge
    for field crops is weed; the assessment for nutrients, water, and other essential
    inputs is made in a way to maximize yield outputs, but weed effects tend to disrupt
    this system as they compete with plants for space and nutrients, thus influencing
    yields. In order to resolve this issue, modern automated systems are being developed;
    these robot systems are powered by laser range fielder (LRF) for weed management;
    it consists of a gray-level vision which guides robot motion and a color-based
    vision which performs image analysis for the detection of weeds and its differentiation
    from crop plants (Fennimore et al., 2016). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or
    simply known as drones, are sort of aerial robots and are becoming increasingly
    important in the agriculture industry. These drones have a series of sensors attached
    on it and work in combination with GPS systems in order to access field health,
    crop monitoring, weed identification, and assessments. These drones systems are
    used for recording, assessment, interpretation, and predictive outputs of plants
    in the field. As these drone technologies are helpful in resource management as
    well as effective responses, they are becoming more and more popular in agriculture
    field. These drone technologies are also useful in the management of crops under
    extreme weather conditions, and for such crops which have tall growth patterns,
    like maize, sugarcane, etc., drones with attached sensors and high-spectral imaging
    cameras assess field conditions and provide a broad view of ongoing problems.
    The collected data can be further utilized for resource distribution, weed management,
    and disease containment in the field (Sugiura et al., 2005). Drones are used for
    spraying purposes in order to disperse chemical treatments over a large field
    area; these drones assess imaging data and make accurate calculations of how much
    treatment concentration is needed in a mixture. The resultant chemical mixture
    ensures lesser spill off into the environment and fewer residual effects as the
    concentrations are carefully calibrated by the drone machines (Yallappa et al.,
    2017; Nørremark & Griepentrog, 2004). Use of technology has been around since
    the dawn of the twenty-first century; with all technologies applied to enhance
    yield outputs, the introduction of drones has taken this whole operation to a
    new level. IUAVs with high-resolution cameras and infrared sensors in combination
    with GPS technology provide real-time field monitoring information; the collected
    data can be processed to study each growth stage of the crop plant and prepare
    yield maps to make predictive analysis of yield outputs. As global population
    is gradually moving towards nearly a 10 billion mark by 2050, the agriculture
    and food production sector is coming under an immense pressure (FAO et al., 2017).
    In addition to the unavailability or lesser supply of fresh water, fluctuating
    environmental temperatures, less land, and resource scarcity are some of the key
    challenges to agriculture and global food security. Resolving these challenges
    is key to the future; for this, cognitive thinking-based automated solutions and
    application of the latest technologies will be crucial in handling these issues
    and providing realistic solutions to these challenges. OMICs and Genome Editing
    Technologies Structural identification of DNA and exploring its sequence were
    a major leap forward in the era of life sciences (Collard & Mackill, 2008; Collins
    et al., 2003). These discoveries were pivotal for plant research during the twentieth
    century as it laid the foundation for molecular breeding techniques via probe
    markers. This marker-assisted approach was of great significance due to the specificity
    of genetic markers and was supportive for genetic screening efforts which enabled
    the incorporation of multiple high-value traits in a specific crop cultivar. These
    genetic approaches were further shifted to the next level by efforts focused on
    combining genetic information from multiple species in a single plant creating
    a transgenic plant which imparts specific genetic traits onto the crop, i.e.,
    creation of commercial BT cotton and HT plant cultivars (James, 2007). Now the
    modern omics technologies are further equipping the scientific community with
    better tools to resolve issues regarding food security. Reducing costs for genome
    sequencing has now made reference genomes available for multiple plants species,
    and in some cases, multiple high-quality reference genomes are available. This
    genome-wide sequencing results in the detection of key core- and pan-genome regions,
    and this sequencing power in an integration with new statistical models makes
    massive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) possible (Luo et al., 2020; Li
    & Yan, 2020). These OMICS approaches were mostly engulfed together in a single
    combined era termed as the third breeding revolution, and this information in
    combination with the latest genetic engineering tools has now initiated the fourth
    breeding revolution powered by precision breeding techniques. Transgenic approaches
    were adopted in the late 1980s followed by the first commercially available transgenic
    crops coming into scene in the 1990s. The key element of the transgenic approaches
    is the introduction of some exogenous genetic material encoding for a certain
    trait into the host plant cell ultimately enabling the production of particular
    defense-related biochemical compound. Despite the successful achievements of such
    techniques, the commercialization of transgenically enhanced crop varieties is
    often limited by lengthy and costly approval procedures, and such time-consuming
    approval procedures often render the newly established defense vulnerable (Chen
    et al., 2019; Shrivastava, 2011). With each of the traditionally used approaches
    being beneficial in one manner or the other, still each of these techniques is
    held back in their own ways, which in an ever-increasing climate changing scenario
    poses an increasing risk of food security and is essential to be dealt with. The
    introduction of the desired site-specific genomic manipulation has become a topic
    of focus since the early 2000s with the introduction of earlier gene editing techniques
    like the zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector
    nuclease (TALEN). These earlier gene manipulation technologies faced certain limitations
    including cost, difficult construction, and off-target mutations making it ineffective
    for broad-range applications (Chen et al., 2019). Clustered regularly interspaced
    short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) has become the face of modern gene editing
    approaches and is the most innovative scientific discovery of the twenty-first
    century which has brought a revolution in the scientific world. The CRISPR/CAS9
    genome editing technology has been applied to mammalian and plant cells with a
    high success rate in the early 2010s paving the way for broader application of
    the technology in plants enabling research community leveraging modern sequencing
    techniques for achieving desired traits (Li et al., 2013). In the light of recent
    evidences, effective results are achieved by the use of CRISPR/CAS9 in plants.
    The CRISPR/CAS9 works on a basic principle of cutting and denaturing the gene;
    for this purpose, CAS9 generates a simple double-strand break on the desired gene
    location which is later repaired by the natural repairing system of cell. The
    repair can either be non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or a homologous directed
    repair (HDR). In NHEJ the two broken strands are joined together causing mutations
    in the certain gene and making it imperfect. In HDR the broken strands of DNA
    are repaired by using a template strand as a reference and repairing the broken
    strand in reference to the template (Voytas, 2013). CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing
    technology is being used in plants for enhancement of various traits and to strengthen
    the sustainable agriculture approaches with less utilization of resources made
    possible by using better plants. A major threat to plants is infection resulting
    from interaction with different types of microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, fungus)
    and viruses; the resulting interactions cause diseases and other physiological
    implications ultimately making it difficult for plants to grow and reducing yield
    outputs. In order to resolve such issues, the CRISPR/CAS9-based genome editing
    has turned out to be a major approach in reducing the impact of such disease threats.
    Currently, the CRISPR genome editing technology has been successfully used for
    enhancement of resistance in plants against certain viruses and bacterial- and
    fungal-based diseases. In addition to the basic efforts focused on better immune
    response of plants, the genome editing technology is also being utilized for other
    sort of trait enhancements including such traits that focus on abiotic stress
    and yield-oriented traits. Table 10.1 gives brief information for some traits
    that have been engineered in plant using genome editing technology. The corresponding
    products produced are of great assistance for sustainable food production in face
    of climate change threat. Table 10.1 Genome-edited traits in plants Full size
    table Conclusion The rise in global food demands has led to the intensification
    of agricultural practices; this ultimately resulted in the production of food
    to satisfy the hunger of the globe. On one end, these practices secured steady
    food supplies for everyone on the planet since the last century, but on the other
    end, these practices also resulted in the exploitation of land and scarce natural
    resources. This will impart immense cost in the form of lower yield outputs for
    future generations with ever-increasing threat from climate change. In this regard,
    sustainable agricultural practices are the dire need of the time, using modern
    technologies in incorporation with the latest efforts in genetic engineering to
    produce new cultivars will help in increasing yield outputs with a minimum resource
    penalty. In addition to this, it will also be beneficial in reducing greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions that ultimately further deteriorate climatic situations and
    have negative impact on food security. Sustainable practices will help in the
    adaptability of multiple crops, reduction in GHG emissions, food security, prevention
    of environmental deterioration, and economic sustainability. References Ahir,

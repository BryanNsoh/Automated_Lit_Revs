    are presented. • Widely used sensors in agricultural deployments are surveyed.

    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\

    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\
    \ research in agricultural applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n17 of 45\nTable\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\

    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\

    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\

    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\
    \ and Spain are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, \nEcuador, Indonesia\

    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\

    \ per country. \nFigure 1. Number of published papers presenting IoT systems for\
    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\

    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\

    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\

    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the ones\
    \ that\njust oﬀer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in this\
    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\

    \ environments (air, water, soil or plant) have been\nmonitored in most papers.\
    \ This information is presented in Figure 5. A paper that monitored the soil\n\
    can measure one or more parameters, but this information is not included in Figure\

    Following, the details about the number of monitored parameters are presented\
    \ (see Figure 6).\nFrom the 89 included papers, more than half of the proposals\
    \ measure between three and four\nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\

    \ On the other hand, there are ﬁve\npapers (6% of cases) that do not measure any\
    \ parameter [33,41,77–79].\nNext, the details about the measured parameters are\
    \ shown. Regarding the sensors of soil, plants,\nand water (see Figure 7), the\
    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\
    Diﬀerent sensors are used, [84] used a sensor based on optical signals while [46]\
    \ utilized a commercial\nFC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).\n \n\

    \ measure between three and four \nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\
    \ or two) represents 31% of the cases (17% one \nparameter and 14% two parameters).\

    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one \nfor water [69]). Only four papers\
    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\
    \ wetness was \nconsidered in their system [46,84,85]. Different sensors are used,\
    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\
    \ from the soil, water, and plants in papers that propose an irrigation \nsystem.\
    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\
    \ that include in \ntheir proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless,\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\
    \ monitor the water level in the tanks\nand the most used is the one based on\
    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\

    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\

    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\

    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\

    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ be seen in Figure 26, a large percentage of the authors, more than 50%, have\
    \ not defined the \nstorage system they have used, there are 79 other papers where\
    \ the storage system used is not \nspecified.  \n \nFigure 26. Number of papers\
    \ per storage system. \nTo be able to provide the new services that are currently\
    \ demanded in IoT, it is necessary to use \nmiddleware. Through middleware, it\
    \ is possible to connect programs that initially had not been \ndeveloped to be\
    \ connected to each other. Bandyopadhyay et al. [199] presented a classification\
    \ of the \nIoT-middleware, based on the various features and interface protocol\
    \ support. One of the reasons \nwhy middleware is needed to connect IoT devices,\

    \ advantage of existing middleware using it on different cloud platforms. \nWhen\
    \ we talk about the cloud, we identify a place where data, which is collected\

    \ In most of the articles, it is \nindicated that the data is processed in the\
    \ cloud itself, and the end-users view all the information by \nconnecting to\
    \ the cloud. Cloud storage has been done on different platforms as it can be seen\
    \ in Figure \n27. In 24 of the reviewed articles, the authors specified that they\
    \ store the monitored data in the cloud, \nbut do not identify the utilized cloud\

    \ 2020, 20, 1042\n30 of 48\n7. Discussion\nIn this section, current trends regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\

    \ reviewed IoT systems for irrigation, both 3-layered [46,83,118,217,218] and\
    \ 5-\nlayered architectures [180] are available. Commonly, the lower layer is\
    \ comprised of the sensor nodes \nand the actuators. The middle layer is comprised\
    \ of a gateway and contemplates data transmission. \nLastly, the third layer is\

    \ performed a study on wireless communication among above ground and \nunderground\
    \ devices. The path loss link between above ground and underground devices reached\
    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\

    \ for the Implementation of a Smart Irrigation System for Agriculture\nIn this\
    \ subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system\
    \ for irrigation.\nIn order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture, the\narchitecture should provide interoperability,\
    \ scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.\nAfter having carried out\
    \ an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our\narchitecture\
    \ proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication,\
    \ services,\nand application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects\
    \ related to management and security\nshould be treated jointly between the communication\
    \ and services layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n36 of 48 \n \nFigure 30. Architecture\
    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\

    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\

    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    Moderate\n3.1.1. Satellite-Based Platforms\nSpace-borne platforms for remote sensing\
    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\

    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\

    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\

    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\

    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\

    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard
    [6]. Senet operates two public cloud-based networks, Managed Network Services
    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field
    mapping for precision agriculture. Research challenges in IOUT are presented in

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    1Food safety is becoming more and more serious topic worldwide. To tackle the
    food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability
    system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including
    the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting,
    warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized,

    Abstract: The advancement of technologies over years has poised Internet of Things
    (IoT) to scoop out untapped information and communication technology opportunities.
    It is anticipated that IoT will handle the gigantic network of billions of devices
    to deliver plenty of smart services to the users. Undoubtedly, this will make
    our life more resourceful but at the cost of high energy consumption and carbon
    footprint. Consequently, there is a high demand for green communication to reduce
    energy consumption, which requires optimal resource availability and controlled
    power levels. In contrast to this, IoT devices are constrained in terms of resources-memory,
    power, and computation. Low power wide area (LPWA) technology is a response to
    the need for efficient utilization of power resource, as it evinces characteristics
    such as the capability to proffer low power connectivity to a huge number of devices
    spread over wide geographical areas at low cost. Various LPWA technologies, such
    as LoRa and SigFox, exist in the market, offering a proficient solution to the
    users. However, in order to abstain the need of new infrastructure (like base
    station) that is required for proprietary technologies, a new cellular-based licensed
    technology, narrowband IoT (NBIoT), is introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. This technology
    presents a good candidature to handle LPWA market because of its characteristics
    like enhanced indoor coverage, low power consumption, latency insensitivity, and
    massive connection support towards NBIoT. This survey presents a profound view
    of IoT and NBIoT, subsuming their technical features, resource allocation, and
    energy-efficiency techniques and applications. The challenges that hinder the
    NBIoT path to success are also identified and discussed. In this paper, two novel
    energy-efficient techniques “zonal thermal pattern analysis” and energy-efficient
    adaptive health monitoring system have been proposed towards green IoT. Topic:

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction 5G is on the purview where IoT will seize
    the stage spotlight, as IoT devices would form a notable segment of the 5G network.
    The radical evolution of the current Internet into a network of interconnected
    objects harvest information from the environment and interact with the physical
    world. The mammoth interest of connecting sensors, actuators, meters cars, appliances,
    and so on with internet, results in the Internet of Things [1], [2]. According
    to IEA-4E (Electronic device and network annex), the number of network connected
    devices will be 50 billion by 2020 [3]. Thus enterprises ushers into the modern
    era of automation to evidently change our daily lives by providing solution related
    to multiple sectors of health, agriculture, retail, vehicular, industry, power
    grid, underwater, buildings, homes, environment, transportation, smart home [4].
    By 2024 itself, it is expected that the IoT industry will generate a revenue of
    USD4.3 billion [5] and it’s expected to grow over years. However, deployment of
    gigantic IoT ecosystem brings in various challenges to handle such as cost-efficient
    robust and flexible connectivity, interoperability of heterogeneous hardware,
    diverse security mechanism [6], and long battery life. However, the major deployment
    obstruction is due to constrained resources availability for IoT devices i.e.
    limited energy, limited computation, and limited processing capabilities [7].
    Most importantly the flavor of IoT gets bitter, especially due to limited energy
    as this leads to unanticipated human intervention. Hence the burning issue of
    efficient utilization of energy is getting anomalous traction from academics and
    industry. In literature, various techniques have been proposed to tackle this
    critical issue such as energy harvesting, sporadic transmission, resource allocation,
    clustering, etc. Ju and Zhang [8] suggested the technique of predictive analysis
    with energy harvesting to obsolete the battery from IoT device. Na et al. [9]
    suggested a technique to charge the device wirelessly using RF. Further, a power-aware
    connectivity using Spanning tree algorithm is suggested by Karthikeya et al. [10].
    Shafiee et al. [11] designed a circuit to manage the power of the device where
    a source of energy is ambient. Another crucial challenge is to handle the diverse
    requirement of wide range of IoT applications. Today there are two evident classes
    of IoT applications: Critical IoT and Massive IoT. Critical IoT applications such
    as autonomous driving or remote surgery require very low latency with ultra-high
    reliability. Massive IoT (M-IoT) applications like smart building, logistics,
    tracking and fleet management, smart agriculture, etc. require low cost device
    with reduced complexity that consumes low power, wide coverage including uncovered
    areas and performance flexibility to handle multiple application with different
    latency and throughput requirement. According to current statics, low data rate
    (<100kbps) applications i.e. M-IoT, are expected to form 60% of IoT connections
    in 2020 in comparison to medium and high data rate applications [12]. Hence most
    of the traffic will originate from cost-effective low-bit-rate services that will
    serve the connected world. Since massive communication between various low power
    IoT devices is different from H2H (Human-to-Human) in terms of delay sensitivity
    and traffic pattern, thus could not be supported by cellular technologies adequately.
    As they are designed for the different category of terminal that operates at a
    high data rate and consumes high power their device complexity is also high and
    thereby their cost, though it will aid in deployment of IoT. Apart from this,
    technologies such as Wi-Fi, BLE, ZigBee, etc., offer short range communications
    though consume less power. However, if deployed repeatedly will increase the cost.
    Hence not a cost effective solution for applications with wide coverage range
    requirements like M-IoT. Thus a technology is required that could support massive
    connection at reduced cost with low power consumption & provide enhanced coverage
    [13]. LPWAN technologies are one that could support this emerging market as it
    allows low power device to communicate at low data rate over wide area with radius
    of several kilometers. LPWA proffers abilities like Indoor penetration: as it
    uses Sub-1GHz band, the signal propagates more reliably with less power consumption
    as compared to 2.4GHz signal. Low power consumption is achieved at a cost of low
    data rate and latency on the higher end in seconds or minutes. This ability is
    achieved by using Duty cycling, by using star topology (usually), by allowing
    devices to directly connect to BS (thereby bifurcating the need of gateway & relays
    also) or by reducing burden on the device side(by using Fog or edge Computing).
    Further for Low cost, CAPEX (capital expenditure) & OPEX (operational expenditure)
    is reduced by reducing the complexity of hardware, implanting less no of BS (LPWA
    BS) etc. Massive connections, QoS are two abilities where still improvement is
    required. Standard bodies like ETSI, 3GPP, IEEE, IETF are actively working on
    LPWA technologies. A range of applications such as precision monitoring, Smart
    City, Home Automation, Industrial Asset monitoring, Logistics, Wildlife Monitoring,
    Smart meter, is being catered by LPWA technologies. As the LPWA market is expected
    to rule the market in coming years, hence competition among LPWA technologies
    becoming severe. Recently to improve the foundation of IoT through cellular networks,
    and tussle with existing proprietary LPWA technologies (LoRa, SigFox, RPMA, etc.),
    3GPP has introduced three technologies in Rel-13 namely eMTC (enhanced Machine
    Type Communication), NB-IoT, EC-GSM (enhanced coverage GSM). These cellular technologies
    will operate in licensed spectrum and will reuse the existing LTE infrastructure.
    Among available connecting technologies, NBIoT specifically tailored for emerging
    M-IoT market is one of the promising massive LPWA technology for data perception
    and acquisition for low data rate applications. NBIoT could handle massive connections
    with low power consumption and provide wide area coverage with deep indoor penetration
    and nomadic mobility [14]–[16]. Most outstandingly it offers reliable service
    by using licensed bands and avoid congestion problems. NB-IoT reduced the hardware
    complexity by 90% compared in comparison of LTE Cat-1. Moreover, NBIoT can coexist
    with existing GSM and LTE network, hence reduce deployment cost also. Beside this
    new RAT (Radio Access Technology) reduced the signaling required for the transmission
    of data in the conventional system. Altogether NB-IoT can reduce the cost and
    energy consumption, which are the chief limitations of cellular network technology
    for IoT devices. The present communication contributes toward the Next generation
    Green-NBIoT and delivers a comprehensive enriched study of NBIoT. This extensive
    survey elaborates resource allocation and energy efficiency techniques. Along
    with this a detailed comparative analysis of IoT connecting technology with NBIoT
    is also presented. Further, two novel application specific energy efficient approaches
    are also proposed namely “Zonal Thermal pattern Analysis” (ZTPA) and “Energy Efficiency
    Adaptive Health Monitoring System” (E2AHMS). Along with this real time hardware
    implementation of Health application is given to support the proposed energy efficient
    approach. This paper would be beneficial for researchers to get an insight view
    of NBIoT and their respective challenges. A. Market Trends Toward NBIoT IoT market
    growth has accelerated across all verticals in Q1 2018. Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is seen as one of the enablers for IoT. IoT Analytics in their report
    quoted that LPWA connections will have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of
    81% during 2018–2025 [17]. According to Machina in comparison of other LPWAN the
    share of NBIoT alone would be 48% by 2025 (Fig. 1) [18]. According to another
    statics, suggest by IHC the number of NBIoT connections by 2021 will be 141.7
    million [19]. Thereby NBIoT module revenue worldwide might touch the figure of
    USD 824 million by 2020 itself. Out of all NBIoT connections 88% of NBIoT connections
    will be established in Asia itself [20]. Some of the key NBIoT players are Huawei
    (China), Intel (U.S), Ericsson (Sweden), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Qualcomm
    (U.S), Vodafone (U.K). The growth of NB-IoT standard has increased pressure on
    proprietary technologies especially for LoRaWan and the fact of no of chips shipped
    in 2017: 2% of SigFox, 4 % of LTE-M, LoRaWan 58%, LTE-Cat M1 4%, NBIoT 29%, Other
    7% [18], are forestalling the market drift is building toward NBIoT. FIGURE 1.
    LPWA technology share by 2025, machina, 2017 [18]. Show All B. Research Motivation
    As per literature survey and research availability in the area of IoT, a lot of
    work has been done to deliver services like smart health, smart agriculture, smart
    vehicle, etc. In the current scenario, IoT has become the first choice of industry,
    research and academia. However, there exist big gap similar to WSN i.e. energy
    optimization, energy efficient network which acts as a big stumbling block for
    IoT network. This becomes even more challenging as IoT devices have limited resource
    availability. This motivated us to study resource allocation techniques in detail.
    Furthermore, implementation of IoT on a massive scale would inflate carbon emissions
    in one way or the other. Hence to envision the green communication energy efficiency
    techniques will play an important role. Apart from this to cater the new specificities
    of IoT (i.e. low cost devices, wide coverage, long battery life, massive connection
    support) in cost effective way, NBIoT (3GPP standardized LPWA technology) presents
    good candidature. In this paper with an effort toward green IoT, two energy efficiency
    techniques using NBIoT are also proposed related to two specific area Health &
    Agriculture which directly or indirectly impact the human being. C. Contribution
    This review paper contributes toward next generation green communication and in
    support of that two novel energy efficient techniques namely “ZTPA” & “E2AHMS”.
    This review paper will be beneficial for researchers, who want to get a profound
    view of NBIoT. Whilst discussing the recent background of NBIoT, significant challenges
    and open issues related to the real time implementation of NBIoT are identified
    and discussed. In this manuscript, a detailed study related to resource allocation,
    and energy efficiency techniques for both IoT and NBIoT is done. Our main contributions
    can be summarized as follow: The Layered Architecture of IoT is presented to specify
    How IoT works. In addition to this a detailed comparative analysis of NBIoT with
    other low power IoT communication technologies is discussed. To provide an insight
    view of NB-IoT, its background research, architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels, connection process (cell acquisition, random access process, data transfer),
    modes of operation, power consumption using NBIoT, and its applications are discussed
    in detail. The paucity of the resource is not a new challenge for the communication
    network. However, it quite challenging for IoT being so massively interconnected.
    Thus a detailed analysis of resource allocation techniques is discussed related
    to IoT and NBIoT The open issues related NBIoT implementation are then conferred
    The real time implementation of IoT will inflate the CO2 levels in environment
    in different ways which can be controlled by many ways one of it is efficient
    utilization of energy resource. Therefore a literature survey of an energy efficient
    techniques used for IoT are deliberated and role of deep learning in the context
    of power consumption is also discussed. The open issues relate to NBIoT are then
    conferred. Thereafter, Green communication based energy efficient techniques are
    proposed for Smart Agriculture and Smart Health. In addition to this, hardware
    implementation is given to support the proposed energy efficient Smart Health
    technique. The list of ongoing IoT projects is presented to provide the researchers
    and readers the knowledge of current applications being developed. In addition
    to this, a list of simulation tools used is also presented in the appendix section.
    D. Organization This paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses
    the basic layered architecture of IoT and specifies the layer on which NBIoT operates.
    Hereafter comparison of NBIoT with other IoT connecting technologies is discussed
    in section III. Thereafter, NBIoT introduction, background research, standardization
    history from Rel-8 to Rel-15, subsequently architecture, frame structure, physical
    channels and signals used, connection process, modes of operation, power consumption
    using NBIoT, applications of NBIoT, are described in subsections IV-A, IV-B, IV-C,
    IV-D, IV-E, IV-F, IV-G, IV-H, IV-I respectively. Further section V provides a
    comprehensive survey of efficient resource allocation techniques used for NBIoT
    & IoT. Thereafter an overview of energy consumption in a sensor node during different
    phases is presented in section VI. Other than this, a detailed survey of energy
    efficiency techniques for green communication are discussed in detail in section
    VI-A and then the impact of usage of deep learning on power consumption is discussed
    in section-VI-B. Then the open issues related to NBIoT are discussed in section
    VII. Finally, the proposed green communication based energy efficient technique
    for agriculture is discussed in section VIII-A, and for health monitoring is discussed
    in VIII-B. In support of the proposed health technique a real time hardware implementation
    is described in section VIII-C subsuming system model (VIII-C-i), hardware requirement
    (VIII-C-ii), interface (VIII-C-iii), and performance analysis (VIII-C-iv). SECTION
    II. Internet of Things Communication and sensing ability has evolved gradually
    due to advancement in technology. The evolution of IoT (Fig. 2) started with RFID
    (radio frequency identification), which is the first technology to realize the
    machine to machine concept. RFID detects and ascertains the tagged entity wirelessly,
    by the data it transmits. Recently RFID is used in numerous IoT applications such
    as gestural detection [21], patient RFID tracking system [22], and smart restaurant.
    RFID could not sense the critical environment parameters, this stems in the requirement
    of sensing technologies. Hereafter, several technical fields including embedded
    computing, hardware miniaturization, Wireless networking aids in augmentation
    of real-world things capability, to sense, think, process and act, thus making
    things smart. Usually, these smart things have low computation capability thus
    clouds are used to offload the computational task which in turn reduce the energy
    consumption. Today the integration of. RFID, WSN, MCC (mobile cloud computing)
    and advancement in technology generated the umbrella term IoT. This concept is
    significantly revolutionizing the technical and business world, as it can offers
    anytime, anywhere, and anything service. The term IoT was first coined by Kevin
    Aston in 1999 also known as “cyber-physical systems (CPS)” [24]. In this paradigm,
    object/things around us are connected to the internet using Wireless technologies
    like Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. Many definitions of IoT have been proposed in the
    literature. According to IERC, IoT is “A dynamic global infrastructure with self-configuring
    capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocol where
    physical and virtual things have identities, physical attributes, virtual personalities,
    and use intelligent interface and seamlessly integrated into information network”
    [25]. IoT network, comprised of billions of devices is highly heterogeneous. Its
    essence of heterogeneity can be visualized by the fact that devices from different
    vendors would run with diverse platforms even if they’re doing the same task as
    a result will generate radically different ontologies. Thus for IoT to speak a
    common language a unified standardized IoT architecture is required to ensure
    interoperability and security. Many architectural layouts have been proposed for
    IoT but no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Some of the well-known
    IoT architecture such as RAMI 4.0, IIRA, IoT- ARM, P2413, Arrowhead Framework,
    WSO2, Microsoft Azure, Internet-of-everything reference Model, Intel IoT Platform
    Reference Architecture are available. Among variously available architecture this
    paper presents a five-layer architecture (Fig. 3): comprised of Perception Layer,
    network layer, Service management Layer, Application Layer, Business layer [1].
    Perception Layer: This layer is composed of sensor/actuators. Here sensors are
    clustered according to their unique abilities such as body sensors, environmental
    sensors, vehicle parking sensors, home appliance sensors etc. Typically these
    sensors at the perception layer generate electronic signals triggered from physical
    event/condition aggregated at gateways using LAN/PAN technologies like Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, UWB, ZigBee, BLE, Infrared, etc. FIGURE 2. Roadmap of IoT [2]. Show
    All FIGURE 3. Layered architecture of IoT [23]. Show All Network Layer: This layer
    is responsible to send the PL information to the Internet via one of the communication
    networks such as LAN (WIFI, Ethernet), WAN (3G, LTE, LTE-A, 5G) or satellite network.
    Service Management Layer (SML): On SML services are paired based on addresses
    and it also processes the data received. These services are OSS (Operational Support
    System) which include device modeling, Performance management, Data management
    (periodic/Aperiodic sensed data) etc. (e.g. Nokia OSS which help in generating
    new revenues by handling high capacity.), BSS (Billing Support System) this provide
    billing report, and Security Services. Application Layer: Here application layer
    is classified based on the availability of network, required coverage, heterogeneity,
    etc. Using protocols like MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport), CoAP (Constrained
    Application Protocol) this layer provides the requested service to the user. Business
    Layer: This layer is responsible to analyze data received from the Application
    layer by building the business model, flowcharts, graphs, etc. thereby enable
    to support decision-making processes. Thus IoT flow can be defined as first identification
    (to provide clear identification to each device), then sensing gather data from
    the physical environment), thereafter communication, then integration of service
    and finally extraction of knowledge. The new IoT specificities like low power
    and Wide Range, Low deployment and Operational Costs, Long Battery life (10mA
    RX current, 100nA sleep current), Low bitrates, are different from conventional
    networks in many aspects and brings in many challenges. Beside this massive connectivity
    will further aggravate the problem. However, a solution is appearing on the horizon:
    is 3GPP, NB-IoT which can cater these requirements in an effective manner. As
    IoT has a diverse and wide range of IoT requirement, hence one solution won’t
    fit for all. Therefore in the next section a detail comparative analysis of NBIoT
    and other IoT related technologies is discussed. SECTION III. Comparison of NBIot
    With Other IoT Connecting Technologies A myriad of IoT connectivity solutions
    is available to support a wide range of IoT application with miscellaneous requirements.
    Therefore to select an optimal technology for an application various factors such
    as power consumption, security issues, deployment cost, communication range, data
    rate, throughput, latency are required to be considered [26], [27]. A comparison
    of IoT connecting solutions on pre-specified factor is given in Table 1. Connecting
    Technologies of IoT can be coarsely classified into two categories based on their
    range i.e. short and long range. Wireless technologies such as BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Z-wave, WIMAX, 6LOWPAN, etc. offer short range can be used for applications like
    smart home, factory or supermarket. Whereas, LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,
    SigFox, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IOT, etc. offer long range. Other than the pre-specified
    competing technologies RPMA, Telensa, WAVIoT and Dash 7 are few other competing
    technologies contributing to IoT connectivity [28]. TABLE 1 Comparison of IoT
    Connecting Technologies Among wireless technologies, Wi-Fi uses radio waves for
    communication and operates in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz band. The existing Wi-Fi standards
    802.11 a/b/g/n/ac has constraints in both range and energy efficiency, thus can’t
    be considered apposite for applications with low power consumption requisite.
    Thus IEEE has introduced two new protocols 802.11ah and 802.11ax that can support
    thousands of devices with low power consumption. These two are considered to be
    the biggest move of IEEE towards the massive IoT market. The Wi-Fi standard 802.11ah–HaLow
    provide a range of 1km and can easily penetrate barriers/obstacles at data rate
    ranging from 150kbps to 40Mbps. The 802.11ax solution will provide four time’s
    increased capacity and data rate and improved efficiency. These new solutions
    have great potential to capture the M2M market. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is
    another Wireless standard that offers much needed characteristic required for
    most of IoT applications i.e. consumes low power, low cost, but within a short
    range. BLE allows both connectionless and connection-oriented communication. It
    fragments the data into small packets then transmit them over the radio interface.
    This enables BLE to support data services with large packets. It is used in applications
    like wearables, for locating things, etc. Further ZigBee is a simple and low cost
    Wireless option that consumes low power. It is based on IEEE 802 std. and could
    support ~ 65000 nodes/network. Its range can be extended by using repeaters in
    the mesh topology, but this will increase the deployment cost [29]. ZigBee 3.0
    is the new solution introduces, it ensures device interoperability, it is reliable
    robust and above all it is green. Z-Wave is another pioneer for short range communication,
    especially for home-automation industry. As it provides a reliable method to wirelessly
    control multiple home appliances using low-power. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range, around 900MHz. It can support up to approximately 232 nodes/network.
    The Frequently Listening receiver Slave (FLiRs) enable low latency communication
    by employing unique beaming technology so that device can transit from sleep to
    fully awake modes in one second. Hence suitable for short range IoT application.
    Z-Wave 700 Series, could offer a range of 300 feet, hence can connect gadgets
    placed outside the home and far off into the yard, too [30]. Despite offering
    low power consumption and low cost, Wireless technologies limits in supporting
    long distance communication. Hence offers limited mobility and deployment possibilities
    for the device. Moreover, to extend the range, repeaters are required to be deployed
    densely, thus extortionately expensive. Whereas, LPWA technologies offer mass
    deployment, long range, long battery life, and require low bandwidth. Hence LPWA
    fills a cavity in the landscape of Wireless technologies. LPWAN technologies can
    be categorized into two categories Licensed and Unlicensed. Long Range (LoRa),
    SigFox, RPMA, N-Wave and Dash 7 are unlicensed, NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT, LTE-M are licensed
    technologies [31], [32]. LoRa is developed by Semtech, to deploy its network it
    is required to get a NetID issued from LoRa Alliance. It uses an Adaptive Data
    Rate (ADR) scheme which helps in extending the battery lifetime. It is based on
    Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation technique, which sustains the same low power
    characteristics as FSK modulation yet considerably increases the communication
    range. LoRa-WAN being asynchronous let devices to remain in sleep mode for a long
    time period as desired by the application. Another advantage of LoRa is its BS
    provide wide coverage. However, as LoRa operates in unlicensed spectrum thus could
    not provide QoS and neither it could support dense network as it employs MAC based
    ALOHA protocol [33]. SigFox is another technology that operates in unlicensed
    sub 1GHz band. It operates on cloud based approach and uses ALOHA like LoRa but
    with a restriction on the maximum number of messages, a device could send. The
    prime advantage of SigFox is it doesn’t spend energy on sensing medium thus saves
    energy. SigFox requires the user to purchase subscription. In order to provide
    long range communication it uses Ultra-Narrow-band modulation and transfers each
    message 100 Hz wide with a data rate of 100/600 bps depending on the region. Ingenu
    is another LPWAN technology offers high throughput, high scalability, and use
    patented Random Phase Multiple Access scheme. RPMA helps in improving SNR by minimizing
    the overlapping between signals transmitted. It is slightly more complex as it
    uses TDMA based MAC protocol to efficiently allocate the radio resource [34].
    Another LPWAN technology WEIGHTLESS-P, uses cognitive radio and TV white-spaces,
    such that devices utilize the bands as an opportunistic user without causing interference
    to the primary user. It supports two way communication thereby acknowledges all
    transmissions, further in order to maintain QoS and to assure reliability Automatic
    retransmission request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used [36].
    Taking about existing cellular technology LTE could not provide solutions for
    M-IoT applications i.e. Low power consumption, low data rates, and wider coverage
    at low cost. Thus 3GPP proposed a licensed LTE-M / eMTC, in Rel-12 to cater the
    requirements of machine type communication which has been optimized in Rel-13.
    It leverages the existing LTE network and follows narrowband operation for reception
    and transmission and provides extended coverage. To reduce power consumption it
    used PSM (power saving mode) and edRx mode [37]. NBIoT (Narrow Band IoT), is another
    licensed technology introduced by 3GPP in Rel-13. NB-IoT in comparison to other
    technologies offer mMTC required features at low cost like (i) provide coverage
    in challenging positions like underground or basements; (ii) improved power saving
    mechanisms to enhance the battery life; (iii) network procedures are simplified
    to reduce the UE complexity. Apart from this to support small data transfer it
    has optimized CIoT User Plane and Control Plane Another technology EC-GSM is also
    proposed by 3GPP which is an extension of existing GSM technology. Suitable for
    many applications, but it overburdens the device and network [38]. Conclusion:
    For M-IoT applications, individually all LPWAN technologies are prompt in one
    way or the other for wide range solutions but picking a clear winner is critical.
    LoRa, SigFox being proprietary technology has an established market and giving
    a tough fight to 3GPP NBIoT, EC-GSM-IoT and others also. However proprietary technologies
    operate in Unauthorized/Unlicensed Spectrum that suffers from Duty Cycle constraint.
    Thus affects the transmission time and also bears high interference as spectrum
    is shared between multiple technologies. Whereas, NBIoT operate in licensed spectrum
    and can support massive connections, operates at low data rates (but better than
    LoRa), offer wide coverage with deep indoor penetration, perform well in dense
    area, consumes less power in comparison to LoRa, & SigFox, offers very good link
    budgets and good scalability, provide QoS Apart from this just require a software
    update to LTE or existing RAN infrastructure. Thus ready to immediate role out
    in the market. This is essential for reducing deployment cost and time [39], [40].
    Hence this ascertains that NBIoT has the ability to capture the IoT-LPWAN market
    specifically in comparison to other LPWAN Technologies SECTION IV. NBIoT: Narrow
    Band Internet of Things NB-IoT is the latest technology that is identified and
    standardized in a little time span, in the response of customer requirement and
    pressure to tussle with non-3GPP proprietary technologies. NBIoT can efficiently
    support the market of the M-IoT application. This an independent radio interface,
    tightly connected with LTE, which also shows up in its integration in the current
    LTE specifications [12], [13], [41], [42]. It can address the needs of mMTC (massive
    Machine Type Communication) by following features (Fig. 4): FIGURE 4. NBIoT features.
    Show All NBIoT can support massive connections (more than 52K/channel): as in
    MTC communication model user, transfer small data at low frequency and are insensitive
    to latency so multiple users can camp on one cell. Further, NBIoT supports two
    schemes multi-tone and single-tone transmission. This offers flexibility to schedule
    12 subcarriers with sub spacing of 15 kHz or 48 subcarriers with sub spacing of
    3.75 kHz with single tone scheduling. Hence eNodeB could support large no of users
    in parallel. NBIoT uses a bandwidth of 180 KHz and operates in HD-FDD: In NBIoT,
    UL/DL bandwidth is restricted to 180 kHz. Hence less complex transceiver is used.
    Further, the device operates in Half Duplex mode, thus can’t receive and transmit
    simultaneously. This further decrease device cost, as no duplexer will be required.
    NBIoT design objective is to provide prolonged battery life: For long battery
    life, power Consumption is reduced by using eDRX (extended discontinuous reception)
    and PSM (power saving modes) features. In extended discontinuous reception, the
    UE monitors the paging channel periodically. Whereas in PSM, the device remains
    in receiving state. NBIoT provides extend coverage range of 20dB as compare to
    GPRS (especially deep indoor penetration): To provide the wide coverage the transport
    block can be transmitted multiple times i.e. 128 times in UL and 2048 in DL. Hence
    improves Signal to noise-interference ratio (SINR) and enable proper decoding
    of the signal. To determine the number of repetitions for coverage extensions,
    three classes are defined CE level 0, CE level 1 and CE level 2. For each of these
    class, the number of repetitions is regulated separately. Beside this soft retransmission
    the network bandwidth is also reduced. Hence based on two features 20 dB coverage
    enhancement is achieved where ~7dB is achieved from network bandwidth reduction
    and ~13 dB from allowed repeated transmissions. NBIoT offers operating mode flexibility:
    In order to coexist with LTE and 2G, three deployment modes are available standalone,
    in-band and standalone. NBIoT doesn’t support higher modulation scheme than QPSK,
    thus keep device complexity low and thereby cost. Moreover, to keep the PAPR (peak
    to average power ratio) low in UL, π /2-BPSK, π /4- QPSK is used. NBIoT supports
    Low-Data-Rate applications, which obsolete the requirement for high-capacity flash
    memory hence reduce the chip area and thereby the cost of devices. NBIoT operates
    in Licensed Band and can provide telecommunication level of security. NBIoT achieved
    signaling optimization: In addition to existing RRC, NBIoT uses DONAS (data over
    non access stratum) and RRC (radio resource control) suspend/resume for signaling
    optimization. Where DONAS enable the user to transmit data without activating
    a user plane and support sporadic data transmissions also. The RRC suspend/resume
    is a user plane optimization procedure that introduced an efficient way to disable
    and restore the user plane. Further, NB-IoT is designed for sporadic and small
    messages transmission among the device and the network. It is presumed that the
    device can exchange small messages via one cell, therefore obsolete the requirement
    of handoffs. However, if required then it needs to first go in idle state and
    then restart the cell selection process. Besides this, it doesn’t support other
    EUTRA functions like Inter-RAT-mobility, handover, dual connectivity, CQI (Channel
    Quality Indicator) reporting. A. Background of NBIoT NBIoT is in the initial state
    of deployment, still, there is room for optimization. The miscellaneous work carried
    out in the context of NBIoT optimization is discussed in this section. Song et
    al. [43] proposed an indoor localization algorithm for NB-IoT system using Channel
    state information (CSI) fingerprinting. The proposed algorithm will estimate the
    position with less complexity by observing the similarity between two CSI values
    and then convert the similar value to a relative value. To improve estimation
    of position, triangular centroid algorithm and K nearest neighbor is used. As
    a result, the position error was reduced in comparison to existing techniques.
    Further, to enable a node, in an idle state to transmit the data. Lin et al. [44]
    proposed an efficient SDT (Smallest Data Transmission) technique to increase the
    number of the supportable device. In this eNB will broadcast the maximum SDT size
    in SIB (system information block), and also a group of SDT ids with it. Thereafter,
    UE will check the SDT value and determine whether to use this technique or not.
    If suitable then send the RA response. Successively, eNB will acknowledge by sending
    RA response comprised of uplink resource grant. UE on successful reception will
    send the PDU and starts the timer. Upon receiving the response within time, UE
    compares its id with group ids. As a result, authors found that more devices could
    be supported in comparison of conventional control plane solutions, whilst using
    limited uplink resources. However massive connection results in the high probability
    of collision thus Kim et al. [45] proposed an enhanced Access- Reservation-Protocol
    (EARP) with a partial preamble transmission mechanism. The proposed protocol although
    reduced the collision probability but at the cost of abdication of the detection
    ability. Authors found that EARP would results in effective resource utilization
    in reference to system load. When the load will be less then it will reduces the
    probability of misdetection. On the other hand, when a heavy load would be there,
    the collision probability gets reduced although the detection probability get
    deteriorates. Further Zhang et al. [46] done an analysis of interference caused
    by the NBIoT user equipment to that of LTE users. Authors considered only in-band
    and guard band for analysis and proposed an algorithm for removal of ISI or channel
    equalization. On the basis of observation, the authors stated that LTE-UE performance
    degrades due to the different sampling rate of NBIoT user. In addition to this,
    the level of interference depends upon specifically two important factors. First
    due to attenuation of power and second is due to guard band. A critical observation
    about bit error rate is made for an LTE device i.e. its BER will improve as guard-band
    bandwidth increases although for IoT devices BER remains unaffected. Liu et al.
    [47] taking the same issue of interference between NBIoT and LTE devices have
    proposed a framework based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) and two algorithms
    for recovery of signals. Authors observed that by canceling the interfering NB-IoT
    signal, LTE device could operate more effectively. Further, Lin et al. [48] proposed
    a single tone design for NPRACH (narrowband physical random access channel) and
    this work was integrated into 3GPP Rel-13. To reduce the overhead due to cyclic
    prefix (CP) N-samples are repeated n times and then collectively CP corresponding
    to these samples is added, as a result, the length of CP got reduced. After this
    single carrier hopping is used where within symbols fixed hopping is used and
    among different symbol groups, pseudo-random hopping is applied. Further, the
    time of arrival (ToA) & carrier frequency offset (CFO) is jointly estimated to
    determine the midsection and false alarm. As a result, the authors observed that
    using the proposed design the probability of detection increased up to 99% and
    the probability of false-alarm reduced immensely below 0.1%. Further, Yang et
    al. [49] suggested using effective bandwidth (EB) to collectively handle all the
    components of LPWAN i.e. battery life, coverage, Tx (transmission) bandwidth,
    spectral efficiency. According to the suggested, concept if Tx bandwidth would
    be greater than EB, this would ultimately reduce the system capacity. On the other
    hand, if Tx would be less than EB, this would entail more Tx time. However, the
    journey of optimization doesn’t end here. There are various open issues that are
    still required to be addressed to envisage NBIoT success. Some of them are discussed
    in section VII. B. History of Standardization Before standardization, of NBIoT.
    It was proposed in two formats. NBIoT-OFDMA and NBIoT-M2M in 2014. Where QUALCOMM
    offered NBIoT-OFDMA & Huawei and Vodafone collectively offered NBIoT-M2M. These
    two formats were clubbed together to form NB-CIoT (NB cellular IoT), which require
    a new chipset and has no backward compatibility with previous LTE Rel (8-12).
    Further, another format NBIoT-LTE was proposed in 2015 which is fully compatible
    with existing LTE specifications. Then finally in 2016, 3GPP after agreeing on
    two proposals gave standardized technology NBIoT. This technology has evolved
    over years of improvement. In this section, the roadmap of standardization (from
    Rel-8 to 15) is discussed to determine the improvement made (in these Rel) to
    support MTC. Well standardization of LTE started in 2005 when 3GPP started depth
    research for MTC on CN. In 2009, Rel-8 was standardization [50] and brought in
    the feature like peak DL data rate of 300Mbps with an ability to operate in paired
    and unpaired frequency band. Thus have spectral flexibility with bandwidth ranging
    from 1.4 to 20 MHz A new IP based network was introduced i.e. LTE, was a significant
    step toward the IMT-A. In addition to this, to cater the need of multiple users,
    multiple antenna scenario came in to picture since the first Rel of 3GPP [51].
    However the basic requirement of low cost device and power issues left unattended.
    Thereafter Rel-9 standardized in 2010 in which LTE evolved to LTE-Advance and
    introduced additional features such as public warning system (PWS), location Identification
    service, SON (Self Organizing Network) feature to improve the network configuration,
    added new spectrum bands. Further in 2011 Rel-10 (also known as LTE-Advanced)
    was launched to extensively improve the throughput of the LTE system. For evaluation
    of Rel-10, it was submitted to ITU-R in 2010. In Rel-10, to enhance the bandwidth
    and bitrate, Carrier Aggregation was used for both TDD & FDD [52] and to reduce
    the interference, eICIC (enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination) was added,
    where ABS (Almost Blank Subframes) is used to confine the data to the specific
    layer of the cell. Other features like eMIMO, etc. were also introduced. Further,
    Rel-11 [53] got frozen in 2013. An important feature CoMP (Co-ordinated Multi
    Point operation) was announced to facilitate the scheduling of multiple carriers.
    EPDCCH (Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel) was added to increase DLC
    (downlink-Capacity). Furthermore, Rel-12 [54], [55] got standardized in 2015.
    In this NAICS (Network Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression) was
    added to manage interference. To achieve QoE, naïve UE categories were introduced
    with 50% reduced cost in comparison to Rel-8, cat-1 devices. In support of machine
    type communication, PSM (power saving mode) was also introduced to conserve energy.
    Finally in Rel 13 [56], [57] to further cater the need of Machine to machine type
    communication, a new feature added to existing Rel-8-12: SCPTM (single cell point
    to multi-point), indoor-positioning, reduced latency, Dual connectivity and enhanced
    CA. LAA (licensed assisted access) was also introduced to allow operators to offload
    traffic to the femtocell, devoid of WLAN Two naïve category of devices were introduced
    in Rel 13 Cat-M1 (eMTC) and Cat-NB1 (NBIoT). Where the system bandwidth was confined
    to 1.4 MHz and coverage range was enhanced by 15 dB for Cat-M1 devices. Altogether
    reduced the device complexity and cost enabled operators to reach terminal devices
    in poor coverage range like in basements. For assurance of long battery life eDRX
    (extended Discontinuous Reception) feature was introduced that monitors the DL
    signals for only a short span of time otherwise keep the device in the sleep state.
    For the further evolution of LTE to support mMTC Rel-14 is also standardized with
    more technologies and improvement in existing features such as Additional Broadcast
    services, enhanced positioning, reduced latency, and massive multi antenna system.
    Currently, Rel-15 is under standardization process and expected to get standardize
    by September 2018 [56]. The expected features of Rel-15 are also enlisted in Table
    2. TABLE 2 Standardization History Toward NBIoT [12] C. NBIoT Network Architecture
    The architecture of NBIoT is shown in Fig. 5, NBIoT has simplified the EPC architecture
    to support the small data transmissions required for M-IoT applications in the
    form of User Plane and the Control Plane EPC optimization. FIGURE 5. NBIoT architecture
    [58]. Show All Here NB-IoT device or user equipment communicates with the eNodeB
    thereafter eNodeB connects with the IoT evolved packet core (EPC). This is comprised
    of entities: the Serving GW, the Packet Data Network GW, the Mobility management
    plane entity, the Home Subscriber server. After this eNodeB transfers the NAS
    (non-access stratum, a signaling message) to EPC using s1-lite (an optimized version
    of S1-Control-Plane and support efficient data handling). Basically, NAS is a
    protocol that transfers the non-radio signal between the user equipment and MME,
    which carries data for session and mobility management. Further to continue the
    processing EPC looks for stratum and then pass it to IoT platform. IoT platform
    forwards the data to application servers in supported form. This data is then
    processed by the Application server [58]. There are two ways in which data could
    be transmitted between NBIoT device and application server i.e. IP based and Non-IP
    based. However, Non-IP based is more endorsed since it reduces the overhead of
    user equipment and transmission is also more secure as only one target IP is supported.
    D. NBIoT Frame Structure Downlink: The frame structure of NBIoT DL is identical
    to LTE. In Time domain a radio frame is comprised of 10 Subframes, each having
    length of 1ms and each subframe consists of 2 slots with a time slot of seven
    OFDM symbols (Fig. 6 A) Here each OFDM symbol with in a frame is denoted by a
    number in the range 0 to 13. Further, the number of these radio frames is referred
    as the system frame number (SFN) which ranges from 0 to 1023. Once the SFN counter
    reaches the value of 1023, the counter is reset to 0 and thereafter the hyper
    SFN counter is increased. The hyper SFN ranges between 0 and 1023. Within each
    radio frame, the sub frames are labeled as 0 to 9 and the slots as 0 to 19. In
    Frequency domain, one physical resource block consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers
    with a spacing of 15 kHz [40]. FIGURE 6. Frame structure of NBIoT [59]. Show All
    Uplink: The UL resource grid has two subcarrier spacing options i.e.15 kHz and
    3.75 kHz. In time domain: with a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz each slot has a
    duration of.5ms, the number of subcarriers will be 12 which is similar to the
    time domain. However, for the 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing, total number of subcarriers
    in the frequency domain is 4 times i.e. 12*4=48 subcarriers. The slot duration
    will be of 2ms [40]. E. Physical Channels and Signals 1) Uplink Channels and Signals
    Since NBIoT enabled UE’s operates in extreme coverage areas and have limited power
    to operate. Pertaining to this, to reduce the power consumption and complexity
    UE is no longer asked to report a channel, thus their functionality reduced to
    send acknowledgment and No- acknowledgment. Apart from this the need of control
    channel is also obsoleted and only two UL channels are supported namely NPRACH,
    NPUSCH. a: NPRACH: Narrowband Physical Random-Access Channel NPRACH refers to
    the time frequency resource which occupies contiguous set of subcarriers either
    12, 24, 36 or 48 and used to transmit random access preambles. This preamble consist
    of four symbol groups, each group comprised of one Cycle Prefix (CP) and 5 symbols
    [48]. These preambles are repeated with a periodicity from 0.04 s to 2.56 s. The
    eNB uses the random access preamble sent by a user terminal to estimate the uplink
    timing. To start the random access process the preamble is transmitted with a
    duration of 5.6ms or 6.4ms. Further in order to support different cell size two
    CP lengths are specified in NPRACH, 66.67 μs and 266.7 μs . Where 66.67 μs is
    used for cells with radii not more than 8 km and 266.7 μs is used for cell with
    radii range of 8 – 35 km. Each symbol is modulated on a 3.75 kHz tone, which hops
    from one tone to another within twelve contiguous subcarriers. Further for efficient
    estimation of TOA (Time of Arrival) and to achieve improved synchronization between
    UE and eNB, frequency hopping is used. For this two layer hopping pattern is defined
    i.e. inner hopping & output hopping. In order to provide wide TOA range, inner
    hopping is used with fixed (for simplicity) and small values. However, an output
    hopping layer accounts to improve the accuracy of TOA estimation. Furthermore
    to alleviate cell interference between neighboring cells, the pseudo random hopping
    pattern is also used which has been inherited from the LTE PUSCH hopping. Finally
    to support coverage extension of +20dB GPRS, the preamble of four symbol groups
    can be repeated up to 128 times [59]. b: NPUSCH: Narrowband Physical Uplink Shared
    Channel The NPUSCH supports single tone transmission with either 3.75 kHz or 15
    kHz and multitone bandwidth using 15 kHz subcarrier spacing. The NPUSCH has two
    formats. Format 1 carries the actual data in the uplink with maximum transmission
    block size of 1000 bits. Format1 facilitate multitone transmission with 3,6,12
    tones. Other than this to decrease the PAPR (Peak to Average Power ratio the modulation
    scheme π /2-BPSK or π /4-QPSK is used for single-tone and QPSK is used for multi-tone
    for NPUSCH Format 1. Furthermore, Format 2 carries control information, supports
    single-tone transmission only and carries 1-bit UCI that corresponds to hybrid
    automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback for NB-PDSCH transmission block. Table
    3 describes the format 1 and format 2. Typically the NPUSCH is designed to provide
    long battery life, massive capacity and extended coverage [14], [59]. TABLE 3
    NPUSCH Format [59] c: DMRS: Demodulation Reference Signal In LTE, DMRS is used
    to obtain channel response for PUSCH. Similar to enable eNB to estimate the UL
    channel, the NBIoT-UE transmits a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) which is
    multiplexed with the NPUSCH symbols. Thereby depending on Format of NPUSCH (ie.
    Format 1or Format 2), (Fig. 7) 1or 3 symbols per SC-FDMA slot are utilized to
    transmit the DMRS. With 15 kHz subcarrier spacing DMRS is allocated to symbol
    #3 of every 7 symbols and for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing. DMRS is allocated to
    5th symbol of every 7 symbols for data transmission [40]. FIGURE 7. DMRS allocation
    in 15 kHz &3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing [60]. Show All 2) Downlink Channels and
    Signals The NBIoT physical downlink channels are QPSK modulated. The downlink
    designs of NB-IoT MAC and PHY are analogous to the LTE. However, NB-IoT has fewer
    downlink physical channels as compared to LTE. For example, NBIoT doesn’t use
    PMCH (Physical Multicast Channel) as it doesn’t support multimedia broadcast/multicast
    services (till Rel-13) [61], [62]. a: DL Synchronization Signals The downlink
    synchronization signals allow a device to synchronize to NBIoT cell. However,
    the detection of these signals is a challenging task. As when a device with low-power
    oscillator wakes up after a long period of deep sleep, the time base will not
    have a valid reference then, and the frequency base perhaps off by as ~20 ppm.
    Hence a large offset may exist between the device and the network time and frequency,
    which will seriously harm the acquisition performance. The frequency offset is
    due to factors such as temperature, crystal aging, etc. Out of all “temperature”
    is the crucial factor that majorly affects the accuracy, and hence required to
    be compensated in real time. Depending on the quality of the crystal the offset
    ranges from ±5 ppm to ±100 ppm [63], [64]. Hence to detect with large frequency
    offset NBIoT new Synchronization signals NPSS (Narrowband Primary Synchronization
    Signal) is designed which is transmitted in Subframe 5 of duration 1 ms with a
    sequence pattern periodicity of 10 ms and subcarrier spaced at 15 kHz. The hierarchical
    sequence of NPSS is generated using (1) [65] P k (l)=Q(k) e −jπul(l+1)/ 11 , (1)
    View Source Where Q(k)= {1, 1, 1, 1,−1,−1, 1, 1,−1, 1} is the modulation sequence,
    1≤l≤11 (length), 3≤k≤14 (OFDM symbols) and u=5 is the root sequence. Its detection
    is a demanding computational operation from UE perspective. This detection may
    account for at least 24% of the power consumption. However, to keep the device
    complexity low, devices are required to search for only one NPSS as all the cells
    use the same NPSS in NB-IoT network. In contrast to this LTE network uses three
    PSSs. Although, in order to get one copy of NPSS, 19,200 samples need to be captured
    with a sub-frame of the length of 10 ms, with 1.92 MHz sampling rate. Hereafter
    to ascertain the cell identity out of 504 cell-ids available and to acquire additional
    information about the frame structure NSSS (Narrowband Secondary Synchronization
    Signal) is used. It is transmitted in subframe 9 with a subframe periodicity of
    20ms. Hence NSSS sequences are transmitted four times in 80-ms repetition interval
    are differentiated by the phase shift. It uses the last 11 OFDM symbols that consist
    of 132 resource elements overall. Unlike legacy LTE, cell ID is enclosed in the
    secondary sequence without including the primary sequence. NSSS, ZC 131 (Zadoff-Chu

    frames having n f mod2=0 . b: Physical Channels i) NBPBCH: Narrow-Band Physical
    Broadcast Channel NB-PBCH reside in subframe 0 in every radio frame and carries
    the MIB (Master Information Block). It provide information about system bandwidth,
    SFN (system Frame Number), No of antenna ports. NB-PBCH, MIB consists of 8 independently
    decodable blocks of each of 80 ms duration. Where each block is repeated 8 times
    consecutively to manage with extreme coverage conditions. Hence MIB remains unchanged
    for the time span of 640 ms (Fig. 9). The NB-IOT determines the number of cell
    antenna ports whilst demodulating MIB information. Other than this MIB also provide
    information about operation mode. NB-PBCH reuses the functionalities from legacy
    LTE PBCH such as CRC generation and attachment, Tail biting convolutional encoding,
    Rate matching, Scrambling, Modulation, Layer mapping. FIGURE 8. NPSS & NSSS subframe
    [61]. Show All FIGURE 9. Mapping of NBPBCH [59]. Show All ii) NPDCCH: Narrowband
    Physical Downlink Control Channel The NPDCCH is used to carry DCI (Downlink Control
    Information). Basically, a device needs to monitor NPDCCH to obtain three types
    of information mentioned below. NBIoT has own control channel different from LTE-MTC
    system, although some features have been inherited. Typically NPDCCH is apt for
    transporting scheduling information. Moreover, as NBIoT supports only HDD mode
    thus transmission of NPDCCH is packet based [63]. Besides this to keep the power
    consumption low on UE side, the payload size of DCI (downlink control information)
    is kept up to 23 bits for UL grant or DL assignment for NPDCCH. Hence three new
    DCI formats have been defined as Format N0, Format N1, and Format N2. The usage
    of these formats is specified in Table 4. Further, NPDCCH consists of Narrowband
    control channel elements (NCCEs) where resource elements are mapped. A subframe
    has two NCCEs, analogous to the upper six and lower six subcarriers and for NCCE
    mapping (Fig. 10). TABLE 4 DCI Formats [14], [61] FIGURE 10. NPDCCH subframe structure
    [62]. Show All iii) Narrowband Physical Downlink Shared Channel (NPDSCH) The NPDSCH
    is the core data bearing channel used for transmission of unicast data, broadcast
    information such as SI (System Information) messages. It segments the data packet
    received from higher layer into transmission blocks and transmits one at a time.
    The resource mapping is done in an almost similar manner as NPDCCH beside two
    differences. One, that NPDSCH carry only one TB (maximum TB size is limited to
    680 bits) though NPDCCH can multiplex resources in a subframe to transmit two
    DCI messages. Secondly, if the subframe transmits the SIB1-NB then starting OFDM
    symbol in an NPDCCH subframe will be different from NPDSCH subframe in the in-band
    mode. The NPDSCH TB is processed as follows. Firstly, the CRC of 24-bit is evaluated
    and then attached to the TB. Then TB is encoded via the tail biting convolutional
    coding encoder and rate-matched owing to code-word length deduced collectively
    from the number of NPDSCH sub-frames assigned to the TB and on the basis of the
    number of REs per subframe. Accordingly, the coding rate is determined by size
    of TB and the number of NPDSCH Subframes allotted to the TB combination. Henceforward
    before mapping the encoded TB bits to QPSK symbols, the bits are scrambled i.e.
    the subframe is repeated min (NREP, 4) times before the mapping of the code word
    continues. For each repetition, the scrambling code differs. The maximum no of
    repetitions allowed are 2048 to achieve the SNR of −12.6dB. The repeated Subframes
    allow a device to decode the code word before the transmission completes [64].
    F. NBIoT Connection Process 1) Cell Selection Process A device can be in idle
    or connected mode while looking for the cell to camp on. If the device wakes up
    from a deep sleep then it obtains the information about most recently used (MRU)
    cells using cell selection protocols. In case none of the cell is found suitable
    or if device is powered on for the first time, it is required to perform a full
    frequency scan to find a new cell to camp on. The fundamental purpose of cell
    selection is to identify and synchronize to a suitable NB-IoT cell. In this context,
    the first foremost step is to time synchronize and then obtain a CFO estimated
    value. In order to achieve NPSS synchronization, its autocorrelation properties
    must be exploited. Hence when device achieves the time synchronization, then using
    next frames it determines the CFO. For device located in extreme coverage conditions,
    large number of NPSS frames are required to be detected. Once the symbol time
    is determined and the CFO is compensated for in-band or guard-band, still, an
    additional raster offset will exist up to 7.5 kHz. Consequently, this raster offset
    drifts the symbol time either in the forward or backward direction due to overcompensation
    or under compensation of the carrier frequency respectively. As a result, there
    is severe degradation in the performance of NPBCH detection, which may introduce
    latency greater than the length of CP (Cyclic Prefix) and subsequently leading
    to loss of orthogonality of OFDM symbol lost in the downlink. Hence to improve
    the detection performance device complexity must be increased so that it may do
    hypothesis testing of set of raster offset. Once the NPSS synchronization is achieved
    the device has the knowledge of subframe #9, however, a device has information,
    whether the radio frame is odd or even numbered. As NBIoT has 504 Cell-ids, thus
    NSSS detection algorithm will form 4032 hypothesis in total. Thereafter correlating
    the received signal corresponding to each hypothesis with NSSS waveform allow
    a device to detect the Cell-id. Hereafter device has Cell-id and also has information
    about the placement of NRS. Now the NBPCH is demodulated to obtain MIB-NB for
    this the device needs to form eight hypotheses hence also referred as blind decoding.
    The MIB-NB contains 34 bits and is transmitted over 64 radio frames. The foremost
    information acquired from MIB are a) Operation mode indicated by 7 bits i.e. stand-alone,
    in-band, guard-band. b) Information about SIB1 scheduling indicated by 4 bits.
    c) SI value tag indicated by 5 bits d) Access barring (AB) information enabled
    or not is indicated by 1 bit. e) System Timing: 4 MSBs of the SFN and 2 LSBs of
    the H-SFN. f) 11 spare bits used for future extensions. In addition to this, the
    transport block size and the number of repetitions is also indicated in the MIB.
    Hence acquiring the MIB-NB, a device can locate and decode SIB1-NB. An SIB1-NB
    carries 8 MSBs of the H-SFN, tracking area, a 28-bit long cell-id, and scheduling
    information regarding other SIB to unambiguously ascertain a cell within a PLMN.
    The SIB1-NB transmitted in subframe #4 of every other frame in 16 continuous frames.
    Beside this, it is transmitted at a fixed schedule with a periodicity of 2560
    ms (256 Radio Frames). To determine the first frame for transmission of SIB1,
    cell-id is used. Hereafter acquiring SIB1-NB, the device achieves the complete
    synchronization. If any change occurs it will be indicated either by paging or
    by changing the tag values. In a manner, the device has accomplished time and
    frequency synchronization with errors that will not significantly degrade the
    performance in successive transmissions and receptions during connected or idle
    mode operations [65], [66]. Fig. 11 (a) describes the cell acquisition process.
    FIGURE 11. (a) Cell acquisition process [66]. (b) Random access procedure [69].
    (c) Connection Establishment [70]. (d) Data transmission [73]. Show All 2) Random
    Access Procedure Random Access procedure is initiated by the MAC layer itself
    or by its sublayer RRC. Before initialization of this process, UE has information
    about the available set of PRACH resources. The principles to select PRACH resource
    is based on received signal received power (RSRP) measurement that specify the
    enhanced coverage level supported by the Serving Cell. A device uses two threshold
    values supported by serving cell to determine the NPRACH configuration. Besides
    this, the RSRP thresholds are used by the network to analyze the maximum coupling
    loss corresponding to different coverage levels. In NBIoT the eNB can support
    max 3 number of NPRACH repetitions out of {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64}. Hereafter
    acquiring the CE level information UE instructs the physical layer to transmit
    a preamble while specifying the number of repetitions required for transmission
    per preamble, preamble index and preamble received target power. For CE level
    0, the preamble received target power (PRTP) is set to PRTP-10 * log10 (number-of-Repetition-Per-Preamble-Attempt)
    whereas for other CE levels PRTP is set to the UE maximum output power [67], [68].
    In NPRACH, RA preamble is transmitted to determine the transmission time of the
    device to eNodeB. On each symbol group of RA preamble frequency hopping is applied
    so that individual group is transmitted on a different subcarrier. Hereafter transmitting
    the preamble, RA-RNTI (Random Access-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) is computed
    using RA-RNTI = 1+floor (SFN_id/4), here SFN_id is the index of the first radio
    frame, then it looks for RAR (Random Access Response) message indicated in DCI
    format N1 scrambled with RA-RNTI transmitted in PDCCH. Nevertheless, if RAR (random
    Access Response) is not received then UE retransmits the preamble. As stated above
    number of retransmissions depend on CE level. However, if the number of attempt
    saturates an associated failure is reported to RRC. Now eNB on receiving the preamble
    sequence transmits the RAR message also referred as Msg 2, to UE which provide
    information about TA (Timing Advance), scheduling information about radio resource
    that device can use to transmit the request for connection, C-RNTI (Cell radius
    Network Temporary identification) as shown in Fig. 11 (b) [69] Now UE transmits
    Msg 3 to eNB on NPUSCH including its identity, C-RNTI MAC CE, submitted from the
    upper layer and start the contention resolution process. In addition to this data,
    the volume parameter is sent to indicate the amount of data present in UE buffer.
    All together will facilitate the BS to take power allocation and scheduling decision
    for subsequent UL transmission. 3) Connection Establishment UE indicates that
    it wants to connect to the network by sending RRC-Connection-Request. In addition
    to the establishment cause, the UE also indicates its capability to support multi-tone
    traffic and multi carrier support. The eNB on receiving connection request, send
    RRC-Connection-Setup message Thereafter UE acknowledges by sending the Connection-setup-
    -complete message and send NAS attach request. The PDN-CONNECTIVITY-REQUEST message
    is piggy-backed in NAS ATTACH REQUEST [70], [71]. The PDN connection is novel
    capability introduced in 3GPP Rel-13 that allow UE to remain attached without
    PDN connection that support CIoT optimization. In this UE is not required to establish
    a PDN connection as part of attach procedure. Moreover UE and MME can release
    the connection without releasing EPS connection. Hence enables large number of
    devices to keep their connection inactive for long duration and seldom transmit
    data over it [72]. Hereafter the EPS authentication process is initiated. After
    that to activate the default EPS bearer CONTEXT REQUEST message is piggybacked
    in NAS: ATTACH ACCEPT. The follow of above discussed steps are discussed in Fig.
    11(c). 4) Small Data Transfer In Rel-13, 3GPP added an ability to send data over
    control Plane. As NBIoT require to transmit the small data sporadically, hence
    to send it in optimized way CIoT EPS optimizations are used which include Control
    Plane and User Plane optimization. In Control Plane optimization, UE sends the
    data packets encapsulated in NAS (Non Access Stratum) to convey non radio signal
    to MME for a service request. In NAS message RAI (Release Assistance Information)
    field indicate the MME that any further UL/DL transmissions are expected. In case
    no further transmission is expected than MME immediately triggers the S1 Release
    procedure. Hence enable MME to reduce the device DRX waiting period during which
    it waits for additional transmission. Besides this, if the size of the data transferred
    via Control Plane exceeds then UE/MME triggers the establishment of User Plane
    bearer between eNB and SGW. User Plane CIoT EPS optimization is an alternative
    procedure which is suitable for short as well as large data transaction. However,
    it requires first to establish RRC connection and create Access Stratum and radio
    bearer between the network and UE. Once the RRC connection is established two
    control procedures Connection suspend and Resume are used [74] G. Modes of Operation
    of NBIoT NBIoT carrier can be deployed in three modes standalone, in-band, and
    guard band. Standalone Operation: In this mode, a separate spectrum is either
    reserved for radio access technology like GSM/UMTS or a dedicated spectrum is
    used for deployment of NBIoT carrier. However, this will escalate the implementation
    cost as software and hardware upgradation will be required for spectrum reframing.
    In Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier is deployed within LTE carrier.
    Sharing of resource block would definitely result in the more efficient use of
    spectrum which in turn will increase the capacity. The LTE bands not utilized
    to carry system information block −1 are used for inband deployment of NBIoT.
    In single tone transmission mode in uplink, there will be interference between
    NB-IoT and LTE (3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing). Although this interference could
    be minimized by scheduling users with similar SNR requirements in NB-IoT and nearby
    LTE PRBs. It’s also a cost effective way as no hardware modifications are required.
    In Guard Band Operation: In this mode NBIoT carrier will be located within guard
    band of LTE carrier to avoid interference. This mode delivers better downlink
    throughput in comparison to in band as more downlink resource is available [75].
    NB-IoT deployment modes offer high flexibility as carrier deployed in one mode
    can continue working via either of the other modes if spectrum migrates to LTE.
    Fig. 12 describes the scenario of different modes. FIGURE 12. Modes of operation
    of NBIoT [75]. Show All H. Low Power Consumption Using NBIoT Saving power of the
    battery powered device is a crucial factor for the realization of LPWAN applications.
    Two main features Power saving mode (introduced in Rel-12) and Extended Discontinuous
    reception RX (introduced in Rel-13) are used to extend the battery life of device
    up to ten or more years (Fig. 13(A) shows the PSM and Fig. 13(B) eDRX mode) [76].
    FIGURE 13. PSM and eDRX modes to save power, [Source: https://www.rohde-schwarz.comRohde&Schwarz].
    Show All A device in PSM goes into deep sleep mode and could not receive any signal.
    Although whilst this mode device can’t be reached but remain registered with the
    network. Thereby PSM eradicates the need for re-establishment of a connection
    when the device wakes up. Hence will not only result in saving power but also
    help in avoiding network congestion (due to different wake-up time). Thus it is
    suitable for application that requires sporadic transmission (e.g. Once a day).
    A device can switch to PSM, proposing two timers T3324 (active timer) and T3412
    (extended timer) and it is attached to TAU. (The maximum time a device could remain
    in the active state is 186 minutes (~T3324) & max sleeping time for a device would
    be 413 days defined by T3412.) However, it’s up to the network to accept the proposed
    timer values or not. Despite this, there is one challenge of using PSM is non
    reachability of device for a long period that needs to be taken care of by opting
    an optimal value to get a good balance between responsiveness and time for the
    device to stay in PSM. Another main feature is eDRX to save power, this in comparison
    to PSM supports DL accessibility significantly. eDRX reduces the periodicity of
    a device to switch in receiving mode and extends the sleep cycle more in idle
    mode than in connected mode. Currently, in LTE, DRX can extend up to 10.24 s whereas
    using eDRX it can be extended for minutes and hours. Thus for synchronization
    between network and device a new clock H-SFN (Hyper System Frame Number) is used.
    A power saving of 43% can be achieved using eDRX with small paging transmission
    window. As power consumption after PTW during deep sleep mode would be extremely
    low. Hence longer the eDRX more would be power saving. In addition to this other
    feature like reduced complexity and reduced overhead of channel measurement also
    reduce the power consumption, hence extends battery life [77]. I. Applications
    of NBIoT The cost effectiveness of NBIoT-network (due to the implementation of
    new software on an existing LTE infrastructure) has inspired several market analyst
    organizations to predict the revenue in the future. NBIoT being a promising technology,
    could support a wide range of applications with increased efficiency. Some of
    the important applications sectors of NBIoT with notable market perspective are
    utility-meter, industry automation, smart logistics, smart cities, waste management,
    environmental monitoring, agriculture and in personal sector like wearables, pet
    tracking, kids monitoring, white goods monitoring (Fig. 14) which provide convenience
    to remotely access of water, gas, electricity, and heat readings even when they
    are located in weak coverage areas like basements. Currently, a Germany based
    company, ista-International GmBH in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom is proving
    a solution for smart buildings by providing smart utility services using NBIoT
    [26]. Other companies such as Eco Mobile from Zagreb, Croatia in collaboration
    with Deutsche Telekom are providing IoT solutions for waste management using NBIoT.
    Here the sensors are used to measure the level of the trash bin and thereafter
    the sensed data using NBIoT sent to cloud, to determine the optimal route. Hence
    reduce logistic cost. Another important application of NBIoT is smart parking.
    Here occupancy [55]. Prime use case/application of NBIoT is utility meters information
    is collected and hence provide the availability of parking space throughout the
    city. Hamburg will be first to offer using this service of IoT using NBIoT. Huawei
    with China Unicom collaboratively launched smart parking in China also in 2017.
    Apart from this NBIoT can also monitor the environment effectively [16]. For example,
    XMM7115, FIGURE 14. Applications of NBIoT. Show All NBIoT-intel chip is used for
    environmental monitoring. Currently, in Greece Patras, NBIoT based monitoring
    service is being offered by Deutsche Telekom to effectively measure environment
    pollution, noise and air quality to take necessary actions. Automation and digitization
    is the need of the hour and list of possible application are endless. The technical
    view of current IoT applications related to four particular sectors Health monitoring,
    Social monitoring, Agriculture monitoring and defense that are ruling the market
    are given in Table 5. TABLE 5 Different Applications of IoT SECTION V. Efficient
    Resource Allocation Techniques Due to massive connections, IoT system will be
    extremely dense thus the use of efficient resource allocation techniques is of
    vital importance. As incompetent resource allocation will drastically degrade
    the performance of IoT systems. Moreover, there are miscellaneous factors that
    further aids in increasing the complicacy of efficient resource allocation such
    as limited network bandwidth, limited device computation power, diverse user requirement,
    heterogeneous device configurations. Broadly these resource allocation techniques
    can be classified into the following categories: Power allocation, Spectrum allocation,
    Computing & Storage resources allocation in the cloud and Scheduling based (Fig.
    15). Other than this all techniques that assure the reduction in latency and packet
    error are categorized under QoS resource allocation techniques. As per now, few
    resource allocation schemes (RAS) have been proposed for NBIoT system. Immense
    research is required to be carried out for the practical implication of NBIoT
    as the IoT devices have limited resources. In this section, a review of resource
    allocation schemes for NBIoT and IoT system is presented. FIGURE 15. Resource
    allocation in IoT [107]. Show All A. NBIoT Resource Allocation Techniques Yu et
    al. [108] proposed a UL link adaptation scheme with consideration of repletion
    factor to address two important aspects of throughput and reliability. This scheme
    worked in two loops inner and outer. The inner one modifies the repletion factor
    to improve block error ratio whereas outer concentrate on the selection of modulation
    and coding scheme level In addition to this outer loop also decides the repetition
    factor accounting acknowledgment or no acknowledgment packets. As a result, the
    authors observed that the proposed technique can save 46% more resource allocation
    and active time in comparison of straightforward techniques. However, they have
    not considered the effect of inter-channel interference during evaluation. In
    order to handle massive connection effectively in NBIoT multi PRB design is used.
    Where most of UE’s use Anchor-PRB (that satisfy the channel raster condition)
    to get paging and system information block. This leads to overloading of anchor-PRB.
    Hence the overloading of narrowband resource leads to underutilization of resources
    and increase power consumption. To overcome this issue Liu et al. [109] suggested
    a resource allocation technique to balance the paging load by using non-Anchor
    PRB. In the proposed technique existing user will use the Anchor PRB and the new
    NBIoT user will make use of non-Anchor PRB for paging in idle mode. As a result,
    it was observed that resource utilization improved by 30% and power consumption
    was reduced by 80%. Malik et al. [110] proposed an interference aware RAS that
    accounts for the repetition number & time offset. The linear modulation scheme
    is used in NBIoT (QPSK), therefore spectral efficiency is low. Firstly they evaluated
    the max attainable data rate for downlink is 89.2 kbps and 92kbps for uplink (theoretically).
    In addition to this, the authors analyzed the performance of cooperative scheme
    in comparison of non-cooperative and optimal scheme. They found that cooperative
    scheme can reduce the energy consumption by 17% and can improve the data rate
    up to 8%. B. IoT Based Resource Allocation Techniques Liu and Ansari [111] proposed
    a green approach by developing an overlay based architecture that uses relay BS
    powered by solar energy. These relay BS stores the harvested energy in two batteries
    and each one is used in alternatively when one exhaust. Thus omits the grid based
    energy utilization and cuts cost for transmission of power also. Here in this
    approach, the SD (source destination) pairs are classified into two groups based
    on CSI. Where one is direct D2D which doesn’t use relay for transmission and another
    one that uses relay BS for transmission of information. However, while allocating
    bandwidth direct D2D pair is given more preference in comparison to relay based
    D2D transmissions. As a result, authors observed that as the number of SD pair
    increases with D2D communication very less bandwidth left for relay based pairs
    which deteriorates their performance. In addition to this due to large no of direct
    D2D pairs green energy will exhaust quickly and to balance the leftover/residual
    energy the relay BSs with enough left over green energy will transmit their electricity
    via electric transmission lines to the relay BSs which run out of green energy.
    Hence proposed architecture maximizes the green energy utilization and further
    saves the on-grid energy. Further, Kotagi et al. [112] proposed a breathing technique
    to reduce the BS energy consumption by assigning the Tx(Transmission) power efficiently.
    Firstly the SINR of the user is compared with pre-specified SINR threshold value
    and if found greater Tx Power has modified accordingly. Thereupon resource is
    allocated, according to breathing pattern i.e. IoT devices are arranged in increasing
    (inhaling)/decreasing (exhaling) order on the basis required Tx Power and then
    mapped to resource block. In addition to this if available resources are less
    as compare to required, the user/device with a heavy request and highest Tx power
    was blocked. Apart from this transmission power is reduced if SINR of device is
    greater than the threshold value, which in turn improves the co-channel interference.
    Authors found that overall energy consumption of BS reduced and throughput is
    improved using the proposed approach. Further Samie et al. [113] enlighten the
    issue of underutilization of bandwidth of gateway. As IoT device have limited
    computation capability thus it is offloaded to the edge nodes i.e. gateway. However,
    due to limited bandwidth and diverse offloading levels, gateway bandwidth resource
    remain underutilized. Hence authors developed an algorithm that allocates or take
    away bandwidth from a device depending on its battery level. As a result, they
    found that battery life extended by 1.5 hour max and bandwidth utilization improved
    by 40%. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [114] proposed a framework for C-5GN. In the proposed
    framework, multiband sensing approach is used such that sensing is done in shared
    mode where each node is required to sense equal and reduced number of channels,
    thus reduced energy consumption. Although it is assured that all channels get
    processed once at least by a node. Apart from this, a game based CLRS (Cross Layer
    Reconfiguration) scheme is used to satisfy the diverse QoS requirement (latency,
    data rate, etc.) for each node. Hence, authors observed that the proposed technique
    reduced energy consumed during spectrum sensing and QoS is offered economically.
    Pang et al. [115] proposed a complete contention resolution approach based on
    the principle of context-aware and dynamic allocation of resource (CADRA). Overload
    scenario is first detected by analyzing the no of nonempty preambles. If detected,
    CADRA is called. This works in two phases firstly it determines the estimated
    number of RACH attempts by observing the preambles received successfully and empty
    preambles. After that in the second phase resource allocation is done. As a result,
    authors observed that throughput increased with moderate packet delay. Jang et
    al. [116] proposed Non orthogonal resource allocation collaborated with spatial
    group resource allocation scheme (SGRA). SGRA divides the cell into spatial groups.
    After dividing the cell region, it detects the preambles transmitted from the
    user in a certain spatial group by zadoff-chu sequence (which is shifted by spatial
    group number). Once the preambles utilized by a spatial group was determined using
    the ordered time delay metric, subgroups were formed. Authors found that using
    the proposed approach the probability of success of random access has increased
    a lot. Further, Morvari and Ghasemi [117] proposed a resource allocation scheme
    that works in two stage by efficacious use of resource available in UL. During
    the first phase, users are required to pass the access class bearing test. If
    a user manages to pass only then permitted to select the preamble (PA) and use
    physical uplink shared channel opportunity else has to select the special PA.
    Finally, in the second stage the secondary users are allowed to take access class
    bearing test again if passed allowed to request for UL shared channel. Hence it
    is inferred that the number of request that can be handled with proposed technique
    whilst dropping the wastage that occurs due to the collision of PA’s. Another
    extended RA scheme with spatial group resource allocation is proposed in [118].
    This scheme reuses the allocated preamble if the distance between the two nodes
    belonging to a different spatial group is greater than pre-specified minimum distance.
    In addition to this, access delay is also reduced. The proposed approach will
    utilize the unused bandwidth. Beside this collision probability is also tapered
    by using distinct UL resources for transmission. As interference is also a prevalent
    challenge for IoT device communication. Taking into consideration Iqbal et al.
    [119] proposed a constraint specific approach to improve the performance of IoT
    networks For solving the RA problem authors have used backtracking search algorithm
    named Soft-GORA.Where firstly channel is selected with minimum cost for tentative
    allocation to link, at the top in the ordered list and then checked against hard
    constraint. If it couldn’t satisfy the constraint, the allocated channel is removed
    and the next best option is opted. As a result, authors relaxing few constraints
    observed that throughput has improved and delay is reduced. Li et al. [120] proposed
    an architecture using edge computing further, they proposed a scheme to jointly
    control admission of new packet and allocation of resource together with power
    control. For this, the resource management controller at fog node uses three information
    i.e. service, state of the queue, CSI. Using the proposed schemes authors found
    that tradeoff is achieved between throughput and delay. Zhang et al. [121] proposed
    a joint optimize framework for the selection and allocation of resource among
    fog nodes (FN), data service subscribers (DSS) & data service operators.(DSO)
    They have developed a stakelberg game algorithm, here DSO provides the computing
    resources (CR) to DSS and if they require more CRB’s(Computing Resource Block)
    DSS competes for them. For this, another matching game algorithm is developed.
    As a result it was found that the system achieves high performance and optimally
    utilizes their resources. Further, cognitive 5G network (C-5GN) is expected to
    play a vital role in IoT success, Angelakis et al. [122] developed two algorithms
    RAND-INT and Average-cost allocation, to optimally allocate resources for services.
    These algorithms reduced the total cost of resource utilization and activation
    of interface. Where RAND-INT algorithm normalizes the demands to get an order
    in which resource is to be allocated. Henceforth the heaviest demand is served
    first by comparing the utilization cost of interfaces, thereby other demands are
    served either by splitting or by not splitting among two or more interfaces. Whereas
    the second algorithm assigns, the resource by averaging the total cost incurred.
    Authors have studied the impact of the activation cost on the services’ splits
    and distribution among the interfaces. As a result, they found that for random
    service with high demand, interface total cost increases linearly with respect
    to the number of services. Hence above discussed technique proves that resource
    technique can enhance communication, connectivity and collaboration of IoT devices.
    The chief objective of resource allocation technique is to minimize the power
    consumption per node, BER, Delay and maximize the throughput and network utilization.
    The above discussed techniques are summarized in Table 6. TABLE 6 Efficient Resource
    Allocation Techniques for IoT SECTION VI. Energy Consumption in Lifecycle of IoT
    Devices Sensing device act as the backbone for IoT applications. Different sensors
    are deployed massively to develop a ubiquitous sensed environment, to offer diverse
    monitoring and control services. Indeed to avoid service interruptions of critical
    applications sensing device must operate permissibly for a long time. However,
    as most of the IoT devices are powered by constrained energy source hence device
    lifetime longevity is a critical issue. Therefore the device must be monitored
    precisely for optimal utilization. In this context, the trend of energy consumption
    during different states of the sensor is studied in [123]. There are five modes
    among which sensor switches- Mode I: Wake up from Sleep mode, Mode II: After Sleep
    mode. Mode III: Sensing, Mode IV: Processing, Mode V: Transmission. Hussain [123]
    studied different case studies to see the trend of energy consumption during different
    modes. As a conclusion of various trends (Fig. 16), it was found that during Processing-Phase
    energy consumption was least whereas, for Sensing Phase, node consumes the highest
    power as compare to Transmission Phase. However, energy consumption during Transmission
    phase depends on the application. For example, consider the applications like
    Humidity/thermal measurement the power consumption during the wake-up and in getting
    ready for sensing phase is more as compare to other applications like temperature
    sensing which require less power for the same. Duty Cycle is the other metric
    that affects the energy consumption in the sensor node. As the duty cycle increases,
    energy consumption increases consequently lifetime of the node decreases. There
    are various factors that affect the lifetime of an IoT device such as duty cycle,
    the amount of data to be communicated, processing time other factors like aging,
    self-discharge and temperature [124]. Hence various energy efficiency techniques
    have been proposed in the literature to improve the lifetime of an IoT device
    and hence network lifetime. In the next section the recently proposed energy efficiency
    techniques are discussed in detail. FIGURE 16. Energy consumption during the lifecycle
    of IoT device [123]. Show All A. Energy Efficient Techniques for Green Communication
    The energy budget affects the sensor node processing time, quality of measurement
    and amount of data it can transmit, thus energy efficiency techniques can a play
    crucial role to improve QoE. Rault et al. [125] classified the energy efficiency
    techniques classified into five categories of radio optimization, data reduction,
    sleep/wakeup schemes, energy efficient routing and battery repletion. Where radio
    optimization techniques would optimize modulation schemes, transmission power,
    and antenna direction on the other hand data reduction reduces the data transmitted.
    Furthermore Sleep/Wake-up adaptively switches the node to sleep or active mode
    to save energy. Other two techniques, energy efficient routing, and battery repletion
    works on routing efficiency and ways of harvesting energy or finding ways to charge
    battery automation, respectively. (Fig. 17, discusses briefly the impact of different
    techniques). In this section, the existing literature on energy efficiency techniques
    is discussed. FIGURE 17. Classification of energy efficiency techniques for IoT.
    Show All 1) Sleep/Wakeup Techniques Khodr et al. [126] enlighten that though the
    duty cycling technique could reduce power consumption but this will reduce network
    reactivity. Thus authors proposed a design of sensor based RF wake up technology.
    This design approach wakes the sensor only when the address decoder detects that
    whether a received signal address is of IoT device or not. Thereby omits the fake
    call wakeups hence reduced energy consumption. Perles et al. [127] did a case
    study on cultural heritage and proposed an architecture to improve the lifespan
    of sensor life up to 20 years using unlicensed LPWAN technologies LoRa &SigFox.
    In order to keep the energy consumption low, the proposed architecture wakes up
    the microcontroller whenever a new packet arrives. Apart from this, it uses a
    cluster management system, Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) which can deploy
    and un-deploy nodes as per demand i.e. nodes will be deployed if load increases
    and un-deployed if they are idle. 2) Cognitive Radio Techniques Further, Qureshi
    et al. [128] discussed cognitive radio approach where unlicensed users opportunistically
    access the unused spectrum holes that are not used by the licensed user. Hence
    to achieve good throughput, uninterrupted connectivity, and Reliable communication,
    for both licensed and unlicensed user the concept of the backup data channel (BDC)
    was introduced. Where if licensed user return than unlicensed user resumes its
    communication using BDC. Hence communication time between SUs for task completion
    will be reduced and thereby the energy consumption of CRAN’s will reduce and throughput
    will increase. Furthermore, Li et al. [129] proposed a 5G based framework where
    the central control unit act as both cloud and central data processor takes the
    sensed data from the physical world. In addition to this authors, fractionated
    the resource allocation into two sub problems of power and channel allotment in
    industrial Cyber physical IoT. These sub-problems are solved separately. For individual
    channel allotment, the energy efficiency is achieved using game theory and Dinkelbach’s
    algorithm. After this, the Hungarian method was used for channel allocation. Authors
    analyzed that IHM-VD could perform outstandingly. 3) Routing Techniques Further
    Yi et al. [130] proposed a topology control algorithm in which nodes discover
    their neighbors asymmetrically. For time synchronization multiple of two is taken
    as reference point. Authors observed that energy consumption got abridged due
    to curtailment in wakeup calls required to discover the neighboring node. Further,
    the utmost drawback of continuous sensing (i.e. nonselective monitoring) is unfiltered
    data that results in significant energy consumption of sensors. Basnayaka and
    Haas [131] proposed a physical layer modulation scheme RNM (random number modulation)
    that operates in two modes energy efficient and low latency. To switch between
    modes the constellation order and random bit generated by random generator were
    considered. Proposed approach compromise latency for energy efficiency, as the
    user was allowed to transmit the data block only when it matches with random sequence
    generated by a random number generator otherwise the user could not transmit the
    data. Shen et al. [132] proposed a clustering based protocol EECRP for IoT assisted
    by WSN to enhance the performance of the network. Firstly a cluster head is opted
    by comparing the energy of each node with pre-specified energy (threshold value)
    after this taking the distance from the centroid (energy based) of the network
    to the node is considered. This leads to uniform energy consumption in the network.
    After this for optimal result, the max distance value is broadcasted by BS to
    all the nodes, in order to avoid long distance communication. As a result, it
    has been found that overall energy consumption of the network is reduced in comparison
    to proprietary protocols. In extension to this, Tian et al. [133] have discussed,
    when to use network coding concept to reduce the energy consumption. Authors have
    proposed a network coding and power control based routing (NCPCR) protocol. Using
    this protocol intermediate node drops the duplicate packets and keep the relevant
    information in its buffer. Source node selects the path with the minimum distance
    to transmit the data packets. As a result the energy consumption is reduced as
    no of packets to be retransmitted is reduced and moreover, it opts for the shortest
    path also and in addition to this, it can handle scalability. 4) Data Reduction
    Technique Perera et al. [134] proposed a platform C-MOSDEN that performs sensing
    tasks collaboratively and in a selective manner i.e. adaptive sensing to reduce
    energy consumption. As sensing would require less computational efforts to drive
    knowledge from data generated. In addition to this, the storage cost will also
    be reduced. 5) Battery Repletion Technique Nan et al. [135] enlighten that offloading
    the traffic at fog layer or edge layer has led to increased carbon footprints,
    thus they have proposed an online algorithm LOTEC (Lyapunov optimization on time
    and energy cost). The proposed technique suggested using green power source i.e.
    solar energy and grid power as a standby power source. The discussed energy efficiency
    techniques are summarized in tabular form in Table 7. In this paper, two novel
    application based energy efficient approaches are proposed. For smart agriculture
    and Smart Healthcare. Where “ZTPA” -a hybrid approach, centered on two techniques
    “Sleep/wake up” and “Energy efficient routing” is proposed. E2AHMS is proposed
    for smart healthcare, which is a radio based approach. These two approaches with
    their proposed mathematical approach are discussed in detail in section VIII.
    TABLE 7 Energy Effeciency Techniques for IoT SECTION VII. Open Issues Ascertaining
    the vision of the NBIoT is not a tranquil task, owing to multiple challenges that
    are required to be addressed Although NBIoT offers significant features for LPWA
    applications, yet a number of critical issues remain unattended that seeks traction
    from the research community. The technical issues and challenges related to energy
    are discussed in this section. A. Non-Uniformity in Resources Allocation In the
    current scenario, resources are allocated on the basis of total available power,
    coverage range, and demanded applications. Due to non-uniformity in the requirement
    of resources, a non-uniformity in power consumption persists. This is a critical
    challenge that seeks redressal as there are no studies/algorithms/techniques available
    for uniform resource allocation in NBIoT. A unified platform is required for resource
    allocation so that applications can be handled adaptively in real time scenarios.
    B. Difficulty in Achieving the Desired Throughput The prime advantage of NBIoT
    enabled device is to make use of low power to operate. Therefore the power of
    the signal transmitted will be low. Beside this due to channel losses, fading
    & interference (Intra/Inter) SINR will drop drastically. Hence it would be quite
    difficult to achieve the desired throughput in all condition. Thus proper channel
    modeling, optimized algorithms/techniques required to be designed/developed to
    achieve desired throughput C. Inter-Channel Interference The allocation of frequency
    in in-band or standalone mode will not be synchronous among all the cells in the
    network. This results in interference among neighboring cells. Interference within
    the same cell also exists due to the deployment of small cells in the macro cell.
    These result in a fall in the SNR. This is a decisive challenge, especially for
    critical applications like acute healthcare applications, where noise could tamper
    biological readings. This may lead to the wrong detection and thereby wrong medication.
    Thus an efficient scheme is required to be developed to reduce interference and
    provide QoS to the users. D. Spectral Efficiency To achieve extended coverage,
    the concept of multiple repetitions is utilized. Undoubtedly this would improve
    the Tx Reliability but will lead to loss of spectral efficiency. Thus an efficient
    resource allocation scheme is required which could optimally decide the repetition
    factor. Furthermore, to maintain high channel capacity- device consumes more power,
    consequently reducing its lifetime. This open issue needs to be addressed because
    it would adversely affect the battery lifetime E. Latency Different types of latency
    can occur during NBIoT communication: a) UL/DL latency, b) synchronization latency,
    c) the latency associated with resource allocation, d) latency associated with
    packet synchronization. Though NBIoT applications are delay tolerant, yet latency
    needs to be kept below 10s, especially for real time applications such as health
    monitoring. Thus the theoretical computational model must be framed to improve
    the latency analysis. F. Synchronization With the Access Point Consider a scenario
    where utility meters are positioned close to each other. When all devices would
    send information to the cluster head, synchronization will be difficult for the
    access point as there would be interference between devices within its range.
    Besides this, other factors like the priority of a device, its residual power
    availability and channel conditions will also affect the synchronization process,
    raising its complexity. Hence this open issue needs to be addressed by providing
    techniques/algorithms for synchronization. G. Security The issue of security is
    very critical for NBIoT. As low power devices have limited resources, they are
    more vulnerable to security attacks. By exploiting the data integrity or tracking
    the traffic pattern, passive or active attack can befall at the perception layer.
    Besides, other security attacks such as the injection of false data by an intruder,
    transmission of interference signals, etc. can also occur. Thus continuous efforts
    must be put in by industry, academicians, and researchers to maintain the faith
    of users in using the services provided by the NBIoT application. H. Carbon Footprint
    Inflation The massive connectivity among millions of devices would generate an
    enormous amount of data. In order to draw an inference from the collected information,
    servers need to manage data through extensive computations. This will overburden
    the servers, resulting in rising in energy and subsequently raising carbon emissions.
    In addition, the factors such as manufacturing of billions of IoT devices, shipments
    of these devices, excess use of radio access network, etc. will also elevate the
    carbon footprint. Fig. 18 demonstrates the percentage of carbon emissions due
    to various such activities [136]. Collaboratively, these will have an adverse
    impact on pollution levels. Hence, the need for a generic architecture arises
    to achieve Green IoT, whilst assuring better QoS to all the users. FIGURE 18.
    Carbon footprint due to various activities. Show All I. E-Waste Management As
    technology improves, people started procuring additional electronic equipment’s
    like PDA’s, desktop computers, smart phones, and gadgets, though might not be
    required. The complex structure of these e-waste/WEEE (waste electrical and electronic
    equipment) makes it difficult to destroy. The condition will become even more
    severe in coming future when millions of sensors and battery operated IoT devices
    will have to be destroyed and replaced with new ones, either due to reformation
    in technology or lifetime expiry. Many countries like Japan, Taiwan, and U.S etc.
    are working on this hot burning issue since 2001. However, together with this
    research efforts are needed for the development of the green disposable electronic
    device. J. Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) Overhead In C-RAN the virtual centralized
    BBU (Base Band Unit) is used to reduce the OPEX, generated heat, and latency.
    Hence, instead of having BBU at each cell site with remote Radio head, they are
    repositioned in centralized manner in BBU home. In IoT, the users would be monitoring
    & controlling multiple devices remotely, this would overburden the existing network
    especially between the RRH and BBU Pool. Moreover, the different types of data
    i.e. real, non-real, social, sensitive, medical/health data, agriculture related
    data, etc. would collectively create an extensive overhead for CRAN. Pertaining
    to this, a huge number of processing units would be required to process the enormous
    IoT data. This, in turn, generates massive power requirement. Hence “prioritization
    of data” could be one of the solutions to deal with this open issue. K. Interface
    With Next Generation Like 5G Network The journey of IoT from virtual ideology
    to real time implementation has many milestones to achieve and one of those is
    interoperability among IoT devices. As we know that 5G operates on the very high
    frequency range like millimeter waves frequency, ranging from 28 to 32 GHz, whilst
    IoT devices operate at 2.2 GHz. Thus it’s a big challenge for the researchers
    to interface IoT with 5G Other than this, the high operating frequency in 5G networks
    escalates power consumption levels to achieve the data rate of the order of Gbps.
    In contrast to this IoT devices are highly power constrained thus operate at low
    power levels. This requires technological developments. Including this various
    other challenges such as [137] Cooperation among millions of devices, Heterogeneous
    subnet, Anonymous device configuration and Conflicts among semantics of devices
    exist. All these will collectively urge for research efforts before 5G specifications
    are standardized. L. MIMO/Massive MIMO Undoubtedly, Multiple Input Multiple Output
    (MIMO) technique provide a high data rate with high Reliability. In MIMO BS is
    acquainted with multiple antennas to improve the spectral & energy efficiency.
    Although, MIMO is an enabler for 5G, yet, it is difficult to employ MIMO in IoT.
    It is because, in the multi antenna scenario, information transmissions from the
    sensor nodes will require more processing during the synchronization phase. This
    results in more power consumption at the sensor end. Since the sensor nodes have
    limited battery capacity, adaptability of IoT devices in a MIMO environment is
    an open challenge that needs to be addressed. M. Channel State Information Collection
    Overhead The channel state assessment overhead intensifies linearly with a number
    of users. If the number of users grows beyond the threshold value then channel
    block could no longer support the assessment overhead within the narrow coherence
    time, especially for IoT applications. Moreover, the inaccurate channel estimation
    results in unreliable transmission. This uncertainty is due to the staleness of
    information after a certain time gap, due to the collision of pilot signals in
    UL. Pertaining to this, contention and interference would aggravate. As a result,
    more retransmissions are required which upraise the power consumption of IoT devices.
    Moreover, multiple verifications will contribute to more power consumption. SECTION
    VIII. Proposed Architecture Towards Green Communication Using NBIoT The world
    population is expected to grow up to 8.025 billion by 2030. Consequently, this
    growth will inflate the global food demand. Thus meeting the demands of the immense
    population will be a tough task. The varying climatic conditions, scarcity of
    water, etc. shall further aggravate the circumstances In addition to this, enhanced
    health assistance will also be required for projected population, which will be
    quite difficult to handle using existing infrastructure and services. Thus integration
    of IoT with Agriculture & Health sector can ensure a resourceful and healthy life
    for an individual. Despite, all this revolution that IoT is capable to bring in,
    the biggest stumbling block of its success is to provide energy efficient solution.
    As most of the IoT devices are constrained in term of energy. Hence this paper
    is proposing energy efficiency techniques for two prime applications: Smart Agriculture:
    Zonal Thermal Pattern Analysis and Smart Health: Energy Efficiency Adaptive Health
    Monitoring System.NBIoT is used for both the application as it offers favorable
    features like extended coverage with deep indoor penetration, long battery life,
    supports high density, require the low-cost device, and provide end to end security.
    Moreover, it would not require the deployment of new infrastructure as compared
    to proprietary technologies LoRa and SigFox, hence would offer a cost effective
    solution. A. Proposed Technique for Smart Agriculture: ZTPA 1) Case Study 1: Energy
    Efficient Agriculture Monitoring, Irrigation System for Green Communication The
    growing population and climate vagaries are forestalling that in future decades
    water resources would reduce eminently, especially for agriculture. Since agriculture
    practices require an ample amount of water, effective utilization of water is
    an obvious issue to be addressed. This section investigates an energy efficient
    technique for productive utilization of water. It has been put forth to overcome
    the disadvantages of conventional irrigation systems like wastage of water (due
    to percolation, evaporation), abbreviated crop yield. To economize the use of
    water in agriculture, IoT with Deep Learning could play a significant role. In
    the proposed scenario, soil moisture sensors are deployed in the farm field under
    consideration. Thereafter data aggregated from multiple sensors will be passed
    on to the BS using NBIoT and then to the NBIoT cloud. At the cloud, data (moisture)
    will be processed using Deep Learning and subsequently, the farm field will be
    adaptively divided into zones based on moisture level, as shown in Fig. 19 (for
    one iteration which is subjected to change in other iterations). Hereafter depending
    on the moisture levels i.e. moderate moisture level, high moisture level and least
    moisture level, zones will be irrigated. To accomplish this, the water pump is
    attached with smart NBIoT enabled water control device. This device would transmit
    the water in desired quantity and for the desired time in the zones. This scenario
    could be well understood by Fig. 19 where zone Z2 with dark pink color has the
    highest moisture, Z1 has the least moisture and Z3 has moderate moisture level.
    As Z2 has good moisture level so no water would be transmitted in that zone. Hence,
    sensor nodes in Z2 will enter idle state followed by the sleep state for a long
    period of time by exploiting eDRX in NBIoT. This will save water along with energy.
    In addition to this UL traffic will also be reduced, thereby reducing the congestion
    impact also. FIGURE 19. Proposed architecture for energy efficient precision agriculture
    using NBIoT–toward green communication. Show All There is another aspect to be
    considered while designing this scenario i.e. land orientation. Hence this use
    case study is divided into two sub problems: a: Uniform Land Surface When land
    has uniform orientation like in the plain area, there will be no water logging
    problem. Therefore, farm/agriculture land can be irrigated by classifying the
    moisture data as discussed previously. Thus watering of the field by the proposed
    pioneered way could avoid the wastage of water. Also in the plain area, the orientation
    of land is more or less uniform, thus the pattern of power consumption would not
    be much diverse. This can be depicted by thermal pattern analysis using drones
    and satellite captured thermal images. b: Non-Uniform Land Surface Another case
    is when agriculture land has non-uniform orientation like in hilly areas, which
    leads to the uneven power consumption of devices. As in some case, eNB will allocate
    the resource to the sensor via NBIoT using direct path whereas in some cases using
    an indirect path. In our proposed approach we have not only considered direct/indirect
    resource allocation but in addition to this, the overlap condition will also be
    considered, where one region overlaps with another region. As shown in Fig. 20
    regions R1 and R2, describes the overlap region. Here the sensor S3, S5, S9, S21,
    S14 suffers from Inter-Interference. FIGURE 20. Proposed architecture for energy
    efficient precision agriculture using NBIoT based on thermal pattern analysis
    (TPA). Show All Hence the power consumption pattern will be diverse for node present
    in this region and node present outside of this region which in turn would affect
    the network lifetime. In addition to this SNR will also get influenced by interference
    within inter-interference region. 2) Mathematical Analysis for Energy Efficient
    Smart Agriculture Sensor nodes SN 1 , SN 2 , SN 3 ,……., SN n are deployed in the
    field and as per proposed model, it is assumed CH of disjoint sets of sensors
    (CH1, CH2, and CH3) will communicate with the processing unit (PU). Further, this
    PU would communicate with BS. Assume that using NBIoT technology k PRB’s (physical
    resource blocks) are required. As the signal propagates from SN i to NBIoT node
    path loss (PL) will occur. PL will depend on the position of sensor. If the sensor
    is placed under the soil or underground, then soil would absorb the signal and
    hence leads to path loss which can be evaluated as follows P ∗ C = P real C −j(
    P dipolarloss + σ 2πf P D ) (3) View Source Here P ∗ C specifies the complex-permittivity
    (cp), P real C denotes the real part of cp, P dipolarloss is due to Relaxation
    and P D specifies the relative dielectric-permittivity [138], [139]. The permittivity
    of soil can be affected importantly by parameters like water content, frequency
    of signal, soil composition and soil conductivity. Hence it is difficult to measure
    the soil permittivity accurately. Path loss can be calculated using equation (4)
    where T p is Transmission power, T g Transmission gain, R g receiver gain, PL
    fs is path loss due to free space propagation of signal and PL M is path loss
    due to medium, α is path loss between NBIoT node and eNB.1 PL= T p + T g + R g
    + PL fs − PL M +α (4) View Source Further path loss due to medium can be evaluated
    as follows [139] PL M = WD s + TL s (5) View Source Where WD s is path loss due
    to difference in wavelength of signal in soil in comparison of free space and
    TL s is transmission loss. If the sensor is placed above the surface (of ground),
    then plants would act as scatterers and thereby the path loss can be evaluated
    using equation (6) PL(d)=PL( d 0 )+10mlog( d d 0 )+ OH T i +α (6) View Source
    Here OH T i represent the obstacle height at time iε {1, 2, 3}, where i=1 specifies
    the phase, when seeds are just sawn, so no plant would be there at that time so
    no obstacle. Likewise for i=2 , specifies that plant has started budding up so
    it will have certain height. Similarly for i=3 specifies, plant has fully grown
    to its full height. Thus corresponding to height of plant, obstacle path loss
    parameter would increase. Here d 0 specifies the reference distance between sensing
    node and NBIoT node (Refer Fig. 20.). Here α specifies the path loss between NBIoT
    node and eNB. Hence the SINR of the sensing node can be expressed as SINR= S T
    G k N+ I T (7) View Source Where N is thermal noise, I T total interference, S
    T represents the transmitted signal power and G k is the channel gain between
    sensor node k and NBIoT node. We then express the total interference as I T =
    I interzone + I intrazone + I Soilreflectivity (8) View Source Interference that
    occurs within zone, between zones and also due to soil reflectivity. Further channel
    capacity (C) can be evaluated based on Shannon theorem as follows C= Blog 2 (1+
    S k G k N+ I T ) (9) View Source Based on these above formulations we conclude
    that capacity of a sensor deployed in the agricultural area will be adversely
    affected by the interference generated by the adjacent sensor nodes, scatterers,
    etc. a: Energy Consumption Evaluation For electing cluster head out of n sensor
    node for each disjoint set of sensing nodes. Each node power level is to be determined
    and one with highest power level is selected. Power level get deteriorates due
    to energy dissipation. Hence we first evaluate the total energy consumed due to
    various factors for each node (The energy model used here is given [140].) E C
    Total =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching
    (10) View Source Where energy consumption during sensing could be evaluated using
    equation (11) EC Sensing = EC Sample ∗n (11) View Source Here EC Sample specifies
    the energy consumption during sampling of each sample, n represents the no of
    samples. Similarly, energy consumption during transmission ( EC Transmission )
    depends on supply voltage S v , current I and time T required for transmission
    EC Transmission = S v ∗I∗T (12) View Source Energy consumed during switching from
    active to sleep state [141] EC Switching = T Swt ∗( PC Active + PC Sleep )/2 (13)
    View Source Hence total energy consumption can be evaluated (using eq. 10) and
    using Relation E= P*T, power levels can be evaluated for each node, where T will
    include time for switching, sleeping, active, sensing, and processing. Hence CH
    can be selected for by comparing the power of all the nodes. Here another aspect
    must also be included that is if the node has acted as CH earlier also then. Hence
    we evaluate the energy consumption when node act as CH, ( EC CH ) . This will
    depend on length of message L MSG and energy consumed by transmitter if sending
    the message to processing point (PP) or energy consumed when receiver receives
    data by PP [142]. EC CH = L MSG ∗ EC TX/RX ∗ D PP (14) View Source Hence total
    energy consumption equation if node acted as CH could be rewritten as E C Total
    =EC Sensing + EC Processing+ EC Transmission + EC Sleeping + EC Switching + EC
    CH (15) View Source Finally energy efficiency EE can be evaluated as ratio of
    total energy consumed ,EC TOTAL and energy of sensor at time of deployment ,E
    TOTAL EE= EC TOTAL / E TOTAL (16) View Source Hence using the proposed approach
    energy efficiency can be improved as EC TOTAL will be reduced by exploiting the
    eDRX of sensing nodes. B. Proposed Technique for Smart Health: E2AHMS 1) Case
    Study: Energy Efficient Health Monitoring System for Green Communication IoT provides
    a big platform to solve medical issues, in real time scenario. Integration of
    IoT with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is gaining much of the momentum and
    currently being used for health monitoring of soldiers at battlefields, patients
    in hospitals, elderly people who could not visit hospitals very often, etc. The
    performance of WBAN (i.e. reliability, delay, power efficiency) chiefly depends
    on the physical and medium access control layer. Moreover, as most of the IoT-BAN
    devices are battery operated, thus power optimization will greatly impact their
    lifetime and performance. In this context, this paper is proposing a novel approach
    namely “Energy Efficient Adaptive Health Monitoring System” E2AHMS. This approach
    will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively distributing the transmission
    power required to monitor the patient. In our proposed Health Monitoring system
    three prospective conditions have been considered Stable, Mono-Stable, Relatively
    mobile (Fig. 21). FIGURE 21. Proposed health monitoring system using NBIoT–toward
    green communication. Show All Case B.1: Stable: When a patient lying on the bed
    i.e. stationary condition Case B.2: Mono-Stable: When a patient is sitting or
    standing. Case B.3: Relatively mobile: When a patient will be moving either by
    walking or using a wheelchair. Our proposed approach E2AHMS can not only be used
    for patients who require continuous monitoring, but also for health monitoring
    of person who are fit but wants to keep track of their health to prevent themselves
    from severe disease. As in both the cases, network life time will play a vital
    role, which can be increased or improved by using proposed optimized energy efficient
    algorithm. E2AHMS will work in an energy efficient manner by adaptively using
    the transmission , power required during different postural mobility (considered
    before). To understand this it is required to first understand the difference
    in energy requirement during different cases under consideration. CASE B.1 (STABLE):
    While sleeping it is very likely that the sensors will have LOS communication.
    Hence, Body Area Network will be in stable state. Thus power required for transmission
    would be least and hence energy required. As path loss would be minimum between
    sensing nodes and NBIoT coordinator node. Thus energy consumed during sleeping
    state E c_s_st i can be given by summation of energy consumption due to factors
    such as: due to switching from one state to another (On, Off, sleep, idle, Active,
    idle) E st_tr i , due to circuit of sensing device E Crkt i , energy consumption
    due to processing of signals E Proc i , energy consumption due to transmission
    of signal E Trans i , due to acting as relay/connecting node for other sensors
    E connecting_node i and due to various delays (queuing, propagation, transmission)
    E Delays i . E c_s_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i (17) View Source CASE B.2 (MONO-STABLE STATE): In this case the
    patient could be in a sitting posture or moving his arms or having food. Hence
    LOS would not be there between sensing nodes. It is very likely that obstacles
    might interfere with the path of signal transmission thus shadowing would lead
    to multipath loss and hence energy consumption will be more during this posture.
    Energy consumption during mono-stable state E c_ms_st i , can be evaluated by
    equation (18) E c_ms_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connecting_node
    i + E Delays i + E obst i (18) View Source Here E obst i specifies the energy
    consumed due to obstacles/shadowing/multipath effect. CASE B.3 (RELATIVELY MOBILE):
    In this state, the patient will be walking or moving with the help of wheel chair
    or might be doing some routine activities. Therefore it is more likely that NLOS
    transmission will occur due to various reasons such as obstacles in the surrounding,
    links between sensors would change rapidly due to body movement, etc. Hence more
    loss of information and thereby more energy consumption. Energy consumption during
    mobile state could be given by equation 19. E c_m_st i = E st_tr i + E Crkt i
    + E Proc i + E Trans i + E connectin_node i + E Delays i +n. E obst i + E relink
    i (19) View Source Here E relink i denotes the energy consumed due to Relinking
    between sensor nodes and gateway. Thus, it is clear from the above discussion
    that due to multipath effect and different channel conditions, different postural
    movement leads to different energy consumption. Therefore in proposed technique
    E2AHMS, depending on postural movement level transmission power will be used adaptively
    which can be determined using graph theory. Whereas conventionally data was transmitted
    with equal power without considering LOS communication is possible or not and
    also channel conditions are good or not. Hence our proposed approach will be an
    energy efficient approach for Health monitoring application. This proposed approach
    is also supported by mathematical formulation. 2) Mathematical Formulation Multiple
    sensors are positioned on the human body I={i1,i2,i3….,in} (20) View Source Here
    each sensor has a coordinate point i1=( x 1 , y 1 ) i2=( x 2 , y 2 ) (21.1) (21.2)
    View Source Path Loss Analysis As the signal propagates through WBAN this gets
    attenuated due to multiple factors such as reflection, diffraction, refraction,
    fading, etc. To analyze path loss in on-body WBAN, IEEE P802.15, 2009 [143] has
    given a path loss model. Using the same as a reference, path loss can be evaluated
    during different postural mobility. Case B.1 (Stable/Sleeping State): PL dB =
    PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 + S dB (22) View Source Here d 0 is reference the distance
    from NBIoT coordinator. S dB , is shadowing factor added to it due to movement
    of body parts. However, in the sleeping state, it would be negligible. Case B.2
    (Mono-Stable/Sitting State): During this state, signal could fade due to various
    obstacle such as table while having food/medicine, legs under the chair or below
    the table. Moreover due to the movement of body parts effect of shadowing would
    be high. Hence path loss would be more in comparison to the sleeping state. PL
    dB = PL d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +( S dB + F 1 + F 2 ) (23) View Source Here F 1
    + F 2 , is addition PL due to factors such as obstacles, interference, surroundings
    Case B.3 (Mobile State): During this state person would be moving from one place
    to another thus link with access point could change very quickly (From one floor
    to another, one room to another, walking, etc.). The signal would attenuate n
    times more in relative mobile state than Sitting/Mono-Stable state. PL dB = PL
    d 0 +10n log 10 d/ d 0 +n( S dB + F 1 + F 2 + F 3 ) (24) View Source Here F 3
    specifies an additional factor of multipath propagation of signal. As PL is difference
    of transmitted power and received power PL= P Tx − P RX (25) View Source Thus
    received power during different case studies can be evaluated as follows: Case
    B.1: P S_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL S_ST dB (26.1) View Source Case B.2: P MS_ST Rx
    (dB)= P Tx − PL MS_ST dB (26.2) View Source Case B.3: P M_ST Rx (dB)= P Tx − PL
    M_ST dB (26.3) View Source In the conventional system, same transmission power
    is used for all the cases whether required or not, but in the proposed technique
    E2AHMS transmission power would be used adaptively depending on postural mobility.
    Hence power will be used in an optimized way. SNR can be evaluated for different
    considered case studies using received power SNR cas e i = RecivedSignal_power
    P cas e i Rx Noise_Power (27) View Source Thereby channel capacity ( C cas e i
    ) for considered cases {i=B.1, B.2, B.3} using Shannon theorem could be evaluated
    for considered case studies as C cas e i =B(1+ SNR cas e i ) (28) View Source
    Hence Energy efficiency can be evaluated using equation EE cas e i = Channe l
    cas e i P cas e i Tx ∗100% (29) View Source It is clear from the above equation
    the high mobility would result in more energy consumption. Hence using the proposed
    technique power will be saved and thereby could enhance the battery lifetime.
    Thus an energy efficient solution. Using the same theme of the proposed approach
    real time hardware implementation is done which is discussed in next section.
    C. Real Time Hardware Implementation for Proposed Work 1) Hardware System Model
    Fig. 22 gives an overview of proposed approach real time implementation. Here
    two axis accelerometer sensors and a pulse sensor is used for real time analysis.
    To determine the patient postural mobility accelerometer sensors are placed on
    his right hand and right leg. Apart from this a pulse sensor is used to measure
    the pulse rate of the patient. Further, in order to send the health information
    to eNB in energy efficient way. Our proposed approach will differentiate between
    different postural (Fig. 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)) using edge computing. Such
    that energy is utilized in an efficiently way by using an optimal amount of transmission
    power of device as suggested in proposed approach to transmit information to eNB.
    Hereafter the health information is forwarded to the centralized cloud and then
    to application server and finally to doctor, who tracks the record of patient,
    to avoid unwanted situation. Finally, doctor would prescribe some medicine if
    required otherwise the message will be sent to user that he is fine. FIGURE 22.
    Real time health monitoring system model. Show All 2) Hardware Requirement 3)
    Interface 4) Implementation The first step is to setup the connections of all
    the desired sensors with Arduino Uno. Thereafter the Arduino Uno is connected
    to development system that has integrated development environment (IDE) with USB.
    Once the setup is done the code developed for considered case (stable, mono stable
    and walking) is uploaded to Arduino Uno. Hereafter the data is collected related
    to different postural mobility of person and processed by comparing against the
    threshold value to determine the postural mobility level. Fig. 24, shows the plot
    of variation in amplitude due to movement of hand and leg (specifically) in developed
    code. Once the movement is determined thereafter the health information like pulse
    rate, etc. is sent via NBIoT with required transmitted power to eNB. Hereafter
    the health information is processed and corresponding actions are than advised
    to the patients. FIGURE 23. Interface of real time health monitoring setup. Show
    All FIGURE 24. Screenshot of plot with arduino IDE. Show All 5) Performance Analysis
    As per our proposed architecture, we have done the performance analysis on the
    basis of a real-time hardware implementation for healthcare monitoring system
    with all possible case studies. We have deployed sensors on body parts of patients
    to fetch the information regarding postural mobility as shown in Fig 22. (a),
    (b), (c), (d), (e). All the data regarding different postural movements saved
    in the database, which is then processed and compared at the same time. The postural
    movement is observed for 500 sec from 926sec to 1426 sec (Fig 25 describes the
    variation of amplitude due to different postural movement.) FIGURE 25. A Plot
    of variation in amplitude vs Time corresponding to Hand and foot movement during
    different postural mobility, to differentiate between transmission-power to be
    used (Here blue and Red depicts hand movement whereas Green and orange depicts
    the leg movement). Show All Approximately for 94 sec the person has kept his body
    in sleeping condition as shown in Fig. 22 (a),(b), it has been observed that during
    this period, a variation of the different sensor output is low and smooth, output
    amplitude is far below as compared to a threshold value. Hereafter the person
    changed his posture to sitting posture Fig. 22(c) and maintained it for 80 sec.
    For this posture, it was observed that variation is high in comparison to sleeping
    posture, but get stable after a certain time. Hereafter person changed his posture
    from sitting to standing (Fig. 22(d), (e)) and did some movement of hand and leg.
    It can be easily seen that variation is high and fluctuating, some irregular spikes
    appeared in the process. On the basis of performance analysis, we have observed
    that power optimization in all these case studies is very important and because
    this real time analysis aligns with our proposed approach E2AHMS. Hence power
    can be optimized with fair resource allocation to achieve the better quality of
    service is possible through our proposed approach. Conclusion IoT is reforming
    technical industry. This reformation will aid in struggling with global challenges
    that are budding due to depletion of natural resources, inflated food demand,
    scarcity of water, etc. Where on one hand IoT is giving hope for resourceful life
    but on other hand, it will play a crucial role in inflating carbon footprint.
    Hence solutions must be given to reduce carbon emission. In this study recent
    work related to energy efficiency techniques has been surveyed and discussed.
    In contribution toward green-IoT, two novel energy efficient approaches have been
    proposed - ZTPA for smart agriculture and E2AHMS for smart healthcare using NBIoT.
    NBIoT is a new licensed radio technology that guarantees to provide a cost effective,
    reliable, and low power solution. It can coexist with the existing LTE cellular
    networks therefore no new infrastructure is required to be setup from scratch,
    hence installation cost is low. This paper provides a detailed technical view
    of NBIoT and its state-of-the-art. To spur advance research and speed up the extensive
    use of the NBIoT systems the research challenges and open issues of NBIoT are
    also discussed. Appendix A list of current research projects based on IoT is presented

    food chains, mining and energy, transportation, and building & infrastructure
    • We highlight associated challenges Abstract The rise of ubiquitous systems is
    sustained by the development and progressive adoption of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices and their enabling technologies. IoT has been shown to have significant
    potential in high-risk Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) industries. In these
    industries, human lives are at stake and IoT-based applications are primed to
    offer safe, reliable, and efficient solutions due to their ability to operate
    at a fine granular level and provide rich low-level information. We review existing
    published research on IoT-based applications in high-risk EHS industries with
    specific emphasis on healthcare industry, food supply chain (FSC), mining and
    energy industries (oil & gas and nuclear), intelligent transportation (e.g., connected
    vehicles), and building & infrastructure management for emergency response operations
    until 2016. We also highlight IoT-related challenges and proposed solutions in
    high risk EHS industries. We then conclude by presenting research challenges and

    supply chainConnected vehiclesSmart city 1. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects such as home appliances, medical
    devices, vehicles, and RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags. Through this
    network, communication among these objects (‘things'') takes place with no human
    intervention requirement in the loop. Each thing can also be uniquely identified
    at the item-level [118]. Technological advances and progressive adoption of IoT
    technologies have enabled the development of new information and communication
    systems — the ubiquitous information systems. A goal of ubiquitous computing is
    to interconnect the physical world through networks such as the Internet. IoT
    and Cloud Computing are key enabling technologies to build such information and
    communication systems [34]. In general, IoT forms network of objects that (1)
    have unique identifiers, (2) may have the capability to collect data from the
    environment primarily through sensors, (3) operate and interact with the physical
    world by processing collected data, and (4) use the Internet standards to communicate
    and analyze the data for further services. Because the working environment in
    a majority of the EHS industry is highly dynamic with respect to process, labor,
    and equipment management, IoT-enabled real-time Decision Support Systems (DSS)
    are critically valuable often through process mining and optimization techniques.
    Moreover, progress in open wireless communication technologies such as Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID), Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi provide improved ways to connect objects
    together and enable communication not only among themselves but also with the
    Internet. Thus the interconnection among intelligent sensors creates Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN) that have the capability to collect, process, and communicate
    analyzed results in consort with the environment. According to Olgerta et al.,
    Mobile Business Intelligence (m-BI) enhances the capabilities of organizations
    to make decisions ‘on-the-move’ and m-BI reflects an organizing version that is
    prominent during the innovation comprehension process [72]. Gendron et al. explain
    how mobile computing, cloud computing and Big Data support the BI Sweet Spot ecosystem
    [31]. In order to discuss the impact of mobile clinical decision support system
    (CDSS) on decision making process and outcomes, multi-criteria evaluation of a
    mobile field triage decision support system in terms of effectiveness, efficiency,
    satisfaction and use has been illustrated by Haghighi et al. [38]. Picoto et al.
    use a conceptual model for assessing the post-adoption stages of mobile business
    usage and value from an organizational perspective [78]. IoT use has been growing
    rapidly thanks to key applications in industries. With the ability to collect,
    communicate/share and process data, IoT provides huge opportunities to industries.
    For example, IoT-enabled tracking and monitoring can improve the efficiency of
    production and finished product distribution. In addition to improved operations,
    IoT also offers many innovative solutions such as the creation of new business
    models. For example, sales of goods could be augmented with related services with
    the help of IoT-generated data and real-time connectivity [12]. In order to evaluate
    the business value of RFID [10, 11] technology, Tzeng proposed a framework that
    emphasizes delivering business value through refining business processes and expanding
    the business model with the hope that it encourages more organizations to adopt
    RFID [96]. However, IoT adoption in large industrial applications faces many challenges.
    The main challenges include (1) Energy efficiency, (2) Communication and data-related
    challenges (connectivity, latency, throughput, standardization), (3) Scalability
    (network size, interoperability) and (4) Security and safety (reliability, privacy
    protection). Some of these challenges are shared by different IoT technology components:
    from sensor devices to back-end system and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    design [56]. IoT applications have already experienced reasonable success in some
    industries such as healthcare services, food supply chain (FSC) and infrastructure
    monitoring (e.g., energy and environmental management and related application
    domains) [21, 34, 50]. Overall, the similarity among these industries is that
    lives are at stake at the workplace or in the final product/service. Therefore,
    we can classify these as high-risk Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) industries.
    EHS is a discipline and specialty that involves practical aspects of environmental
    protection and safety at work. In simple terms, it is what organizations must
    do to make sure that their activities do not cause harm to anyone. Our focus is
    on high-risk EHS industries with specific emphasis on healthcare service industry,
    food supply chain, mining and energy industries (oil & gas, nuclear), intelligent
    transportation (connected vehicles), and building and infrastructure management
    related to the smart cities concept and emergency response management. IoT-based
    applications are rather widespread in these industries. For example, Ref. [58]
    identifies and classifies current research themes related to data completeness
    in healthcare, Ref. [105] proposes ways for the IS community to engage in the
    development of environmentally sustainable business practices, and Ref. [36] consider
    solutions that ensure uncongested and smooth pilgrim flows with extensive real-time
    reporting. A goal of this paper is therefore to present the characteristics of
    IoT-based applications in high-risk EHS industries through a comprehensive review
    of published research. We also discuss IoT-related challenges and current trends
    in these industries. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
    2, we describe the research methodology. In Section 3, we present the specifics
    of IoT-based applications in high-risk EHS industries. We emphasize IoT-related
    challenges and discuss key solutions that are highlighted in existing published
    research on high-risk EHS industries in Section 4. We discuss research challenges
    and future trends for IoT in high-risk EHS industries in Section 5. In Section
    6, we provide a summary of this paper and conclude. 2. Research methodology We
    present a comprehensive review of published research on IoT technology and its
    applications in high-risk EHS industries. To operationalize this, we searched
    for published papers in international peer-reviewed journals or books in electronic
    bibliographical sources that include Scopus and Web of Science mainly by keywords
    or combination of keywords such as Internet of Things (IoT), Environment, Health
    and Safety (EHS), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Clinical Decision Support
    System (CDSS), healthcare, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), Food Supply Chain
    (FSC), mining, oil and gas, nuclear, connected vehicles, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V),
    AUtonomous Vehicles (AUV), intelligent transportation, smart city, and emergency
    response. We then expanded our search through Google Scholar since ISI journal
    listing is generally considered short in the social sciences and humanities disciplines
    [27]. The initial search based on these keywords resulted in 50 papers. We read
    the abstracts of all 50 papers and selected 30 papers that are highly relevant
    to our study, and disregarded those with a narrow focus only on the EHS industry.
    In the next stage, we used additional keywords obtained from the results of our
    initial search and classified EHS industries into five categories: healthcare,
    food supply chain, mining and energy, intelligent transportation, and building
    and infrastructure. This resulted in 115 papers after filtering by categories,
    topic relevance, time of publication, and contributions. The selected papers included
    computational and analytical methods, conceptual models, design science, and empirical
    studies. The distribution of papers across journals shows that the papers were
    mainly published in journals that cover interdisciplinary topics such as Decision
    Support Systems, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, and International Journal
    of Production Economics. The distribution of published papers across years 2004–2016
    is shown in Fig. 1, indicating the increasing attention paid to this general area.
    The distribution of papers across different industries is shown in Fig. 2 and
    only the high-frequency cases across journals is summarized in Fig. 3. To the
    best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to review IoT applications
    in the EHS industry. Download : Download high-res image (106KB) Download : Download

    3. IoT characteristics and applications in high-risk EHS industries 3.1. Motivations
    for research and implementation of IoT systems in high-risk EHS industries 3.1.1.
    Healthcare industry IoT use in healthcare is enabled by several factors and needs.
    The factors that are mentioned in existing research publications include: A) an
    aging population [34] with increasing number of chronic diseases [3] and fast-growing
    population with increasing access to healthcare services, especially in Asian
    countries [117]; B) a lack of availability when it comes to important patient-related
    medical information [95] and eventually the lack of systematic management of diseases
    throughout the patient pathway [20]; C) the emergence and deployment of key enabling
    technologies [75, 95] such as multi-agent technology [95], RFID technology [3,
    95] as well as wearable technologies [28]; D) the growing adoption and implementation
    of enterprise information system (EIS) [75]; E) the healthcare industry''s turn
    from a hospital-centered model to a hospital-home-balanced model that is slowly
    moving toward a home-centered model [53]; F) the lack of adequate training and
    support to users [19] who are particularly conservatives (both patients and physicians)
    [20, 65]; G) the lack of consideration of data security and privacy (e.g., eavesdropping
    operations and data tampering) [85]. The different requirements observed in existing
    literature are derived from the aforementioned factors, and include: A) A greater
    and easier access to health records and related information [28]; B) The improvement
    in healthcare services quality and cost-efficiency [20, 41, 65, 86, 95], particularly
    in terms of reduced medical errors and increased patient safety with optimized
    processes [95]; C) Interoperable and ubiquitous healthcare services [28, 75].
    In particular, there is a need for higher integration of devices and services
    that could cover all healthcare segments [75], scalable IoT platforms [28], and
    IoT-based applications that integrate the entire disease pathway [20]; D) A customer-centric
    healthcare environment that engages patients in their own healthcare [3, 28, 53]
    since patients prefer treatment personalization [41]; E) The highly-required compliance
    of IoT platforms with security and privacy regulatory and socially-expected standards
    [28, 85]. IoT-based healthcare includes clinical care, home care, healthcare assistance
    [85] and healthcare logistics. The clinical and home care gap is reduced through
    pervasive IoT solutions [28]. Labor, medical device management, IoT-enabled real-time
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) with the possible incorporation of process mining
    and optimization techniques are critically [65, 94, 119] in the dynamic healthcare
    working environment. 3.1.2. Food supply chain [FSC] IoT-based FSC applications
    cover the supply chain from farm to fork [74] and include farm production, food
    processing, packaging, sales & marketing, logistics & distribution, retail, consumers''
    interactions, and waste management [83]. These comprise five stages: produce,
    store, transport, sell, and consume [74]. Several factors facilitate research
    and deployment of IoT-based applications in FSC. We identify the following factors
    from related published literature: A) Variability and perishability of products
    [60, 66, 83, 100, 101]; B) Several recent food safety accidents [5, 26, 40, 60,
    101], especially in Europe (e.g., the 2013 horse meat scandal) and in China (e.g.,
    the 2008 Chinese milk scandal); C) The increasing foodborne illness cases [5,
    71, 90], where foodborne and waterborne diseases kill about 2.2 million people
    annually (World Health Organization, 2002); D) The distance that food travels
    increases significantly with globalization [5]; E) End-consumers demand quality
    [5, 100] and do not sufficiently trust existing food labels [5] while the FSC
    is becoming increasingly customer-oriented [5]; F) Lack of feedback mechanism,
    unpredictable supply variation and consumer behavior changes [66, 74, 83, 101].
    According to the European Commission Information Society (2008), periods of overproduction
    and shortage alternate; G) Sustainable requirements are increasing [83, 100, 101]
    especially when it comes to the management of waste [5]: For example, 300 million
    tons of food products are wasted annually worldwide primarily due to deficient
    refrigeration (International Institute of Refrigeration); H) A large amount of
    data has already been collected but with poor integration and intelligent support
    [100]. Based on the above, we identify different needs and requirements that can
    explain the development of IoT-related applications throughout the food supply
    chain: A) The need for an information system that encompasses the entire food
    supply chain [6, 7, 74]. Therefore the need for interoperability between each
    stakeholder''s information system is strong and consequently the need for related
    global standards [5]; B) The need to obtain rich and real-time information on
    products throughout the FSC: location, origin, characteristics, product batch,
    history throughout the FSC processes [74] and with the appropriate level of granularity
    [101]; C) The need to maintain efficiently the integrity and quality of food products
    [71], especially to meet legal requirements and standards[5]; D) The need to provide
    transparency as well as qualitative and trustworthy information to end-consumers
    [5, 71, 83]; E) The entire industry needs to improve response time (e.g., for
    product recalls) [5]; F) The need to optimize and re-plan the processes efficiently
    and quickly while demand and supply are still hard to predict [5, 101]; G) The
    need for intelligent solutions to analyze large amounts of heterogeneous data
    while seamlessly integrating data and devices for interoperability and flexibility
    purposes [100]. 3.1.3. Mining and energy industries In the mining and energy (oil
    & gas and nuclear) industries, several factors explain the popularity of IoT-related
    applications in research and in business applications: A) A significant number
    of professionals are directly or indirectly involved in the production process
    [111]; B) The production and operation facilities are numerous and widely distributed
    [43, 67, 113] (e.g., multiple site structure with both on-shore and off-shore
    oil facilities with long distances of separation among sites [67]); C) A large
    variety of processes and operations that could lead to a wide range of situations
    [2, 70] (e.g., pipelines could be under water, underground or above the ground
    [2] or in harsh environmental conditions that include salt water, mountain or
    desert [99]); D) Development and increasing interest in cloud computing for oil
    exploration [62]; E) Several safety concerns (e.g., damage to the environment,
    loss of life) [59, 67, 70] such as the leaking oil pipeline in Michigan (USA)
    in 2010 that remained undetected for 17 h [70] or risk of radioactive materials
    release [59]; F) Inaccurate collected data [51, 60] that results from manual control
    processes and approximate estimation (e.g., in oil wells, daily production is
    estimated based on manually collected liquid samples) [113]; G) A lack of unified
    information network platforms that lead to large amounts of data that are isolated
    from one another [113]. We distinguish requirements that explain the increasing
    interest for IoT-based applications in the mining and energy industries: A) The
    need for a high degree of cooperation among different professions/departments/sites
    that make up the industry or a company [67, 111, 113]; B) The need for a real-time
    evaluation system [43, 70]; C) The need for reliable and efficient intelligent
    tools to accurately monitor defects and error occurrence [67]. The main IoT-based
    applications in mining and energy industries (oil & gas, nuclear) include the
    digital mine [111], oil and gas exploration [62], oil and gas management operations
    [46, 62] such as pipeline operations [2, 67, 70, 108] and oil well operations
    [99, 113], and digital nuclear power plant (NPP) [33, 43, 59, 80]. 3.1.4. Connected
    vehicles Connected vehicles refer to the applications and the enabling technologies
    that connect the vehicle to its surroundings [97], both inside and outside the
    vehicle. In this industry, several factors are direct or indirect causes of the
    appeal for IoT-based applications: A) Urban traffic environment is complex and
    variable [120]: growing urbanization [61, 93] (especially in China [120]) leads
    to an increasing number of vehicles in large cities and therefore to more traffic
    congestion and economic challenges and environmental issues [61]; B) Aging population
    is also a factor in improving road safety [93]; C) Car accidents are numerous
    and are often lethal. There is room for improvement in order to reduce the number
    of deaths due to car accidents [110]. According to WHO (in 2002), 25% of the deaths
    due to car accidents could be decreased by increasing safety warning systems at
    highway intersections [69]; D) Existing collected information are inaccurate and
    not sufficiently shared [120]; E) The users demand increasing levels of data access
    while on road [61]; F) Governments facilitate the implementation of connected
    vehicle concepts and technologies by promoting regulation in favor of connected
    vehicles (e.g., in Europe, automatic emergency call systems will be mandatory
    in all new European cars by April 2018) [61, 97]; G) The new transportation service
    delivery ecosystem (e.g., Zipcar, Uber) has changed consumers'' vision on transportation
    services through more flexible multi-modal use [93]. From published research,
    we identify different needs/requirements that highlight the move toward IoT-related
    applications: A) The increasing need for situation awareness [48, 97] among not
    only drivers but also all stakeholders such as pedestrians; B) The urgent need
    to mitigate traffic accidents and hazardous road traffic situations [48, 61, 97];
    C) The need to improve traffic congestion [97] and the overall efficiency of road
    transportation systems[61]; D) The need for low latency and high reliability in
    real-time applications [61, 93]. IoT-based applications in connected vehicles
    include traffic safety and efficiency, infotainment, parking assistance, roadside
    assistance, remote diagnostics, and telematics in autonomous self-driving vehicles
    [97], and classified as [97]: (i) road traffic safety applications, (ii) road
    traffic efficiency and (iii) value-added services. 3.1.5. Building and infrastructure
    management Building and infrastructure management is an industry that covers different
    applications from the ones that are underlined by the broad and general concept
    of Smart City [49, 77, 88, 92, 112] to more detailed applications in emergency
    response operations (e.g., firefighting operations) [25, 109, 115]. On one hand,
    the concept of Smart City includes several heterogeneous IoT-based applications:
    structural health of buildings, waste management, air quality monitoring, noise
    monitoring, traffic congestion, city energy consumption, smart parking, smart
    lighting, etc. [112]. On the other hand, the IoT-based applications in emergency
    response management provide faster, more efficient, and effective emergency response
    operations [25, 109]. They achieve an efficient coordination of the different
    participating organizations. They provide better situation awareness and enable
    the “visibility of response forces and their remaining capabilities” [109]. They
    also handle production monitoring and scheduling in a distributed manufacturing
    environment [35]. In this industry, as mentioned in published research literature,
    IoT-based applications find attractiveness in different existing factors: A) Wide
    and heterogeneous range of resources that are also geographically highly distributed
    [92]; B) Aging and growing population increases the pressure on various aspects
    of urban life [77]; C) The increase in the number and intensity of disasters (e.g.,
    bird flu in 2003, earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorist attacks or incidents such
    as Nanjing propylene explosion accident in 2010) have increased interest in emergency
    technology and management in order to reduce the possibility of serious human
    casualties and property damage [25, 109]; D) Situational awareness and human decision-making
    failures during catastrophic incidents such as Bhopal, the firefighters'' deaths
    during 9/11 and the Three Mile Island nuclear crisis [109]; E) Development of
    emergency response information systems (ERISs) [109]. From these factors, we identify
    requirements mentioned in publications that match with potential value-added solutions
    provided by IoT-based applications: A) The need for visualizing various types
    and granularities for effective and efficient applications [92]; B) The need to
    transparently and seamlessly incorporate a large number of different and heterogeneous
    systems [112]; C) Behind the smart city concept, there are existing needs for
    efficient use of public resources with better quality and cost-effective services
    to citizens [112]; D) The need for better situation awareness and decision-making
    support in emergency response operations [25, 109]. 3.1.6. Conclusion: high-risk
    EHS industries In Table 1, we summarize the main motivations in the industries
    that we considered. We identify some common attributes that are shared by high-risk
    EHS industries. Firstly, existing publications attempt to address issues on the
    lack of data availability or reliability (i.e., inaccurate data or data not sufficiently
    exploited). Secondly, as expected in high-risk EHS industries, increased safety
    (by reducing human errors or human and material casualties in disasters) is a
    motivation that is highlighted in publications. Thirdly, publications in high-risk
    EHS industries emphasize complexity and heterogeneity of the observed processes
    or things that require IoT-based applications to tackle them. The need for higher
    quality of services (especially for real-time services) seems to drive existing
    research on high-risk EHS industries. However, not all high-risk EHS industries
    share the same motivations. Aging and growing population or customer-centric industry
    are changing factors that explain published research on IoT-based applications
    in several high-risk EHS industries but not in the entire sector. As a result,
    we also identify motivations that are shared among some industries but may be
    considered as points of difference inside the broader high-risk EHS sector (e.g.,
    the growing sustainable requirements). Table 1. Motivations of research and implementation

    X 3.2. Specific characteristics of IoT applications in high-risk EHS industries
    3.2.1. System architecture A set of decision support features is provided by analyzing
    online information based on Simon''s bounded rationality in Ref. [18]. The traditional
    architecture for remote health monitoring [41] comprises: A) A physical layer
    that consists of a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) for data acquisition and
    some services executions; B) communication and networking layer for data transmission;
    C) service layer for cloud processing. In FSC, for similar layers (identification,
    sensing, actuation/data exchange/information integration/application services
    [101]), research papers propose specific architectures in response to FSC complexity
    and requirements. Therefore, supply chain-wide IoT systems can be [101]: A) Centralized:
    data are collected in shared databases; B) Linear: (especially traceability) data
    are transferred from one FSC stakeholder to the next; C) Distributed: FSC stakeholders
    interconnect their own information systems to exchange (especially traceability)
    data. The distributed approach is the choice option in existing published research,
    especially with the development of the Electronic Product Code Information Services
    (EPCIS) [101]. But existing information and traceability systems in FSC are based
    specifically on the partial linear approach (“one up, one down”) [6] In mining
    and energy industries, publications propose different architectures. One proposition
    is to integrate situation awareness in information systems to improve reliability
    of a real-time evaluation system [70], acting and tracking. The sensing mechanism
    enables the system to identify exceptions as well as collect abnormal data. The
    acting mechanism enables the operational decision maker to act accordingly through
    filtering, automatic business rule and workflow monitoring. Eventually the tracking
    mechanism enables him/her to follow up on the progress of the operations. Otherwise
    the structural components of the existing proposed architectures look very similar
    to that in other industries: an acquisition layer, a transport layer and a service
    layer [113]. IoT solutions architecture for intelligent transportation is shared
    between centralized and decentralized topology [97]. From the sensors layer, data
    are exchanged wirelessly via different communication technologies (especially
    short-range communication technology such as IEEE 802.11p and cellular networks
    such as 3G and LTE [97]). This communication system forms a vehicular ad hoc network
    (VANET) [61, 97, 110] that could be autonomous with processing capabilities. For
    example, fog computing could bring intelligence at the edge of the network [9]).
    Nevertheless, a centralized network topology such as cellular networks could be
    selected [97]. As a result, all data are transferred to the centralized network
    through base stations (BS) [97]. However, the dominant architecture in existing
    research uses a different networking level and not only that of a VANET or a centralized
    network [30, 110]. To create a pervasive environment, the cloud resources could
    be organized in three layers [110]: a vehicular cloud that is an inter-vehicle
    network (VANET), the roadside cloud (a local cloud that is established with the
    adjacent roadside units), and a central cloud (that could be accessed through
    cellular communication or short-range communication with road-side infrastructure).
    In Ref. [30], those different levels of cloud computing form the paradigm that
    lead to the development of autonomous vehicles (AUV). In building and infrastructure
    management, most of the services are based on a centralized architecture [112].
    Various heterogeneous data streams from peripheral devices deployed over the urban
    area converge toward a central back-end system, the control center, that provides
    storage and processing capabilities. Interoperability being a crucial issue, the
    IoT service architecture needs to link unconstrained protocols (commonly used
    as the Internet communication standard) and constrained protocols (required by
    constrained devices) [112]. For emergency response, information systems have stronger
    requirements, such as the need for dynamic and real-time information, to work
    in extreme and stress-filled environments [109]. 3.2.2. Sensor level In healthcare,
    the first specification for IoT-based applications arises from the sensor level.
    The sensor types themselves span a wide and heterogeneous range [28]. For example,
    environmental passive sensors or body-centric RFID tags that are wearable or implantable.
    These can further be divided into more specific categories according to their
    different technical properties (e.g., the use of chemically interactive materials
    to measure temperature, humidity or the presence of specific gases) [3]. These
    sensors need to have the capabilities to measure health-related information (e.g.,
    detect chemical signatures) [28]. A number of heterogeneous data inputs can be
    integrated with the IoT platform [41]. Lastly, sensors used in healthcare have
    a focus on specific properties such as power consumption [28]. Moreover sensor
    networks are expected to be non-invasive in order to not constrain patient''s
    mobility and to be more easily accepted in a personal environment [86]. In FSC,
    IoT-based applications are focused on traceability. Therefore, the sensor layer
    in FSC is mainly made up of RFID tags that are not specific to the FSC domain
    [74]. The essential characteristics of traceability sensors include breadth (i.e.,
    the amount of collected data), depth (i.e., the continuity of the traceability
    information throughout the FSC), and precision (i.e., data reliability with reference
    to the movement of food products) [5]. Since food product spoilage could have
    many causes (microbial infestation, bio-chemical changes, mechanical damages and
    physical changes [74]), the sensors used in these applications must be more heterogeneous
    to achieve richer information collection: future IoT applications for FSC should
    consider developing a comprehensive sensor portfolio in a systematic way [74].
    For instance, to detect pathogens in food products, the development of mobile
    safety laboratories are enabled by the combination of biosensors and IoT [90].
    Ref. [24] proposes a sensor network architecture for FSC based on RFID tags and
    autonomous embedded modules. In mining and energy industries, the sensor layer
    needs to be sophisticated to collect data from a wide range of sources. In the
    coal industry, sensors measure a few different data types: geo-stress data, seismic
    data, ventilation data, hydrology data, gas information, miners position, among
    others [111]. The acquisition layer in oil well monitoring includes flow sensors,
    water temperature sensors and oil-water ratio sensors [113]. The sensor layer
    in these industries include a large and wide distribution of sensor nodes to collect
    essential data across various processes and operations [2]. These nodes may be
    at different locations (under water, underground or above the ground). So, sensor
    calibration and positioning could be affected by many environmental effects (e.g.,
    wind, humidity) [2]. Therefore, the use of ground-penetrating radar techniques
    or acoustic transducers enable pipeline monitoring to be reliable and in real-time
    with the deployment of fewer nodes [2]. Eventually, energy efficiency and sensor
    lifetime are crucial parameters for sensor networks in these industries. The leverages
    to increase both these parameters include decreasing the wake-up time of the nodes
    or reducing data transmission rate. To this end, aggregated sensing, fog computing
    techniques via intelligent nodes or vibration energy harvester are possible solutions
    that could facilitate such leverage instantiations [2]. IoT-based applications
    use many heterogeneous sensors to generate and communicate accurate and relevant
    data. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are based on different sensor
    technologies in addition to vision/camera systems [97]. The collected data could
    be classified as [120]: traffic flow (e.g., flow rate, speed, density), traffic
    emergency information, real-time information about in-transit vehicles and drivers
    (e.g., location, driver tiredness status), and dynamic traffic control and management
    information. As a consequence, the number of sensors that are employed in a vehicle
    is booming. By 2020, it is estimated that a vehicle could have as many as 200
    intra-vehicle sensors [79]. These intra-vehicle sensors have specific characteristics:
    A) They are stationary, and enable the network to have a stable topology over
    time [61]; B) They are usually directly (one hop) connected to an electrical control
    unit (ECU) and form a simple star-topology [61]; C) They do not have energy constraints
    thanks to wired power connection in the vehicle [61]. In addition to intra-vehicle
    sensors in connected automobiles, road-side sensors also provide data that enable
    IoT-based applications in connected vehicles [30]. There is a need to tackle sensor
    lifetime issue to avoid the need for mass replacements in shorter time periods
    since automobiles typically last longer than 10 years [37]. In building and infrastructure
    management, sensing devices are geographically highly distributed and heterogeneous
    [25, 92]. They usually have constrained computational resources [92]. 3.2.3. Communication
    In healthcare, communication links are restricted by regulatory and industry standards
    especially when it comes to implantable devices. The sensors have to be compliant
    with local emission regulations [3]. In FSC, publications do not discuss specific
    communication standards. Information routing in distributed models occur through
    hybrid routing approach rather than a centralized one. By combining centralized
    and peer-to-peer routing to connect all users to one another, the IoT-based information
    system facilitates more confidentiality through direct communication while reducing
    data traffic with the central server [100]. In mining and energy industries, communication
    is a key feature of the IoT system because the sensors are widely scattered and
    distributed due in part to the specific structures and processes in those industries
    (e.g., sensors could be widely distributed underground as well as under water
    or over the ground). However traditional communication modes such as wireless
    digital radio, wireless bridge, satellite communication, and Zigbee result in
    a high error rate in these industries [113] (e.g., wireless signals are attenuated
    underground and under water [2]). Therefore, extensive use of the world''s currently
    available mobile communication system, the GPRS or GSM, is necessary for comprehensive
    coverage [2, 113]. In addition, since sensor nodes could be under water, underground
    or above the ground, the use of wireless communication is also combined with wired
    communication or electro-magnetic induction techniques to transmit the signal
    [2]. For nuclear power plant management, wireless communication has to deal with
    the challenges that are associated with electromagnetic interferences [33]. Moreover,
    in these industries, designing, developing, and maintaining communication systems
    is a matter of high security [2]. In connected vehicles, multiple categories of
    communication are required for seamless connected links between different components
    of the connected vehicle environment: A) Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
    [9, 61, 97]; B) Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication [9, 97]. This category
    can further be divided into vehicle-to-sensor (V2S) communication, vehicle-to-Internet
    (V2I) communication, and vehicle-to-road infrastructure (V2R) communication [61]);
    C) Infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) communication [9]. Here, infrastructure
    refers to access points such as Roadside units (RSUs), Wi-Fi, 3G, LTE, and smart
    traffic lights [9]. Vehicle-to-Internet communication is commonly based on off-the-shelf
    technologies that are available for mass-market [61]. So connected vehicle manufacturers
    have brought in the connectivity from drivers'' smartphones (3G/4G) or they have
    built in the connectivity by including cellular services in the car dashboard
    [61]. The other solution to have vehicle-to-Internet communication is a drive-thru
    Internet that allows the user to connect to the Internet when the vehicle is within
    Wi-Fi coverage [61, 73]. This solution results in a lower cost for data acquisition
    but requires a huge infrastructure deployment to have good coverage. In the connected
    vehicle industry, a communication challenge is due to the high mobility of the
    vehicles. High vehicle mobility generates high frequency changes in network topology
    while communication is limited and surrounding obstacles are numerous [61]. Other
    challenges also exist in connected vehicles. The harsh environment in intra-vehicle
    communication is primarily a result of severe scattering within very limited space
    and often with no line-of-sight [61]. If interferences are a problem, with an
    increasing number of connected vehicles and high urban density, spectrum scarcity
    is an issue that affects both V2 V and V2R communication [61]. Security is important
    to protect communication in intelligent transportation systems from malicious
    attacks [65]. Multi-hop techniques are used to maintain connectivity between vehicles
    and the Internet [61]. In building and infrastructure management, the communication
    layer requires links across a wide geographical area to support transfer of potentially
    large amount of data among a large number of sensing devices [112]. Based on their
    goal in regard to the realization of IoT-based applications, communication technologies
    are either unconstrained (traditional LAN, MAN, and WAN communication technologies
    such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi) or constrained (IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth and Bluetooth
    Low Energy, IEEE 802.11 Low Power, PLC, NFC and RFID) [76]. When unconstrained
    technologies offer higher reliability and throughput and lower latency, they require
    high energy consumption. This is one of the reasons why constrained technology
    is sometimes preferred in order to save energy while ensuring data transfer despite
    their lower quality. 3.2.4. Back-end system Data analytics is crucial in healthcare
    for quick and accurate decision-making [28] through data storing, reporting, visualization,
    monitoring or prediction. It enables IoT-based solutions to enhance traditional
    healthcare from a post facto diagnose-and-treat reactive paradigm to a proactive
    framework for disease prognosis [41], from a descriptive approach to a predictive
    one [16] especially when paired with machine-learning [16]. In FSC, the back-end
    system is crucial for IoT systems. By enabling information exchange among all
    FSC stakeholders, the back-end system allows IoT solutions to encompass the entire
    FSC [74]. Moreover, data analytics is necessary to process the huge amount of
    collected data. Therefore, a back-end system with the right capabilities (storage
    and processing capacities, user-friendly user interfaces, etc.) facilitates better
    and more specific management of the FSC. For example, the First Expired First
    Out priority could be implemented to manage the inventory rather than the classical
    First In First Out logic [83]. In mining and energy industry, the key successful
    feature is a well-designed combination of cloud computing technology and an information
    management system [62]. The back-end system usually includes a technical database,
    a real-time database, an enterprise resource planning database, and large data
    warehouse [62]. In intelligent transportation, the back-end system could play
    different roles. It could be the crucial component of a centralized network system
    such as in a cellular network [97]. However, in more decentralized networks such
    as VANET [97], its role is more to provide a higher level of intelligence with
    more processing capabilities (analytics and big data) as well as storage capabilities
    [9]. In building and infrastructure management, the back-end system plays a central
    role because it gathers the data from various heterogeneous devices [112]. The
    back-end system is the core of the control center that provides storage and processing
    capabilities. In emergency response management, the control center needs to gather
    continuous and real-time information to be effective and efficient during each
    emergency response moment (mobilization, preliminary situation assessment, and
    intervention) [109]. 3.2.5. Business/market aspects IoT-based healthcare applications
    could cover a wide consumer market demand despite its reliability and regulation
    issues [50]. These applications have better intrinsic value indeed because they
    tend to trigger more systemic effects [20]. Healthcare industry is different from
    traditional industries because human lives are at stake. IoT solutions consider
    safety as the top priority with the consequence that this industry tends to be
    more resistant to change. The expected payback period on investment is also long
    [65]. In FSC, IoT-based applications are still at an early stage [74]. The state
    of current FSC could explain this fact. FSC is very complex indeed: A) it includes
    a large diversity of stakeholders and industries from farm-to-fork [71, 74, 100]
    with the dominance of SMEs [83]; B) it is spread across the world and, with globalization,
    food products increasingly travel longer distances [5, 74]; C) the processes are
    very complex: converging and diverging flows (e.g., two raw agricultural products
    are processed to form one food product; conversely, several products such as meat
    and milk are from one animal) and high process variety (produce, store, transport,
    sell, consume [74]) [74, 100, 101]; D) the quality of food products changes throughout
    the entire FSC [5]. In mining and energy industry, IoT-based applications could
    result in significant competitive gains. In mining, self-driving vehicles promise
    to raise productivity by 25% and output by 5% or more and cut health and safety
    costs as much as 20% by reducing the number of workplace accidents [12]. However,
    IoT-based applications not only involve the collection of data but also the provision
    of real-time decision-making support with the help of collected data. In the oil-drilling
    industry, only 1% of the data from the 30,000 sensors on a typical oil rig are
    used [12], signifying the huge potential when more such data are used to make
    decisions. As for intelligent transportation, the connected vehicle market represents
    significant potential. According to Transparency Market Research (2013), the global
    market is expected to reach USD 131.9 billion by 2019. Published research alludes
    to business plan for IoT-based applications in intelligent transportation industry.
    Ref. [8] relies on a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model to support cloud services
    for connected vehicles. From a broader perspective as the smart city concept,
    IoT-based applications for connected vehicles could be supported by a market place
    for vehicle-generated data [77]. This solution is a business model known as sensing
    as a service. In IoT-based smart city applications, some publications advocate
    for the deployment of those that are likely to succeed first [103]. For urban
    IoT, these applications have social utility and clear return on investment (e.g.,
    smart parking, smart buildings) in order to create successful examples of IoT-based
    applications [103]. Such IoT-based applications are very interesting because they
    generate a win-win situation by both increasing the quality of the offered service
    for the citizen and reducing the operational costs for the provider [23]. 3.2.6.
    Conclusion: high-risk EHS industries To summarize, we gather the main general
    characteristics of IoT applications by industry in Table 2. Overall, in high-risk
    EHS industries, system architecture design is divided between centralized architecture
    for more encompassing IoT-based applications and decentralized architecture for
    more sophisticated and specific IoT-based applications. In the sensor layer, devices
    are usually numerous and widely distributed across physical locations. They are
    also heterogeneous in order to collect data from complex and heterogeneous environment
    (processes or things). In terms of communication, standardization is highly required
    in order to reach better interoperability among heterogeneous data sources. However,
    resource-constrained devices require novel solutions to overcome the constraints.
    Solutions such as multi-hop routing have become prevalent or widely adopted in
    existing research. For back-end system, the same division as in system architecture
    design is seen. Centralized back-end systems gather all the data from all sources
    to provide services (especially big data and storage). Decentralized architecture
    leads to the back-end system as a support for a more autonomous system. Additionally,
    it brings intelligence and storage capabilities. Since business aspects are more
    various and heterogeneous, it is difficult to identify a trend among the high-risk
    EHS industries. Table 2. Specific characteristics of IoT applications in high-risk

    challenges in high-risk EHS industries 4.1. Challenges as mentioned in published
    research papers Current research in high-risk EHS industries attempts to understand
    and address the gap between small implementations of successful research projects
    [91] and large systematic adoption in the entire industry: in healthcare industry
    [19, 20, 50, 75], in FSC [74, 101], in mining and energy industries [62, 113],
    in intelligent transportation industry [37, 61, 98], and in building and infrastructure
    management industry [103, 112]. To successfully become mainstream and to deploy
    large IoT systems throughout the specific high-risk EHS industry, the IoT-based
    applications need to deal with the following challenges. We can classify them
    as traditional technical IoT-related challenges – that are commonly listed as
    mentioned in the introduction – and social and economic challenges that deal more
    with the environment rather than the IoT system itself. The following are the
    IoT-related technical challenges: A) Energy efficiency; B) Communication and data-related
    challenges (connectivity, latency, throughput, standardization); C) Scalability
    (network size, interoperability); D) Security and safety (reliability, privacy
    protection). For social and economic challenges, extant literature identifies
    the following: A) Business modelB) Standardization: For instance, in healthcare,
    researchers have developed several different protocols especially for wearable
    devices without taking into account the interoperability with other systems [86].
    In China, for example, hospitals have developed their own information systems
    based on their own standards that makes future higher integration (regional or
    national) difficult [117]; C) Compliance with regulatory and industry standards;
    D) Community support and staff training; E) Affordability vs. high cost of implementation;
    F) Absence of global or national standards and regulation; G) Time-to-market for
    IoT-based applications. Table 3 sums up the different mentions of IoT-related
    challenges in existing research and by industry. Table 3. IoT-related challenges

    A) healthcare: security and privacy, standardization, and scalability; B) FSC:
    standardization, interoperability, flexibility, and scalability to develop IoT-based
    applications that encompass the entire supply chain; C) mining and energy industries:
    communication and energy consumption challenges and reliability issues; D) connected
    vehicles: reliable and efficient connectivity and communication are crucial as
    well as security and privacy issues; E) building and infrastructure management:
    interoperability and standardization challenges and privacy issues seem to be
    among the most important issues. 4.2. Proposed solutions offered by published
    research papers 4.2.1. Healthcare industry Research suggests strategic placement
    of gateways in IoT systems to enhance their properties in order to deal with energy
    efficiency issues, and data availability and reliability issues while meeting
    patient''s needs (mobility and convenience requirements, non-invasive devices)
    [64, 75, 82]. The gateway or bridging point is the unit that connects the sensor
    network to the back-end system, which is usually a remote health center. In the
    healthcare industry, those gateways are stationary and reduce resource constraints,
    in contrast with low-power sensor nodes that require high energy-efficiency to
    last longer and reliably record critical health information. Thus, the gateways
    can be enhanced with more properties: local data storage, local data processing
    power (data compression, fusion, filtering), data mining (the gateways could form
    a so-called “fog computing layer”), security-related tasks (thanks to the processing
    and memory properties) [82]. The gateways also make interoperability (in terms
    of device, protocol or data) and reconfigurability easier [82]. As a result, the
    “smart e-Health gateway” could become a local database that ensures data availability
    and that performs intelligent processes to deliver quicker preliminary information
    without compromising the energy-efficiency of sensor networks [82]. Some research
    publications mention multi-hop networks in IoT-based healthcare applications [39,
    64]. Existing research defines Body-to-Body Network (BBN) as a mesh network that
    uses people to transmit data within a limited geographic area [64]. This concept
    can readily deal with user mobility requirement as well as issues like energy-efficiency
    and reliability (quality of service ; QoS). Such multi-hop communication offers
    the possibility to connect larger sensor networks by enabling more wireless links
    between each node [39]. The WBANs are connected to each other and data routing
    is created to transfer the data up until the connector device (i.e., the gateway).
    Thus BBN design should consider an energy-efficient routing, QoS-aware traffic
    management and mobility management [64]. However, new and traditional challenges
    appear with the BBN concept such as wireless channel propagation issues (energy-efficiency,
    interference and coexistence of different communication technologies that share
    the same radio spectrum, interoperability issues, ethical challenges) [64]. Another
    solution that has been recommended to improve IoT solutions in healthcare is parallel
    processing [22]. Task level parallelism (TLP) consists of processing different
    health data streams in parallel. The use of multicore technology enables optimization
    of available resources in terms of processing performance and power consumption.
    As a result the sensor network has the potential to have an increased lifetime.
    Low adoption rate could be managed by providing an IoT solution with a value-centric
    approach rather than a technology-centric one [75]. Therefore, the business plan
    is as important as the integrative architecture of the IoT solution. A win-win
    situation could be created by a carefully designed surplus-sharing contract under
    which both the supplier and the health care organization will improve with change
    in the scanning system [15]. In order to integrate in-home healthcare in a larger
    IoT solution, Ref. [75] proposed a business plan that consists of a cooperative
    ecosystem between traditional healthcare providers and Internet content providers.
    Moreover, different types of IT-enabled capabilities could shape, and be shaped
    by, the home health care provider''s responses to environmental changes [89].
    A value-centric approach could result in higher user acceptance especially if
    medical staff (e.g., physicians, nurses) are aware of the overall value generated
    as well as that specifically for them [19]. Ref. [54] finds that technology push,
    need pull, and presence of champions are determinants of RFID adoption in organizations,
    and the relationship between those three categories and the likelihood of adopting
    RFID are strengthened or weakened by organizational readiness. As a result, training
    and awareness campaigns have an important role in wider adoption [19]. Ref. [50]
    also recommends taking a piecemeal approach to bring IoT innovation in healthcare
    in order to avoid the resilience from this particular conservative industry and
    why [107] thinks perceived service availability (PSA) and personal innovativeness
    in IT (PIIT) may be the important drivers in TAM and TPB. In general, RFID barriers
    are considered to be lower and benefits to be higher by both future implementers
    and current implementers compared to non-implementers [84]. Several publications
    propose theoretical or pilot projects to tackle different issues such as better
    integration of pervasive healthcare services with general healthcare services
    [75, 86], an adaptive knowledge-based system for healthcare logistics [65], a
    leaner and more parsimonious model than the DeLone and McLean model which identifies
    the particular factors that are important to achieve success [17], higher privacy
    protection and more security in IoT-based healthcare applications [45, 85], the
    creation of an IoT solution through the integration of eHealth smart devices,
    telemedicine instruments and hospital information systems [29], a 2Bin inventory
    system for controlling medical supplies [87] or the development of real-time IoT-based
    solutions for mobile health with a focus on interoperability (by using standard
    IoT hardware and an existing operating system) [39]. 4.2.2. Food supply chain
    Proposals for novel architectures or IoT platform implementation that encompasses
    the entire FSC exist. But those solutions struggle to be adopted by FSC stakeholders.
    The lack of a comprehensive information system that encompasses the entire FSC
    could be due to a lack of comprehensive picture among FSC stakeholders [74]. The
    prevailing use of RFID solutions and a technology-centric approach (focus on what
    the technology provides) in existing research leads to a low adoption rate or
    a poor collaboration toward larger IoT solutions. The dominant framework should
    be value-centric (focus on what the technology should provide). IoT-based applications
    with income-centric (e.g., shelf-life prediction, sales premium, precision food
    production, insurance cost reduction) focus are more likely to be adopted because
    of an expected shorter payback period [74]. Other barriers have been identified
    to explain or avoid unsuccessful realization of large IoT platforms [101]: A)
    The potential unwillingness to share information among stakeholders; B) The lack
    of confidence regarding data security and reliability; C) Limitations of existing
    contractual relationships and pricing strategies; D) The need for critical mass;
    E) The uncertainty about impact on business practices and business model. To overcome
    these barriers, existing research papers recommend the use of generic technologies
    and SaaS-approaches (Software as a service) as proposed in the FIspace platform
    [7, 101]. The trustworthiness of the IoT system is crucial for its successful
    adoption. It is used in pilot projects such as the Internet of Agricultural Things
    (AIoT) with the use of GS1 standards and electronic pedigree [60]. With IoT, physical
    objects can leave their traces in the cyber space: electronic pedigree is an example
    of this kind of digital signature. Thus, electronic pedigree is a crucial technology
    that has been enhanced for the specific use of FSC in existing research: features
    have been added from the pedigree standard (EPCglobal, GS1 now) to reach more
    trustworthy tracking service to monitor and supervise the production and supply
    of food [40]. Several research papers propose novel architectures (such as Refs.
    [7, 100, 101, 116]) or even propose the creation of pilot projects (such as [60]
    in China or Refs. [47, 66, 121]). Both focus on finding IoT-based solutions that
    could encompass the entire FSC or make each stakeholder''s integration within
    the FSC easier. Thus, the Smart Agri-Food Logistics systems [47, 100] succeed
    to gather three key features: real-time virtualization, logistics connectivity
    (good throughput and reliable data exchange) and logistics intelligence (i.e.,
    extracted intelligent analysis and reports from the collected data). The information
    system benefits also from high flexibility and scalability through the use of
    Generic Enablers and Domain-Specific Enablers. They are software modules that
    can be easily re-used and shared to enable further customization (pick, plug and
    play) [47, 100]. Eventually the objective of the Smart Agri-food Project is to
    create a marketplace for IoT-based applications in FSC similar to Google Play
    or Apple Store [47]. This market place, the FIspace platform, enables searching
    for and the use of specific services and applications such as Greenhouse management
    and control scenarios [7]. 4.2.3. Mining and energy industries Existing research
    highlights the key role of cloud computing technology and big data analytics in
    the development of IoT-based applications in mining and energy industries (oil
    & gas, nuclear) [2, 62, 67, 70]. Cloud computing technology has the potential
    to overcome some IoT-related challenges: throughput (for example with the batch
    processing job approach [62]) or affordability (renting infrastructure equipment
    and using service providers of cloud computing applications [62]). Overall cloud
    computing technology enables more innovation in the industry through the use of
    open source software that could benefit the entire industry [62]. Moreover the
    use of machine learning techniques increases the functionalities and reliability
    of big data analytics. For instance, the use of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) sensors
    and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) allows for a better and more reliable estimation
    of the defect depth in oil and gas pipelines [67]. The main mentioned solution
    in existing research to tackle the communication issue in these industries is
    the use of GPRS or GSM, the world''s current mobile communication system, for
    comprehensive coverage [2, 113]. To optimize the communication and data transmission
    process and in the end reduce crucial energy consumption, the gateways and sensor
    nodes could have processing capabilities in order to pre-process the data through
    compression or filtering techniques [2]. In Ref. [99], the network structure for
    oil well monitoring and control system is designed with the adoption of a clustering
    algorithm in order to lower energy consumption and so increase communication reliability.
    Moreover using multi-hop routing enables the systems to reduce the communication
    range of each node. It results in a more energy efficient solution [2]. The combination
    of multi-hop routing and computational capabilities results in better secure communication
    because in case of failure or malicious disruptions, the wireless networks can
    reconfigure the topology in order to ensure data transmission [43]. Even in nuclear
    power plant management, multi-hop routing is a proposed solution to electro-magnetic
    interferences and other constraints that reduce communication reliability [33,
    43]. [33] implements multi-hop routing via Peer-to-Peer communication in a Zigbee
    wireless sensor network. However this last solution has a low adoption rate in
    practice because sensor deployment does not have a predefined topology [2]. For
    IoT-based applications in mining and energy industries, published research includes
    theoretical frameworks or implemented projects. To create a digital mines system,
    Ref. [111] proposes a framework including the main expected applications in the
    industry: mining digital platforms, production technology management system, safety
    management system, and production information integrated query system. Others
    deal with similar frameworks that enable the mining and energy industries to have
    guidelines to integrate and implement IoT-related applications in mining [80],
    oil production industry [46, 99], and nuclear power plant management [59]. Pilot
    IoT-based system projects or applications in oil pipeline monitoring [70, 108]
    and in radiation monitoring at nuclear facilities [33, 80] have been implemented.
    Ref. [70] proposes a small/medium-scale project for reliable predictive maintenance
    system (PMS) in oil and gas pipeline operations. Situation awareness design (sensing,
    acting, tracking) supports better and standardized management and monitoring of
    oil and gas pipeline operations. Ref. [108] implements an oil and gas pipeline
    nondestructive testing system through the combination of ultrasonic testing and
    magnetic flux leakage (MFL) sensors. Ref. [80] has implemented and tested a passive
    sensor that is based on hydrogen-pressure dosimeters for wireless high radiation
    monitoring in nuclear power plants. 4.2.4. Connected vehicles Enabling reliable
    and efficient communication while taking into account the high mobility of the
    things in intelligent transportation is crucial. To this end, several institutions
    (especially the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, ETSI) have proposed
    standards for all parts of the protocol stack [97]. The aim of standardization
    is the interoperability between different components, devices or systems. For
    instance, in Europe, 30 MHz has been set apart only for the use of vehicular communication
    at 5.875–5.905 GHz in road traffic safety applications; for non-safety-related
    applications, it is 20 MHz at 5.855–5.875 GHz [97]. Existing published research
    also highlights some solutions to address the mobility challenge. GeoNetworking
    enables a station to adapt data routing by focusing more on the list of neighbors
    it can hear rather than maintain routing tables [97]. Ref. [110] proposes a three-layered
    architecture for the vehicular network (vehicular cloud, roadside cloud and central
    cloud) in order to achieve efficiency, continuity and reliability of cloud services
    for mobile vehicles. Another solution creates a communication path (e.g., with
    several trucks) that could lead to less mobility-related interferences and therefore
    to a more reliable signal [61]. However, this technique is feasible only on a
    highway and not in urban areas where line-of-sight is blocked by the surrounding
    environment. Eventually, these solutions rely on higher level cooperation among
    vehicles by using multi-hop techniques to relay data through V2 V and V2R communications
    with more reliability [61]. Dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) use for
    V2 V and V2R communications leads to spectrum scarcity risk [61]. A solution is
    the use of complementary technology such as dynamic spectrum access (DSA). It
    allows vehicles to communicate opportunistically on spatially and/or temporally
    vacant licensed spectrum of other communication systems. Another solution is the
    use of TV white space for V2 V communication in urban areas due to its propagation
    and building penetration properties vs. the DSRC frequency band [104]. To reconcile
    mobility challenges and the need for real-time information and services, the use
    of fog computing is an option [9]. Fog computing brings intelligence to network
    edge by providing constrained processing capabilities at network nodes. It results
    in better latency and location awareness. It also allows for widespread node location
    in networks while ensuring mobility and interoperability among the large number
    of nodes. If data privacy and security concerns are solved, Ref. [93] identifies
    five connected vehicle killer applications that rely on the integration of multiple
    data streams: fatigue detection, real-time assistance for parking and accidents,
    anger management and stress reduction, keyless authentication, and Do-it-yourself
    (DIY) diagnostics. The regulatory aspect of privacy is significant. For example,
    the European Parliament has strengthened the draft law''s data-protection clause
    to align with mandatory implementation of the automatic emergency call (eCall)
    system in all new European cars by April 2018 [71]. On the other hand, Ref. [98]
    defines the requirements to visualize the design quality of the system with a
    focus on safety and privacy. With the same focus, Ref. [52] reviews architectural
    requirements (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, communication and timing)
    and existing solutions (such as honeypots attached to wireless gateway to learn
    about new attacks and then to improve the next system version) to deal with safety
    and privacy concerns and so avoid disastrous safety implications. Ref. [114] provides
    another solution framework to protect connected vehicles from malware attacks.
    There are also proposed designs or implementations of IoT-based applications (such
    as the five killer applications for connected car [61], the pedestrian safety
    application through automatic braking or evasive steering [48]) or supporting
    components (such as a platform for prototyping telematics services [37]) in order
    to increase the adoption rate of IoT-based applications in the automotive industry.
    Through a prototyping platform for connected-vehicle software and application
    templates, Ref. [37] presents a pattern-based approach to decrease time-to-market
    of IoT-based applications (thanks to reusable functionality and guidelines) and
    increase flexibility (each of the platform services are designed to deal with
    unpredictable workloads). Ref. [32] implements a road condition monitoring and
    alerting application. This application relies on the use of an in-vehicle Smartphone
    and the concepts of crowd sourcing and participatory sensing. It offers an affordable
    and energy-efficient solution while using rich processing capabilities (of smartphones)
    and protecting data privacy (via anonymization). 4.2.5. Building and infrastructure
    management Some studies present solutions to tackle interoperability issues. Ref.
    [92] introduces a framework for a decentralized service-oriented cloud platform
    for the deployment and execution of context [57] and user-centric IoT applications.
    This framework provides interoperability through a decentralized cloud platform
    that results in scalability and flexibility for real-time smart city applications.
    Some research studies go further by proposing frameworks to realize a unified
    urban-scale Information and Communications Technology (ICT) platform [42, 68].
    On a smaller scale, an experimental study at the University of Padova (Italy)
    implemented a smart city to promote early-adoption of open data IoT-based applications
    in public administration [14]. A smart lighting application was developed through
    the deployment of a wireless sensor network with more than 300 nodes. Interoperability
    issues could sometimes be related to political issues with the need for cooperation
    among all stakeholders. In smart city applications, Ref. [102] suggests the creation
    of a dedicated department in the city to avoid arguments about the attribution
    of decision-making power among different stakeholders. Other solutions tackle
    general IoT challenges and issues that undermine the applications'' credibility
    and attractiveness. Ref. [77] proposes a business model for smart cities: sensing
    as a service. It consists of creating a marketplace for sensor-generated data
    that benefits from the creation of a win-win situation: data publishers and service
    providers as intermediaries between sensor owners and data consumers. This cloud
    computing environment, through participatory sensing, reduces data acquisition
    cost, incentivizes people to get sensors and to share data, and so makes more
    data available for potential service providers. However, even if anonymization
    could tackle the data privacy issue, many challenges still remain and make this
    model less attractive. For Ref. [115], the government should be the leading entity
    to build a safety management model because it could tackle issues related to social
    acceptance (e.g., acceptance of the pervasive sensors) by ensuring public welfare.
    4.2.6. Conclusion: high-risk EHS industries We classify existing proposed solutions
    by previously identified challenges (Table 4). Existing published research in
    high-risk EHS industries seems to be focused on offering solutions to tackle technical
    challenges more than social and economic issues. As safety concerns are very high
    in high-risk EHS industries, existing research attempts to focus first on reliable
    and scalable IoT-based applications rather than on adoption rate (even if some
    research papers tackle such issues especially for more advanced IoT-based applications).

    (responsibility, consensus between stakeholders) 5. Research challenges and future
    trends Based on our review of existing published literature, we identify several
    future trends in healthcare: A) The Internet of Bio-Nanothings [1]: Synthetic
    biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of biological embedded
    computing devices through biological cells'' functionalities (execution of DNA-based
    instructions, the transformation of chemical energy, molecular communication),
    new IoT solutions offer huge opportunities such as intra-body sensing and actuation.
    However, it comes with challenges for research such as the interconnection between
    heterogeneous networks that support both electrical and biochemical domains (bio-cyber
    interface issues) [1]. B) The convergence of pervasive healthcare systems and
    smart environment systems [82]. This is the result of a home-centered paradigm
    in healthcare services. The increasing integration of smartphones and IoT healthcare
    solutions [29, 39] could lead to more convergence between both environments as
    smartphones play an important role in the everyday lives of a large proportion
    of the population. Based on our review of existing literature in FSC, we identify
    future research trends. The challenges and trends include: A) The use of machine
    learning algorithms to develop valuable prediction models [71] and to better overcome
    specific FSC constraints (such as decentralized and heterogeneous supply vs. unpredictable
    demand changes resulting in 8.3% of worldwide out of stock rate [71]) and thus
    increase reliability of IoT-based applications such as shelf-life prediction or
    precision agriculture [74] or real-time pricing mechanism [71]. B) The use of
    sophisticated sensors that could reliably record relevant information (e.g., for
    liquid products and bulk products). Such sensors could benefit from technological
    advancements in isotope analysis, DNA barcoding, chemometrics, infrared spectroscopy
    (Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and Raman
    spectroscopy [6, 26]. However, those technologies are still in testing phases
    or are too expansive to be easily adopted by FSC stakeholders [6]. According to
    Ref. [26], with the current state of research, spatially offset Raman spectroscopy
    (SORS) seems to be the most convenient solution (rapid, user-friendly, already
    portable devices) to analyze food (thanks to its ability to collect chemically
    rich information through barriers or packaging) and so to expand the portfolio
    of sensors in IoT-based FSC applications. In the mining and energy industries:
    The development of simple routing protocols could result in both decreased computational
    complexity and power consumption. Hence the end goal is to increase the network
    lifetime while implementing a more reliable and energy-efficient communication
    model [2]. In the intelligent transportation industry: A) The implementation of
    expensive multiple radio interfaces may slow down the deployment of IoT-based
    applications in connected cars. Future research could focus on low cost unified
    solution and better adoption rate [61]; B) Research highlights vehicular cloud
    benefits [30, 110]. Future research could address the gap between theoretical
    frameworks and large-scale implementations. In building and infrastructure management:
    Reliable and efficient routing protocols enable implementation of IoT-based applications
    for emergency response. Ref. [81] proposes a routing protocol for IoT-based Emergency
    Response with Global Information Decision (ERGID). It enhances real-time response
    capability of the network by improving data transmission (less end-to-end delay
    and packet loss) while reducing power consumption. These trends for IoT-based
    applications in high-risk EHS industry incur evolving technical challenges in
    the information system, specifically those in communication (e.g., routing issues)
    and processing capabilities (especially for more predictive applications). Nevertheless,
    some future trends allow the possibility for novel solutions, especially in healthcare
    where technology-centric innovations are put forward. Future IoT- and DSS-enabled
    research can be guided to tackle the main challenges in the EHS industry such
    as A) healthcare: security and privacy, standardization, and scalability; B) FSC:
    standardization, interoperability, flexibility, and scalability to develop IoT-based
    applications that encompass the entire supply chain; C) mining and energy industries:
    communication and energy consumption challenges and reliability issues; D) connected
    vehicles: reliable and efficient connectivity and communication are crucial as
    well as security and privacy issues; E) building and infrastructure management:
    interoperability and standardization challenges and privacy issues seem to be
    among the most important issues. 6. Conclusion We provided a comprehensive overview
    of publications on high-risk EHS industries from an IoT-based perspective. Given
    the explosion of IoT-based applications and the significance of high-risk EHS
    industries, it is necessary to take stock of existing studies and results, and
    to identify gaps that can be addressed. The specific focus of our study is the
    high-risk EHS sector: healthcare services, FSC, mining and energy industries (oil
    & gas and nuclear), intelligent transportation, and building and infrastructure
    management with emphasis on emergency response operations. We discussed the motivations
    for existing research on IoT-based applications in high-risk EHS industries. We
    then highlighted specific characteristics of IoT-based applications in these industries:
    architecture design, sensor layer, communication, back-end system and business
    aspects. Concerning IoT-related challenges in high-risk EHS industries, we observe
    that existing research places more emphasis on technical challenges rather than
    social and economical issues. This focus leads to solutions that first tackle
    technical issues. Future research challenges and trends are similar: the main
    focus seems to be dedicated to technical challenges and trends, especially in
    communication and processing capabilities. Both IoT technologies and the EHS industry
    have been developing very rapidly in recent years. We consider only published
    scientific articles. We did not consider trade publications such as magazines
    & newspapers, and patents. Another limitation is the absence of a benchmark for
    reference due to the lack of prior review in this general subject area. We believe
    that this comprehensive review, based on a large number of selected papers, provides
    an informative guidance for future advancement of IoT technologies in the EHS
    industry. References [1] I.F. Akyildiz, M. Pierobon, S. Balasubramaniam, Y. Koucheryavy

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Advances in technology are not only changing the world
    around us but also driving the wireless industry to develop the next generation
    of network technology. There is a lot of buzz building over the advent of 5G that
    will facilitate the entire planet through continuous and ubiquitous communication
    connecting anybody to anything, anywhere, anytime, and anyhow regardless of the
    device, service, network, or geographical existence. 5G will also prove to be
    a paradigm shift including high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, having
    a large number of antennas, and with an extreme base station and device densities.
    In this paper, we investigate the potential beneficiaries of 5G and identify the
    use-cases, where 5G can make an impact. In particular, we consider three main
    use-cases: vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, drones, and healthcare.
    We explore and highlight the problems and deficiencies of current cellular technologies
    with respect to these use-cases and identify how 5G will overcome those deficiencies.
    We also identified the open research problems and provide possible future directions
    to cope with those issues. Topic: Roadmap to 5G: Rising to the Challenge An overview
    of V2X, Drones and Healthcare Use-cases with respect to 5G. Published in: IEEE

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Advances in technology are not only changing the
    world around us but also driving the wireless industry to develop the next generation
    of network technology. Over the last 25 years, mobile technologies such as 1st,
    2nd, 3rd and 4th generation have focused on improving the speed and efficiency
    of wireless networks, but still there are some distinct application areas where
    current wireless networks are struggling to deliver. These areas include V2X communication
    (and particularly Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
    communication), wireless healthcare services, utility applications and industrial
    automation, consumer, virtual and augmented reality services, and primary broadband
    access services etc. [1], [2]. It is expected that the new technologies (5G) will
    investigate the issues within the aforementioned areas and will also address the
    performance criteria for low latency, high speed, enhanced reliability, peak throughput
    per connection, system spectral efficiency, connection and capacity density, and
    low power consumption [3], [4]. It is anticipated that 5G will be the main developmental
    technology that will lead to a step-change in the capability of mobile networks
    particularly around new radio access technology, higher frequencies usage, network
    re-architecting, antenna improvements (beam forming and massive Multiple-Input
    Multiple-Output (MIMO)), ultra-low-latency, and ultra-high reliability. A report
    published by Nokia Communication [5] claims that from 2020 to 2030 there will
    be an increase of 10K times more traffic that needs to be carried out through
    mobile broadband technologies. Such a huge volume of data traffic will lead to
    the design of 5G architectures in a way that will enable deployment in a new and
    higher frequencies band. Some other factors such as ultra-low latency (less than
    one millisecond), reduced power consumption and increased battery life in terms
    of smartphones, tablets and laptops will also be considered in the design of 5G
    architecture. An overview of the key requirements for 5G is summarized in Figure
    1. Based on these requirements, we propose taxonomy of future potential 5G use-cases
    as: (i) Ultra-high reliable use-cases, (ii) Ultra-low latency use-cases and (iii)
    Ultra-reliable and low-latency use-cases. In terms of reliability, we identify
    disaster management using drones, and surveillance operations; in terms of low-latency,
    we explore the automotive industry (with a focus on assisted and autonomous driving),
    augmented/virtual reality, serious gaming, and smart grids; while in terms of
    both reliability and low-latency use-cases, we discuss healthcare and wearables,
    and industry automation. FIGURE 1. Key requirements for 5G communication. Show
    All The main contribution of this survey is to provide the reader with state-of-the-art
    technological trends in terms of 5G communication and highlight the limitations
    and problems of existing cellular technologies. We consider three main future
    use-cases of 5G communication: V2X communication, drones, and healthcare. In terms
    of V2X communication, we present an exhaustive review of the up-to-date research
    progress with respect to V2V, Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), V2I, and Intra-Vehicle
    (IV) communication along with their key application areas. We also identify the
    key limitations of existing technologies in all of these sub-use-cases of V2X
    communication. Similarly, in terms of drones, first we provide an overview of
    single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) deployment, multiple UAV deployment and collision
    avoidance. Then we present some of the key application areas of drones for critical
    infrastructure development using 5G communication. A comparative analysis of control
    latency in terms of 4G and 5G communication is also presented to inform the reader
    of the latest trends. Finally, in terms of healthcare, we mainly consider online
    consultation, online health monitoring, remote diagnosis of time-critical medical
    events and mobile robotic surgeries. Table 1 provides a list of the acronyms and
    their corresponding definitions that have been used throughout the paper. TABLE
    1 Acronym List The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II provides
    a literature review of the existing work. Section III investigates V2X communication,
    Section IV considers drone applications, Section V addresses the healthcare use-case,
    Section VI provide an overview of the open research challenges and future directions,
    while Section VII draws the conclusions. SECTION II. Related Work Masini et al.
    [6] provide an overview of economic motivations, requirements, and enabling technologies
    along with the important international rules and regulations for short-range V2V-based
    vehicular networks and on-board vehicles connectivity respectively. The authors
    mainly concentrated on four different aspects to differentiate their work from
    others in the same area i.e. short-range V2V-based applications, design choices
    and factors for wireless enabling technologies, economic motivations for on-board
    wireless technologies and mandatory international rules for on-board connectivity.
    Similarly, Boban et al. [7] analyzed the requirements and use-cases in terms of
    5G V2X and identified the gaps of the existing communication technologies. The
    authors also provide guidelines on how the existing and 5G technologies will try
    to overcome those gaps. In terms of drone communication, Shakhatreh et al. [8]
    present a survey on the UAV challenges including charging, collision & swarming,
    and network & security with respect to civil applications. The authors highlighted
    different open issues and provide the possible ways of how these issues can be
    approached. Moreover, Li et al. [9] provide an overview of 5G technologies that
    can be incorporated in UAV communication. 5G and UAV integrated architectures
    for space-air-ground scenario were presented and a variety of open research challenges
    were identified. Based on this integration, the authors also provide a state of
    the art overview of the research progress at different layers (physical layer,
    network layer etc.). Furthermore, with respect to healthcare use-case, West [10]
    provides an overview of how 5G differs from earlier generations and highlights
    how 5G will make an impact in healthcare applications. The author investigated
    how 5G will enable new systems of care delivery, and how the application areas
    like imaging, diagnostics, and treatment can be improved through 5G to provide
    quality healthcare facilities to the people. Also, Latif et al. [11] presented
    how 5G and other technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), and big data) will revolutionize healthcare system and provide an overview
    of how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be integrated with healthcare systems
    to detect the anomalies and to ensure that no medical problems has occurred. The
    authors also investigated how remote consultation and remote surgery can be enabled
    through telemedicine and e-health. All of the above and many other surveys discuss
    the overall technological trends and their limitations in terms of V2X, drones
    and healthcare, but none particularly concentrates on limitations of existing
    cellular technologies. Also, in many surveys only a single use-case is discussed
    along with their limitations and future directions, but no survey considered more
    than one use-cases in the same paper. The main purpose of this work is to identify
    limitations of the existing cellular technologies and to provide a possible solution
    for each of these limitations in terms of V2X, drone communication and healthcare.
    Similarly, we consider three main use-cases of 5G communication instead of just
    one use-case. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide a
    comprehensive survey on three main use-cases of 5G in order to identify the problems
    of current technologies and to suggest the possible solutions based on 5G communication.
    SECTION III. Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) Communication According to a report published
    by the U.S. Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
    in [12], 37,461 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2016, an increase
    of 5.6% and 14.4% when compared to 2015 and 2014 respectively. Similarly, according
    to the UK Department for Transport [13], a total of 27,130 people were severely
    injured in road accidents out of which 1,710 lost their lives. On the other hand,
    traffic congestion is investigated by Texas A&M Transportation Institute in a
    report published in [14], and according to their investigation, the total delay
    time will increase to 8.3 billion hours by 2020 resulting a congestion cost of
    almost 192 billion U.S. Dollars. To address these issues, new solutions with high
    reliability and low latency are required that can use the currently available
    resources in an efficient way in order to save lives, reduce congestion and lessen
    the negative impact of transportation on the environment. V2X communication mainly
    refers to the set of standards and technologies that will enable the vehicles
    to interact with the current infrastructure including roads and road users. An
    overall architecture of V2X communication based on 5G technologies is shown in
    Figure 2. These will potentially be based on tested networking protocols and technologies
    rather than relying exclusively on the hardware [15], [16]. Boban et al. [7] proposed
    an architecture for V2X communication based on future 5G technologies. The authors
    claim that the proposed architecture can lead to an accident-free connected automated
    driving and can fulfill the requirements for all V2X use case categories. In the
    following sub-sections, we will elaborate different cases of V2X communication
    with respect to challenges faced in 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and will address
    the absolute solutions enabled by 5G technologies. FIGURE 2. V2X communication
    infrastructure using different technologies. Show All A. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
    Communication Driverless and autonomous cars have increased in popularity because
    of their increased applicability for commercial and emergency services. In order
    to fulfill such services, connected and autonomous cars/vehicles require continuous
    access to sensory data from which the cars can perform advanced trajectory planning
    and complex high-speed maneuvers [17]. For short-term trajectory decisions, the
    car can use on-board sensor information, but for long-term decisions, the car
    needs data and information from vehicles in near proximity. Hence, the exchange
    of sensor data is an important factor that requires a reliable connection between
    vehicles subject to strict quality-of-service (QoS) constraints [18], [19]. According
    to Lu et al. [20], connected vehicles are wireless connectivity-enabled vehicles
    that can communicate with each other and with the infrastructure, establishing
    interactions between vehicle-to-sensor on-board, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-road
    infrastructure, and vehicle-to-internet. Based on these interactions, the vehicles
    can take safe dynamic decisions, can enhance their situational awareness, and
    can provide an information-rich and safer environment to other motorists and/or
    pedestrians. Mavromatis et al. [17] propose a multi-link association scheme for
    millimeter wave (mmWave) V2V communication in order to better utilize the channel
    and to prioritize sharing the sensory data for emergency connected and autonomous
    vehicles (e-CAVs). By using the same method, the authors also address the issue
    of obstacle avoidance maneuvers and advance trajectory planning in terms of e-CAVs
    as compared to regular CAVs (r-CAVs). Also, the Stable Fixtures (SF) matching
    game technique is proposed to formulate a more comprehensive many-to-many link
    association scheme establishing bidirectional links based on unique characteristics
    of each connected vehicles. The SF problem originates from a practical situation,
    where players play against each other in a chess tournament in order to construct
    a set of fixtures having different matches. Each match has two players, and a
    player can be involved in more than one match while fulfilling the condition that
    he/she cannot exceed their stable capacity [21]. Similarly, Chen et al. [22] propose
    rough set theory to formulate the lane-changing rules to enhance the decision-making
    process of autonomous vehicles in a complex urban environment, to reduce the influence
    of week interdependency data and to extract the driver’s decision-making rules.
    The system was designed over a virtual urban traffic environment using Prescan
    simulation software developed for advanced driver assistant systems and intelligent
    vehicle systems [23]. A general overview of the car-changing process is shown
    in Figure 3, where the green car (Car1) is the subject Car that wants to change
    lane, while Car2 and Car3 are the interfering cars. Based on simulation results,
    the authors concluded that the Car1 driver’s decision-making behavior during the
    lane-changing process is subject to the relative distance between the subject
    car and the interfering Car3, and the relative velocity between the subject Car
    and the leading Car2. FIGURE 3. Lane-changing process. Show All Some of the key
    application areas of V2V communication are discussed as follows: V2V communication
    enhances driving safety and traffic efficiency along with information or entertainment
    provision to drivers in a number of use-cases such as traffic safety, traffic
    efficiency, infotainment and payments etc. In terms of traffic safety, V2V communication
    disseminates warning messages on several occasions e.g. entering intersections
    or departing highways, hazardous locations such as reporting accidents ahead,
    and obstacle discovery, forward collision and pre-cash warnings, and favoring
    police cars, fire fighter vehicles, and ambulances [24], [25]. Similarly, in terms
    of traffic efficiency, V2V communication enhances the route guidance and navigation
    system, automating traffic intersection control, optimizing the green light speed,
    and providing information about variable speed limits. This will help to reduce
    traffic congestion and will lead to reduce the energy consumption [24], [26].
    Moreover, infotainment and payment services such as on-board internet access,
    toll collection and parking payment etc. provide comfort services to the vehicle
    owner and also avoid congestion caused by toll collection. B. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian
    (V2P) Communication V2P is one of the most important applications of vehicular
    networks providing safety to pedestrians through wireless communication. Bagheri
    et al. [27] addressed the issue of V2P communication in order to improve the safety
    of pedestrians. The authors proposed a method based on the existing infrastructure
    that enables the development of V2P road safety applications. On pedestrian side,
    3G and LTE were utilized as cellular technologies to provide connectivity to the
    individual’s smartphone, while on vehicular side, an on-board SIM card was used
    for same purpose. In case of any issue with on-board SIM, driver’s smartphone
    was considered as an alternative for connectivity purposes. The proposed adaptive
    multi-level approach was designed based on mobile cloud computing to compute and
    process all the data. Road users including vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists
    send updated messages containing speed, location and direction information to
    the cloud-based server. Two types of safety messages were identified: (i) cooperative
    awareness messages which are time triggered (periodic) beacons that carry position
    information and (ii) decentralized environmental notification messages which are
    event triggered and carry hazard warnings [27], [28]. In situations that are risky
    and may lead to a collision, road users will send updated messages in a periodic
    fashion at 100ms intervals. The authors conclude that their proposed method provides
    a risk-free environment for pedestrians and could also reduce the energy consumption
    of user equipments. Similarly, Rahimian et al. [29] examined how the action of
    a pedestrian engaged in composing or reading an SMS can be influenced by sending
    mobile device warnings when approaching to an unsafe road crossing. The authors
    specifically assess the effects of texting on pedestrian road crossing behavior
    and the effectiveness of those warnings in reducing unsafe road crossing. They
    project that texting reduces pedestrian awareness of traffic and prejudices their
    road-crossing decision-making. Warning alarms help redirect their attention towards
    traffic and also reduce the probability of risky road crossing and collision.
    The authors use an approach entitled “Between-subjects design” considering three
    different types of conditions: (i) texting, (ii) warning, and (iii) control. In
    terms of texting, the participants continuously receive and respond to the text
    messages during the entire road-crossing session, while in the case of warning,
    the participants also receive an auditory alarm from a cell phone when they enter
    to a situation that is classified as unsafe. In the control condition, the participants
    neither receive any text nor respond to any message but hold the smartphone during
    the entire road-crossing session. The authors conclude that the proposed technique
    improves road-crossing decisions of pedestrians which are busy in text messages.
    They also indicate that further investigation is required in situations when the
    participants receive the warning messages, but fail to respond to those messages,
    and continue to cross roads in an unsafe manner [29]. Moreover, Coeugnet et al.
    [30] assessed the performance and effectiveness of a vibrotactile wristband device
    by helping older pedestrians in safer street-crossing decisions. The study was
    conducted in a simulated two-way traffic environment with a street-crossing task
    where twenty younger-old (age 60-70), twenty older-old (age 70-80), and 17 younger
    adults (age 20-45) with and without a vibrotactile wristband participated. The
    test was run on a virtual platform to check the device’s ability to accurately
    emulate all the required communication between the vehicle, infrastructure and
    pedestrian. The authors claim that the haptic device partly compensates for some
    age-related gap-acceptance difficulties and reduces the street-crossing risks
    for all users. They also conjecture that the device will be beneficial for all
    ages but particularly for older participants and specifically for older women
    who have difficulties in street-crossing. The device also helps to reduce the
    number of decisions that may lead to collisions in situations when vehicles approach
    rapidly [30].The authors advise some educational and training programs by using
    virtual reality tools to educate pedestrians about their vulnerabilities and how
    to cope with those in order to reduce crash statistics [31]–[33]. C. Vehicle-To-Infrastructure
    (V2I) Communication Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is basically a communication
    model that allows a vehicle to share information with roadside components such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers and cameras, traffic lights,
    lane markers, streetlights and parking meters etc. V2I is a bidirectional wireless
    communication where data is transferred from infrastructure to vehicle and vice
    versa over an ad hoc network [34]. According to Péter et al. [24], some of the
    key components for a minimal V2I system should contain: Vehicle on-board unit
    (OBU), Roadside Unit (RSU), and a safe communication channel. OBU is comprised
    of a radio transceiver such as a dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) system,
    a GPS system and a processor and facilitates communication between the vehicles
    and RSUs and other vehicles in the near proximity. RSUs are composed of the same
    radio transceiver i.e. DSRC, an application processor and an interface to the
    V2I communication network. These are usually mounted on interchanges, intersections,
    and patrol stations. RSUs are mainly responsible for private data transfer and
    message prioritization management to and from the vehicle. Messages are prioritized
    based on their criticality - local and V2V safety applications have the highest
    priority, public and private network applications have lower priority, while entertainment
    messages have the lowest priority [24]. Similarly, Ndashimye et al. [35] conducted
    an extensive survey on the effectiveness of V2I communication in the context of
    5G networks that supports the co-existence of multi-tier heterogeneous wireless
    networks with various radio access technologies (RATs). The authors initially
    studied the V2I communication standards such as DSRC derived from the 802.x family,
    Wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), and LTE-A. DSRC uses a licensed
    spectrum at 5.9 GHz with seven channels of 10 MHz bandwidth (5.850-5.925). Out
    of the seven channels, the control channel in the center is dedicated for safety
    applications, two at the end are reserved for special purposes, while the rest
    are the service channels available for both safety and non-safety applications
    [36], [37]. WAVE or IEEE802.11p integrate both the MAC and physical layer, use
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in order to divide the signal
    into multiple narrowband signals and define two classes of devices: OBU and RSU
    [36]. The authors also mention some of the key application areas of V2I such as
    traffic efficiency and management, entertainment and personalized applications
    and safety-related applications. The primary focus of the study is V2I safety
    applications that may lead to either reducing or even avoiding crashes by increasing
    driver awareness via different warning messages wirelessly communicated between
    vehicles and roadside infrastructure [35]. Some of the key recommendations from
    the proposed studies are: (i) efficient network discovery, (ii) underlying network
    selection, (iii) seamless and reliable vertical handover, (iv) QoS requirements,
    (v) dissemination of data, (vi) security and (vii) an upper layer communication
    protocol suite in order to support seamless vertical handover in 5G heterogeneous
    network environments. Moreover, Ndashimye et al. [38] propose a network selection
    method that applies the knowledge of mobility data and network load information
    in order to carry out an effective handover for V2I communication over multi-tier
    heterogeneous networks. Some of the key parameters such as relative direction
    index, residence time index, proximity index, and network load index are identified
    in order to select the best candidate network for vehicle with a judicious coverage.
    The algorithms were tested in an OPNET simulator by developing a dual mode vehicle
    OBU fortified with both Wi-Fi and LTE-A cards in order to evaluate and validate
    the proposed system model. The performance of the proposed model was compared
    with the conventional method and access network discovery and selection function-assisted
    handover methods. The authors concluded that the proposed approach can reduce
    the unnecessary handover up to 50%, mean handover latency up to 40%, higher throughput
    up to 50% and lower end-to-end delay up to 43% with respect to the conventional
    handover method. D. Intra-Vehicle (IV) Communication Wireless interconnections
    between sensors and other devices within the vehicle, such as sensors for detecting
    road conditions and driver’s fatigue, monitoring tire pressure and water temperature
    in the cooling system and advanced sensors for autonomous control are currently
    being investigated [20], [39]. Along with these, a number of other sensors and
    processors such as Antilock Braking Systems and Electronic Stability Control monitor
    a vehicle’s internal performance and dynamics, while camera, radar, and ultrasonic
    sensors sense the environment around the vehicle and keep the driver up to-date
    with his surroundings. Tuohy et al. [39] explore the physical layer technologies
    for Next Generation Ethernet networks with some middleware technologies in terms
    of automotive industries. They also categorize automotive network traffic and
    classify it with respect to control data, safety data, infotainment data and driver
    assistance cameras. Control data is further divided into low-bandwidth control
    applications and real-time control applications. Systems that control non-safety
    critical aspects of the vehicle such as electronically controlled mirrors and
    seats fall into the category of low-bandwidth control applications, while suspension
    and braking systems, ABS and traction control lie under real-time control applications.
    Safety data assists drivers by using the built-in driver safety systems such as
    adaptive cruise control, parking sensors and night-time pedestrian detection infrared
    sensors. GPS, audio and visual entertainment, and on-board internet facilities
    fall into the category of infotainment data that encompasses all the traffic related
    to entertainment and driver information systems within the vehicle. Finally, the
    driver assistance cameras assist the drivers while reversing and lane departing
    [39]. The authors conclude their discussion by suggesting the standardization
    of approaches across the industries, allowing manufacturers to focus on new innovations
    based on existing applications. Similarly, Saed et al. [40] address the security
    issues in intra-inter vehicle communication networks. In terms of intra-vehicle
    communication, the authors suggest that data transmission between the vehicle’s
    Electronic Control Units through a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol should
    be protected. The research was carried out to present some background study into
    the specifics of CAN applications. Some of the key issues such as boot loader,
    privacy, operating system level issues, application specific issues and communication
    related issues with respect to security not only in today’s vehicles but also
    in the future vehicles were focused. Promises of security improvements for future
    vehicles are also suggested such as adopting IPV6 in the vehicle communication
    protocol, behavioral privacy, cross-domain security, use of public key infrastructure,
    resolving privacy concerns with respect to customer information, implementing
    a robust security approach for the vehicle communication and last but not least
    addressing all the newly identified vulnerabilities by constant monitoring and
    tracking [40]. E. Challenges of Existing Communication Technologies and Solutions
    Some of the major standardized technologies that are currently being considered
    for V2X communication are: IEEE802.11p/DSRC and its extension IEEE802.11px, 3rd
    generation partnership project (3GPP)’s Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) Pro
    and millimeter-wave (mmWave) [41], [42]. Further detail about each of these technology
    with respect to its pros and cons is provided below. 1) IEEE802.11p/DSRC and IEEE802.11px
    The IEEE802.11p/DSRC standard incorporates the suite of IEEE802.11s and IEEEP1609.x
    standards (with some modifications), operating in a frequency range of 5.850 GHz
    to 5.925 GHz. Having a decentralized architecture, the Physical (PHY) layer of
    the protocol is based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), while
    the MAC layer is based on Enhanced Distributed Channel Access protocol having
    Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance and four different access
    categories to the medium that supports different QoS profiles and prioritizes
    data traffic [41], [42]. Due to a direct communication between the source and
    destination endpoints, the protocol can operate without network coverage in a
    fully distributed manner. These endpoints start communication without forming
    a Basic Service Set that allows vehicles to effectively and immediately transmit
    data. The protocol spectrum is divided into seven channels each of 10 MHz bandwidth,
    where the control channel is specifically reserved for broadcasting safety and
    mission critical messages, while the remaining six channels can be used for all
    other applications [42]. Due to the adopted MAC contention based medium access
    strategy, the IEEE802.11p/DSRC throughput and end-to-end delay performance degrades
    quickly as the network load increases. The main reason behind this degradation
    is the lack of coordination between the devices and the use of a “listen before
    talk” mechanism. Based on these assumptions, the protocol may only be suitable
    for transferring low bitrate data streams in vehicular environments. Another drawback
    of IEEE802.11p/DSRC is that its communication range typically extends to several
    100s of meters and that may not be applicable to some V2X applications where a
    reliable transmission beyond this communication range is required [41]. Efficient
    utilization of the allocated spectrum for mission critical applications and safety
    purposes in 5.9 GHz frequency band is another drawback of IEEE802.11p/DSRC. According
    to Mavromatis et al. [42], to overcome the deficiencies of IEEE02.11p/DSRC, an
    enhanced version of the protocol in terms of IEEE802.11px is launched based on
    a Space Time Block Coding mechanism that can increase the performance under noisy
    channel transmissions and can improve the packet delivery rate by 40% as compared
    to IEEE802.11p. Also, the new protocol is expected to provide MIMO antenna capabilities
    with improved OFDM layouts, and very high throughput frame by enhancing the channel
    capacity by a factor of 10 [42]. 2) 3GPP LTE-Advanced Pro The next level of communication
    is to bypass the existing infrastructure and transfer data directly between the
    users. It’s basically the next generation of Device-to-Device (D2D) communication
    where an infrastructure independent communication will be offered with significantly
    lower delay performance. LTE and LTE-A Pro, represents the next generation of
    5G cellular communication standards defined by 3GPP in order to provide high data
    rates, pervasive coverage, enhanced connectivity for end-users regardless of the
    geographical location and environment. Public Land Mobile Network facilitates
    cellular radio coverage to vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians
    and cyclists based on 3GPP LTE standard also known as Evolved Universal Terrestrial
    Access Network and can exploit the existing infrastructure for V2X communication
    [41], [42]. LTE was originally designed for mobile broadband (MBB) services; hence
    it has many limitations with respect to V2X communication. Some of those limitations
    are listed as follows based on [41]: Latency increases as the number of users
    in a cell increases, and to maintain a latency below 200ms, event-triggered messages
    should be limited from 100 to 150 devices in rural and urban environments respectively.
    A single data packet between two vehicles needs to traverse the entire network
    rather than a direct transfer link between the source and destination. This may
    lead to a higher delay and sometimes a point of failure for the infrastructure.
    LTE will not be an optimal solution for transmitting small chunks of data as it
    was originally designed for broadband services. Transmission of these small packets
    of data may lead to problems such as channel coding, control and channel estimation
    overhead and resource granularity. As LTE is an infrastructure-based approach,
    it may be difficult to satisfy the coverage requirements in tunnels, mountainous
    territories, underground parking and rural areas etc. which are basically the
    most vulnerable places for road-users. To overcome these limitations, the current
    release of LTE-A Pro is designed in such a way that can fulfill almost all the
    requirements for public safety and commercial consumer applications such as higher
    mobility and long-distance coverage, enhanced QoS, and multicast communication.
    Similarly, the downlink and uplink access technologies are based on OFDMA and
    Single Carrier (SC-FDMA) respectively, so frequency-time resource scheduling is
    guaranteed with higher flexibility and efficiency. Even with dynamic propagation
    environments and higher mobility speeds, significant spectral efficiency can be
    obtained based on advanced MIMO capabilities. Also, having multicast/broadcast
    capabilities, LTE-A Pro can fully support vehicular service message broadcasting
    in cross traffic assistance applications. With such mature capabilities, LTE-A
    Pro still has limitations in terms of latency [43], [44]. The maximum achievable
    latency in end-to-end communication can be as high as 80ms, which is not sufficient
    to support tactile-like communication that requires a latency of less than 10ms.
    Similarly, terminals need to re-establish a connection with the base station after
    an idle state costing a latency of almost 110ms for additional link establishment,
    which again promotes severe performance degradation and may not be usable in safety-critical
    applications [45]. 3) Millimeter Wave (mmWave) The next generation of 5G cellular
    systems will have mmWave technology and systems that will be based on this technology
    will play an important role in 5G communication. mmWave operates in the spectrum
    between 30GHz and 300GHz, while the carrier frequencies are spread around 60GHz
    with a channelisation of 2.16GHz. Through beamforming technologies, mmWave will
    achieve high array gains by implementing large antenna arrays that will help the
    system to achieve higher data rates typically up to several gigabits-per-second
    [42], [46]. IEEE802.11ad which is basically a protocol stack for mmWave will ensure
    a data-rate of 7Gbps with an end-to-end latency of less than 10ms. Also, under
    ideal propagation conditions, mmWave systems outperforms IEEE802.11p/DSRC and
    LTE/LTE-A Pro standards in terms of V2X communication [47]. A summary of all these
    features along with some additional capabilities of the above mentioned technologies
    is given in Table 2 based on [42]. TABLE 2 Candidate Technologies for V2X Communication
    SECTION IV. Drones Wireless networks comprising of Drones/UAVs can provide on-the-fly
    communication facilities in a cost-effective way in situations where part of the
    existing terrestrial infrastructure is destroyed and there is a need to provide
    emergency services and avoid any further destruction in the disaster-struck areas
    [48], [49]. In most cases, UAVs are only used for military purposes, but when
    they are equipped with small access points/routers, they can provide a communication
    bridge between ground users and network nodes. Similarly, UAVs can be used in
    package delivery, surveillance operations and IoT applications. Surveillance operations
    usually involve monitoring the areas of interest over a long period of time. Such
    operations may include search and rescue operations, border patrol and traffic
    monitoring, fire monitoring and many more [49], [50]. A. Single UAV Deployment
    Single UAV deployment is a simple scenario where a UAV tries to bridge communication
    between two static nodes on the ground. Kwon and Hailes [51] proposed a greedy
    search algorithm in order to search the area for node discovery and to achieve
    optimum communication between the participating nodes. The optimal position of
    a UAV is identified based on balanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), throughput,
    and bit error rate. SNR and throughput are used as input variables and based on
    these variables the proportional-integral-derivative controller decides the next
    waypoint of the UAV. The authors concluded that based on SNR and throughput, the
    algorithm can calculate the most advantageous position of the UAV where all the
    participating nodes can be served at the same time. Similarly, several algorithms
    have been developed in order to connect a disjoint group of nodes using a single
    UAV. Heimfarth and de Araujo [52] presented a method for connecting a disjoint
    group of wireless sensor networks with the help of a UAV for the purpose of carrying
    messages. The authors used the UAV as a data mule, where the UAV physically transmits
    the packets to the entire network. Initially the network was partitioned into
    different segments and a cluster head election was done in order to elect a cluster
    head for each group of nodes. The cluster head is the node that is responsible
    for communicating and exchanging data with UAV. The authors proposed a separate
    algorithm for the cluster head election process. Within a segment, geographic
    routing was used to route the packets and was termed as intra-segment message
    relay. For inter-segment message relays where the packets need to be transferred
    from one segment to another, the UAV visits each cluster head for collecting data
    and delivering it to the required destination. The authors performed different
    simulations and concluded that the system is capable of maintaining communication
    between the group of nodes with a low packet rate for a moderate set of traffic.
    Two different cases were considered for simulation purpose having an area of 4
    and 9 km2 respectively. 6 & 9 segments with 60 nodes per segment using a single
    UAV with a speed of 60 km/h having a buffer size of 200-400 packets was considered
    for the same set of simulation. Heimfarth and de Araujo [52] also noticed a bigger
    latency in the case of a huge deployment area. An intelligent hierarchical state
    routing algorithm (IHSR) was proposed in order to reduce the system latency because
    of long propagation delays of UAVs as well as to improve the throughput [53].
    The hierarchical infrastructure of a heterogeneous ad-hoc wireless network with
    UAVs consisted of 2 levels i.e. ground ad-hoc wireless network, and ground embedded
    mobile backbone network. IHSR first divides the entire network into clusters where
    each cluster has its own cluster head and cluster internal nodes (cluster members).
    Logical addresses were introduced in IHSR in order to manage the mobility in a
    better way. For route discovery, link state messages or invitation messages were
    exchanged locally and globally through neighbor cluster heads and UAV broadcasts.
    In respond to an invitation message, each lower level node sends a registration
    message to the cluster head where the cluster head stores it in its INtable. Gu
    et al. [53] verified their algorithm through different simulations and concluded
    that the proposed system improved the throughput for link state routing through
    UAV broadcasts instead of flooding. Moreover, different mobility models for ad-hoc
    network were studied by Camp et al. [54]. The authors categorized the movement
    of mobile nodes in two different models i.e. Entity mobility models, and Group
    mobility models. In entity mobility models, the movement of mobile nodes are independent
    of each other, while in group mobility models, the movement of mobile nodes are
    dependent on each other. B. Multiple UAV Deployment Complex situations occur when
    a single UAV is unable to cover a group of nodes in a specific mission. Multiple
    UAVs are used in such cases in order to cover a set of nodes in a bounded region.
    A cooperative distributed planning algorithm termed as the consensus based bundle
    algorithm (CBBA) was proposed by Ponda et al. [55] in order to ensure network
    connectivity with limited communication facilities for a group of heterogeneous
    agents operating in a dynamic environment. The algorithm improves the entire mission
    performance and also extend the range of a team. CBBA use the free agents as relays
    for maintaining connectivity between the base station and UAVs during the task
    execution. The authors validated the performance of CBBA through simulation results
    as well as field tests and, based on those results they concluded that CBBA is
    well suited for real time applications. Similarly, Palat et al. [56] studied the
    application of distributed MIMO schemes on multiple UAVs as communication relays
    for range and reliability improvement of ground based ad-hoc networks. The authors
    used different simulation parameters to verify the performance of both MIMO and
    orthogonal space-time block codes techniques under ideal and non-ideal conditions.
    In the case of lower carrier frequencies, better performance can be achieved in
    terms of distributed beamforming. Also, in the case of multi-hop relaying based
    on swarm of UAVs, the range and reliability of ad-hoc networks can be improved.
    C. Collision Avoidance in the Case of Multiple UAVs Collision avoidance is another
    important issue that must be addressed in the presence of multiple UAVs. Li et
    al. [57] have evaluated a number of collision avoidance algorithms such as collision
    cone, geometric collision cones, simulated annealing, inverse proportional navigation,
    artificial potential fields, and dynamic sparse A-Star (A*). The authors verified
    the evaluation process by implementing and simulating the aforementioned algorithms
    on a common infrastructure, and also addressed the strength and weaknesses of
    each approach. Collision cone and geometric collision cone algorithms works on
    the concept of relative velocities of all UAVs generating a collision cone. A
    minimum distance between two UAVs was calculated based on the relative velocities
    and concluded that if the relative velocity is greater than a specified degree
    of angle, then the UAVs are moving away and there is no threat of collision. On
    the other hand, if both the UAVs are inside the cone and their relative velocities
    are less than the specified degree of angle, a threat of collision is there. In
    that case, the relative velocities of UAVs need to be changed in order to rectify
    the possible collision. Moreover, if both the velocities are same, then there
    is a need to deviate the UAV from their original path, because they are approaching
    towards each other and there is a possibility of entering into the threat zone.
    In simulated annealing, there are three main steps i.e. clustering the UAVs, establishing
    a cost function, and minimizing the cost function. In step one, the UAVs are clustered
    into groups based on their threats. Also, a minimum distance between two UAVs
    where the UAVs can still avoid the collision is calculated and this particular
    area is termed as danger zone. If there is no threat in the danger zone, the UAV
    can safely continue towards its goal. A cost function is then established where
    the UAVs will be instructed regarding how much they will turn in order to change
    the velocity and to avoid collision. This cost function is then minimized based
    on certain parameters such as energy level of the current state, and random neighboring
    state for new solution. Li et al. [57] concluded that the neighbor can become
    a new solution only if the energy level is less than the current solution, or
    if the probability function designates it as the new solution. D. Drone Applications
    Using 5G Lin et al. [58] performed field measurements for data collection during
    drone flights connected to the commercial LTE network. They also performed some
    simulations in order to study the performance of network in terms of serving many
    drones simultaneously over a wide area. The main purpose of this study was to
    analyze the applicability and performance of mobile network connectivity to low
    altitude drones. Lin et al. [58] conclude that the current mobile LTE network
    can support the initial deployment of low altitude drones, but they are still
    facing some issues with respect to interference and mobility that can be addressed
    by the next generation of 5G networks by providing more efficient connectivity
    for wide-scale drone deployment. Similarly, Luo et al. [59] highlight the communication
    and network technologies that can contribute to UAV disaster management systems
    in situations including early warning system, search and rescue, data gathering,
    provision of network coverage in emergency communication and logistic delivery.
    The authors also address the networking technologies that are essential for UAV
    deployment in practical environments in the context of disaster management and
    response. A universal network architecture based on 802.11 Wi-Fi network, 2G/3G/4G
    cellular network, UAV ad-hoc network and satellite network was proposed as shown
    in Figure 4. FIGURE 4. UAV-based disaster management. Show All Design considerations
    and challenges such as bandwidth consumption, transmission latency and disruption
    of UAV-based wireless network for disaster management were also studied. In terms
    of bandwidth consumption, strict bandwidth requirements must be fulfilled especially
    for online applications such as real-time monitoring. In addition to real-time
    monitoring, 4K or even 8K videos captured during aerial monitoring applications
    require a much higher bandwidth. Such a higher bandwidth can be ensured by the
    next generation of 5G communication. Latency is another important aspect in the
    design of system components and network protocols. For real-time visual and audio
    data transfer in the context of aerial communication, latency should not be more
    than 50-100ms. Similarly, for surveillance, such as border or highway patrolling,
    the latency should not be more than 3ms. Luo et al. [59] also address the design
    considerations and challenges such as channel modeling, antenna structure design,
    UAV cooperation, advanced data analytics, path planning, and energy efficiency
    etc. of a UAV-based ad-hoc network for disaster management. Moreover, Huo et al.
    [60] present a comprehensive review of the current developments made in three
    categories of UAV-enabled next generation wireless communications. In the first
    phase, a multi-layer distributed UAV-enabled 5G network is proposed, where the
    architecture is more flexible, hierarchical and supports scenario driven reconfigurations.
    In the second phase, several performance enhancement enablers are identified and
    evaluated for UAV-enabled 5G wireless communications. Furthermore, Naqvi et al.
    [48] focus on different UAV-enabled 5G communication paradigms such as deployment
    issues related to energy efficiency etc. In this regard, the work investigates
    the compatibility of UAVs with traditional wireless networks to achieve energy
    efficient high data rates for 5G communications. Moreover, the article proposes
    a UAV-based routing protocol for disaster-resilient infrastructure. A case study
    is presented based on a UAV that is incorporated in a wireless network in both
    low and high-power base stations operating at different frequencies. The study
    concludes that the incorporation of UAVs will increase the performance of the
    heterogeneous network in terms of network coverage and data rate. Similarly, He
    et al. [61] discussed the security aspects of UAV-enabled 5G communication for
    public safety networks. Using UAVs in such a critical network infrastructure may
    pose cybersecurity threats to the personal information of the individuals involved.
    If UAV-enabled communication is not made secure, this will reduce the applicability
    and usability of such networks. The authors claim that UAV-enabled communication
    networks suffer from issues like unauthorized access, malicious control, or other
    cybersecurity attacks. He et al. [61] emphasize the need for communication security
    schemes to be incorporated in such critical networks to secure personal information.
    Shakhatreh et al. [8] performed a comprehensive survey on UAV civil applications
    with their key challenges. The main purpose of the study was to present the worldwide
    UAV payload market value and to provide a classification of UAVs based on certain
    factors such as endurance, weight, coverage range, maximum altitude, and its applications.
    The authors also discussed the civil applications of UAVs in a number of key areas
    including real-time monitoring of road traffic, security and surveillance, precision
    agriculture, provision of civil infrastructure, search and rescue operations,
    and delivery of goods along with their key challenges. Additionally, Fotouhi et
    al. [62] proposed a novel Drone-Cells scenario where the drones within a cell
    persistently move in order to serve the users from a closer distance for the sake
    of improving the spectral efficiency of the network along with the quality of
    service of the cell-edge users. Three different mobility control algorithms with
    erratic complexity and performance were used to check the efficiency of DroneCells
    scenario. Based on the simulation results, the authors claimed 34% improvement
    in terms of spectral efficiency and a 50% increase in the 5th-percentile packet
    throughput as compared to drone hover over some fixed locations. Fotouhi et al.
    [62] also assured that such kind of results can be obtained with minimal drone
    speeds in order to avoid any negative effect on drone battery lifetime. Likewise,
    Zeng et al. [63] provide an overview of the emerging technologies with their potential
    benefits, communication and spectrum requirements, along with proposing some new
    design considerations with respect to the next generation of three-dimensional
    heterogeneous wireless networks. Based on the proposed cellular-connected UAV
    technology as shown in Figure 5, new wireless technologies can be developed that
    will enable significantly enhanced UAV-ground communications. Several appealing
    advantages of cellular-connected UAVs such as ubiquitous accessibility, enhanced
    performance, ease of monitoring and management, robust navigation, and cost effectiveness
    were also highlighted. In terms of new design considerations, the authors explored
    3D coverage, unique channel characteristics, severe aerial-ground interference,
    and asymmetric uplink/downlink traffic requirements. Similarly, in terms of promising
    technologies that can effectively enable future wireless systems, the authors
    investigated 3D beamforming, multi-cell cooperation, and ground-aerial non-orthogonal
    multiple access. Finally, Zeng et al. [63] outlined some future directions such
    as quality of service aware trajectory design, millimeter wave cellular-connected
    UAV, and cellular-connected UAV swarm. FIGURE 5. An overview of cellular-connected
    UAVs representing different use-cases. Show All In similar manner, Zhang et al.
    [64] studied the PHY layer security in UAV communication to address the two critical
    issues i.e. the achievable secrecy rate between the legitimate transmitter and
    intended receiver will be limited as compare to the rate between the legitimate
    transmitter and eavesdropper, even in the presence of power control, artificial
    noise, cooperative jamming, and multi-antenna beamforming techniques. Secondly,
    since the eavesdropper is a passive device, it is quite difficult to estimate
    the channel state information of the eavesdropper that is usually required to
    a legitimate transmitter. For simplicity, the authors considered a single UAV
    that is deployed to send the confidential information to a fixed position-based
    legitimate receiver in the presence of a fixed position-based eavesdropper. The
    main purpose of the study was to maximize the average secrecy rate of the UAV
    by jointly designing the UAV trajectory and transmit power control subject to
    different constraints such as average and peak transmit power, UAV mobility with
    its maximum speed, and initial and final UAV locations. Based on the proposed
    efficient iterative algorithm, the authors concluded that the algorithm can expressively
    improve the physical layer security performance of the UAV communication system.
    E. Comparative Analysis of Control Latency in Terms of 4G and 5G In this section
    we elaborate on the control latency that is currently offered by different cellular
    technologies for mission critical infrastructures using drones and how 5G will
    help to reduce that latency. Also, we discuss some of the capabilities that 5G
    is offering for drones. Yang et al. [65] performed some field experiments in order
    to gain insights into the capabilities of 4G networks for connected drones. The
    results were collected at 2.6GHz carrier frequency with 20MHz carrier bandwidth
    using LTE-Advance network. Latency performance of the proposed network was calculated
    at three different heights i.e. 50m, 100m, and 300m. The results illustrate that
    most of the latency data samples are concentrated between 200ms and 300ms at a
    height of 50 and 100m respectively, while at 300m height, the latency data samples
    are more inclined towards 400 to 500ms. Based on the latency samples, it can be
    suggested that without further enhancements the current LTE-A network might have
    difficulties in serving drone applications with rigorous latency requirements.
    Yang et al. [65] conclude that the more powerful capabilities of the next generation
    of 5G networks can address the coverage, data rate, and latency issues of the
    existing technologies and can fulfill the objectives of the connected drones in
    mission critical infrastructures. The improved capabilities of 5G networks may
    include coverage enhancements and high data rates, service differentiation and
    QoS enhancements, and detection and resource management. Some of the key characteristics
    of cellular communication technologies with respect to disaster management are
    summarized in Table 3 [59]. TABLE 3 Characteristics of Cellular Technologies in
    Disaster Management Using Drones SECTION V. Healthcare With the increase in the
    world’s adult population [66], there is an increasing requirement for treatment
    and assistance in emergency healthcare situations. This has emphasized the need
    for technological advancements in healthcare to provide efficient and affordable
    solutions to an increasing number of patients. Kumar et al. [67] identified the
    important features that a mobile healthcare system should possess. Such a system
    should be able to (i) handle emergency cases using tele-medicine facilities, (ii)
    provide tele-medicine unit to a doctor in order to enhance intensive healthcare
    provision and (iii) allow the installation of a tele-monitoring system at patient’s
    home while the monitoring station is based in the doctor’s office. Alemdar and
    Ersoy [68] provide a survey of healthcare applications that deploy wireless sensor
    networks such as movement tracking, medication intake tracking and daily activity
    monitoring. The authors emphasize that there are several limitations that currently
    exist in current technologies that can be overcome by adopting 5G networks to
    make healthcare remotely accessible. Soldani et al. [69] propose a framework that
    can be deployed on mobile devices, offering functionality for collecting, processing
    and storing information to support identification of abnormal events. The development
    of 4G technologies enabled the advent of a range of tele-medicine applications
    such as remote consultation, remote surgery and patient monitoring. Kumar et al.
    [67] also discuss limitations of existing technologies (i.e. lack of flexible
    and compatible tele-medical links due to high hardware and operational costs,
    data transfer rates and latency) that will need to be addressed in future technologies
    such as 5G. When deploying the next generation of networks, the main factors that
    should be addressed are security, seamless integration, QoS and streaming and
    compression issues. It is expected that the advent of 5G technologies will play
    an active part in providing patient-oriented healthcare applications which can
    be easily managed by the patient or the carer. It is expected that 5G networks
    would carry a significantly higher volume of data while maintaining reliability
    [70], [71]. The critical requirement for 5G networks is ultra-low latency which
    will allow the deployment of mission critical applications such as tele-consulting,
    tele-surgery etc. Kim et al. [72] highlight that in order to achieve interdisciplinary
    collaboration between medical services and technology, there are a few requirements
    to be met. These include (i) sensors that are ultra sensitive and small enough
    to be embedded into the patient’s body, (ii) ultra reliable low latency communications
    infrastructure which can transmit large amounts of audio, video and haptic feedback
    data with very little delay; and (iii) standardized haptic interfaces such as
    surgical robots etc. that will possibly increase the type of applications where
    such technologies can be deployed. Figure 6 represents an infrastructure model
    for a tele-medicine system which consists of an operator with an interface at
    the controller end connected to a remotely controlled domain via a 5G cellular
    network. FIGURE 6. A representation of a tele-medicine infrastructure using 5G
    network. Show All De Mattos and Gondim [73] discuss the requirements for implementing
    mobile health applications (m-health) using 5G networks and the capabilities of
    5G communication that are important for m-health applications. The authors identified
    some of the significant features such as very low latency, bandwidth, scalability,
    high network capacity, large number of sensory devices, long battery lifetime,
    reliability, resilience and security that 5G networks require for m-health applications.
    Chen et al. [70] and Thuemmler et al. [74] discuss the various technical specifications
    relevant to healthcare such as network design approaches and paradigms. The various
    aspects discussed range from the types of data sources available from the healthcare
    domain, to the techniques required to perform the necessary data processing and
    network resource management techniques. Thuemmler et al. [74] discuss the network
    spectrum required for tele-medicine applications and the interoperability requirements
    when setting up a tele-medicine infrastructure. References [10] and [75]–[77]
    refer to IoT devices used for healthcare applications as Internet of Medical Things
    (IoMT) which requires high data and speed capacity and a long operation time over
    a reliable network with very low transmission delay. Brito [78] provides a survey
    of the various technological trends in the realm of 5G networks and various IoMT
    applications and the requirements of 5G networks for the deployment of these systems.
    West [10] discusses the capabilities of 5G as compared to existing networks to
    deploy cyber-physical healthcare systems and could allow for implementation of
    healthcare applications such as online consultation, diagnosis and remote surgery
    applications. The following sub-sections go into further details of the popular
    healthcare applications available which could benefit from incorporating 5G networks
    for communication [76], [79]. A. Online Consultation 5G technology with IoMT,
    big data analysis and ML techniques will allow for enhancements in healthcare
    applications [11]. The incorportaion of sensors as part of IoMT and 5G network
    to monitor vitals and other health related data will allow patients (at home)
    to monitor themselves and transmit the data to the health expert at a remote location
    (i.e. hospital) for a real-time online consultation. Caric et al. [80] identify
    the advantages of using online consultation and also propose a platform for online
    consultations. They emphasize that the online consultation can provide better
    regulatory governance which would ensure transparency in the regulatory environment.
    They highlight the drawbacks of current online consultation systems which lack
    coordinated information exchange. They do emphasize that the existing global communication
    network provides an opportunity to construct a communication platform for online
    consultations where ordinary citizens, experts, different civic and business associations
    and executive bodies could contribute and exchange information using mainly standard
    internet connectivity [80]. Segura-Sampedro et al. [81] conducted a study on post-operative
    wound observation via remote access. The findings suggested that the patients
    were satisfied with this method of consultation and considered it to be feasible
    and safe for postoperative applications. B. Online Health Monitoring With the
    advent of 5G technologies, it is possible to realize the concept of virtual hospitals
    which provide a variety of services over a communication channel. Oleshchuk and
    Fensli [82] addressed security and privacy issues that need to be considered when
    implementing a health monitoring application in the 5G communication context.
    Limitations of the existing cellular technologies with respect to body area network
    were highlighted and possible solutions based on some new approaches in terms
    of 5G were also proposed. Biswas and Misra [83] discuss low cost, reliable e-Health
    monitoring device using an IoT-based platform architecture that can measure the
    vital signs of an individual, securely store the data on a server and analyze
    the data to generate specific proactive alerts when necessary. The platform connects
    the patient to the registered doctors who will have access to the patient’s health
    data which are monitored using medical sensors. Hence, the platform can be used
    to provide clinical healthcare at a distance, thus enabling the monitoring of
    elderly or home bound patients and those who are located in remote areas. Jusak
    et al. [77] propose an IoMT system for monitoring cardiac signals using an agent
    and manager model. The agent collects the signals in the form of a phonocardiograph
    signal which is then sent to the manager which gathers the health data and presents
    it to the healthcare providers via a web interface. This model can be extended
    to other types of monitoring application where the patient data can be accessed
    securely from any location in the world by a doctor or healthcare provider. C.
    Remote Diagnosis West [10] discusses the potential of using 5G networks to deploy
    remote healthcare systems that would allow for real-time monitoring and management
    of several sources of health data and efficiently diagnose an ailment event before
    it manifests. Brito [78] summarizes IoT and related e-health applications which
    include medical expertise using advanced tele-diagnostic tools, enabling remote
    physical examination (even by touch) through a robot that is remotely controlled,
    which can offer audio-visual and haptic feedback. The authors identify the requirements
    that enable such applications to be implemented, including enhanced mobile broadband,
    milli-meter wave communication and low latency high reliable communications. Chen
    et al. [84] propose a 5G-Smart Diabetes system, which combines state-of-the-art
    technologies such as wearable 2.0, ML and big data to generate comprehensive sensing
    and analysis for patients suffering from diabetes. They also present the data
    sharing mechanism and personalized data analysis model for 5G-Smart Diabetes.
    Bagula et al. [85] detail a cyber-physical healthcare system which allows for
    recognition of a patient’s condition that is considered at the first step in a
    fully digitized remote healthcare system. ML is used in the multi-layer framework
    that consists of numerous low cost lightweight devices. D. Mobile Robotic Surgery
    With the advancement of 5G technologies, the popularity of mobile robotic surgery
    is set to grow substantially [86]. Haptic sensing is an essential requirement
    for an efficient remote surgical procedure to be conducted. Lema et al. [87] tested
    a tele surgery system which implements a tactile glove to provide haptic feedback
    and observed how it could improve the performance of remote surgery applications.
    The performance of robotic tele-surgery depends on various properties of the communication
    network such as latency, jitter and packet loss; which is considered significant
    when the remote surgery system is implemented with haptic feedback. This highlights
    the significant challenges that need to be addressed in order to use a reliable
    and secure but cost-effective communication setup for remote/robotic surgery applications
    [88]. Surgical robots will provide an alternative to maintain the high quality
    of personal and medical care in Europe, where remotely operated devices would
    allow the healthcare system to operate at a much higher performance and cost-effectiveness.
    To reduce the performance degradation resulting from large latencies, the operator
    needs to be within the proximity of the remote site. Implementing 5G technologies
    would reduce the latency issues which would improve the access to mobile robotic
    surgery. SECTION VI. Open Research Challenges and Future Directions In this section,
    we shed light on some of the open research challenges in terms of V2X, drones
    and healthcare and highlight interesting research topics for future directions.
    A list of potential research challenges along with their future directions is
    listed below. Path loss and channel model of higher carrier frequencies is a challenging
    issue specially in areas surrounded by skyscraper buildings and having a denser
    base-station deployment. Latency of less than 1 millisecond in emergency situations
    for autonomous cars and automatic pilot is an important issue that needs to be
    ensured in the future cellular technologies. Ultra-reliable communication is another
    open issue that needs to be addressed in the future for both vehicle and public
    safety. A lot of work has already been done in this area, but still with the introduction
    of IoT and massive number of connected devices will make it a challenging issue
    again. Another important issue that needs to be researched is the identification
    of vulnerabilities and security loopholes in the new communication system. A tremendous
    amount of work is required at physical layer to identify the suitable techniques
    to cope with the compromised user equipment and data. Effective use of ML techniques
    to analyze and differentiate between normal and attacker behaviors is also a research
    challenge. Similarly, in terms of V2P, the response time and detection of vulnerable
    road users by a self-driving car is a challenging issue that needs to be explored.
    In terms of drones, The main problem with UAV/drone communication is the energy
    limitation. It becomes more critical in situations like disaster management and
    mission critical infrastructures. A lot of work has been done in battery technologies
    but still there are gaps that needs to be addressed in the future by using beamforming
    techniques. Latency and reliability are the two main factors that needs to be
    ensured in UAV operations such as search and rescue, fire monitoring etc. in order
    to help the rescue teams and safeguard the survivors. Continuous video streaming
    in disaster situation needs a reliable connection between UAV and ground stations.
    Assurance of a reliable link will require ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability
    that can be addressed in the next generation of cellular communication. Security
    and privacy problems such as eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing in aerial networks
    is another challenge in UAV communication. Lightweight techniques and AI solutions
    can be used to address these issues. Mobility support and collision avoidance
    in terms of Internet of UAVs are some of the other challenges that need to be
    researched in the future. Finally, in terms of healthcare, online consultation,
    robotic surgery and telemedicine requires a network that can support high-definition
    video streaming. In such cases ultra-low latency of less than 10ms and ultra-high
    reliable connection are required. Latency of less than 10ms is a critical challenge
    and an open research problem in future cellular communication. Reliable and real-time
    remote monitoring requires a high speed network and a reliable connection, otherwise
    practitioners will be unable to get the real-time data that can be used for quick
    and on-time healthcare decisions. Providing higher bandwidth and reliable connections
    are still an open problem that need to be addressed in future cellular networks.
    Integration of AI techniques for potential diagnosis (in the healthcare sector)
    that can lead to the best treatment plan is also a research area that needs to
    be explored. SECTION VII. Conclusions In this paper, we have explored 5G use-cases
    emphasizing on three main case studies: V2X communication, Drones, and Healthcare
    in order to identify the most challenging use-case for our future work. Starting
    with V2X communication, we explored V2V, V2P, V2I, and IV Communication along
    with their application areas. We also addressed the limitations and challenges
    of the existing communication technologies and proposed solutions based on 5G
    technologies. We further studied drone communication for mission critical infrastructures
    and provide a comparative analysis of 4G (LTE/LTE-A) and 5G with respect to control
    latency. Moreover, we examined healthcare with respect to 4G and 5G technologies
    and provide an overview of online consultation, online health monitoring, remote
    diagnosis, and mobile robotic surgery. Based on the literature review and critical
    analysis, we have concluded that drone communication for the provision and maintenance
    of critical infrastructures is the most challenging scenario that can be carried
    to the next phase of our work. In the future, we are planning to extend this work
    and propose to identify tools in which we can simulate our initial models in order
    to validate them and check their applicability for real-time applications. We
    also look forward to implementing the model in a real-time testbed. The potential
    impact on standard bodies along with community benefits is also part of our future
    plans. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Vehicle

    • Low cost and intelligent device for smart irrigation applications. • Neural
    network based intelligence is provided to the device for better assistance. •
    Remote monitoring enabled using MQTT and HTTP protocols. • Portable, light weight
    and user friendly. Abstract Agriculture contributes to a major share in the Indian
    economy and most of its people are dependent on it for their livelihood. This
    makes water an important resource that needs to be preserved using the latest
    available technologies. Apart from being fundamental in industry 4.0, IoT also
    extends its capability to smart farming. Work proposed here targets to develop
    a low cost intelligent system for smart irrigation. It uses IoT to make devices
    used in the system to talk and connect on their own, with capabilities like: admin
    mode for user interaction, one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation,
    neural based decision making for intelligent support and remote data monitoring.
    A sample crop test-bed has been chosen to present results of the proposed system,
    that include irrigation schedule, neural net decision making and remote data viewing.
    Neural network provides required intelligence to the device that considers current
    sensor input and masks the irrigation schedule for efficient irrigation. The system
    uses MQTT and HTTP to keep the user informed about the current crop situation
    even from a distant location. The proposed system proves beneficial with its intelligence,
    low cost and portability, making it suitable for greenhouse, farms, etc. Previous

    networkIrrigation 1. Introduction It is estimated that India’s population will
    surpass 1.69 billion by 2050 Coale and Hoover (2015), and the current food availability
    is itself not sufficient to feed the people. Till date, traditional farming that
    is used in fields could be one of the reasons behind reduced crop production even
    though ample arable land is available. It thus becomes essential to merge the
    developing technologies with agriculture and perform intelligent farming. Digital
    India concept has led to tremendous growth in digital information storage, retrieval
    and communication and, one such concept Internet of Things (IoT) Xia et al. (2012)
    targets making human life more comfortable. It can be referred to as a system
    of inter-related computing devices, objects, things, animals, people, etc. that
    have the capability to share information over a network without human involvement.
    The idea of IoT has been blooming since decades, but it got recognized in 1999
    Gama et al. (2012) only after it was mentioned by Kevin Ashton co-founder and
    executive director of the Auto-ID Center at MIT. His words in Ashton (2009) describe
    IoT as: “Today computers and, therefore, the Internet are almost wholly dependent
    on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte
    is 1024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created
    by human beings by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture
    or scanning a bar code”. This concept is the crux of smart technology and can
    be applied to gardens/farms for proper irrigation management. Smart farming is
    a well-established domain and there are numerous advantages of combining technology
    with farmers’ experience like: improved crop health Rumpf et al. (2010), better
    poultry farm animal health and tracking Floyd (2015), water management Gutierrez
    et al., 2014, Kaloxylos et al., 2013 food from farm to plate, etc. Numerous work
    has been done and is being carried out by various research groups in the smart
    agriculture domain, and details of a few works have been presented in this section.
    Water is one of the most important resources when it comes to farming. This has
    led to an extensive work related to efficient utilization of this limited resource.
    A large amount of water, approximately 100x more than personal use is consumed
    by food and agriculture and almost 70% of river and groundwater is utilized in
    irrigation making them the largest consumers of water resources Siebert et al.
    (2010). Currently, out of 3600 km3 of fresh water, nearly half is lost due to
    evaporation, transpiration FAO and Rome (2002) from the crops, etc. while the
    remaining half adds the groundwater level. Most of the water involved in agriculture
    is provided directly by rainfall, but the places with drought have only irrigation
    as an option for farming purpose. A typical irrigation system comprises of a layout:
    irrigation method, source: nearby water body, carriers: pipelines to the farm,
    actuators: on/off mechanism to control water, valves: water flow control. There
    are methods as mentioned by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO) Brouwer and Heibloem (1986) to compute irrigation requirements of crops.
    To achieve these needs of crops, there are various ways to irrigate them. These
    include drip, sprinkler, furrow, manual, etc. Out of these ways to irrigate, drip
    has the highest efficiency and a well designed one can even reach to 100% when
    it comes to water usage. Irrigation water management has to adapt to the increasing
    food requirements and “more crop per drop” Luquet et al. (2005) needs to be adopted.
    The main technologies to be used in the developing countries with abundant labor
    and scarce capital are drip and underground irrigation, which depend upon frequent
    small amounts of water directly to the root zone of the crops. Agriculture will
    always remain the most dominant user of water resources at the global level and
    is bound to boost particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Thus substantial
    contribution of irrigation in agriculture is needed in future that will save people
    from famine and nutritional deaths. Wireless sensor network (WSN) for irrigation
    management has proved out to be helpful for water savings. WSN as the name suggests,
    is a connected network of sensor nodes that nodes directly interact with the environment
    and provide real time information that is helpful in identifying farm areas in
    need. It can be used as both a data collection device and a decision making tool
    for real time monitoring. Gutierrez et al. (2014) presents a WSN for plant water
    usage optimization. The system is powered by photovoltaic panels for long working
    duration. Similar work using solar power has been proposed by Miranda et al. in
    Miranda et al. (2005), and, authors in Dursun and Ozden (2011) have also presented
    a WSN for controlled irrigation and monitoring. In Vellidis et al. (2008) a low
    cost system for irrigation scheduling in cotton using real-time wireless sensors
    is proposed. Similar works using WSN but targeted to mango orchard and apple orchard
    have been presented in Nooriman et al., 2018, Meng et al., 2018 respectively.
    A new place where WSN could be implemented is presented by authors in Lopez-Iturri
    et al. (2018) where a WSN combined with cloud for data storing and an app as an
    educational resource platform in school gardens, with the aim of enhancing technological
    skills in students. Greenhouse crop management using WSN has been presented by
    Jimenez et al. in Jiménez et al. (2012) and greenhouse control by Gonda et al.
    in Gonda and Cugnasca (2006). A WSN based potato monitoring and irrigation management
    using low power sensor nodes has been presented in Shinghal et al. (2017). This
    work estimates crop related and the environmental parameters using the nodes and
    model. The work is specific to potato whereas our work can be applied to variety
    of crops with single calibration by the user. Another work using WSN targets resource
    poor farmers for water control and is presented by Rashid et al. in Hussain et
    al. (2012). Dong et al. in Dong et al. (2013) target soil moisture monitoring
    using WSN and present an autonomous irrigation management system. Related works
    and surveys on WSN have been presented in Akyildiz et al., 2002, Baronti et al.,
    2007, Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011, Yick et al.,
    2008. A dedicated survey for WSN in agriculture drafted in Kalaivani et al. (2011)
    provides an overview of zibgee based network application to farming where it utilizes
    the WSN to monitor the ambient, soil, plant health conditions, etc. Using precision
    agriculture (PA), a technique where the soil works better, not harder, has been
    used by authors in Srbinovska et al. (2015) for greenhouse based vegetation using
    WSN. Similar work that combined PA and IoT for decision and control has been proposed
    in Patokar and Gohokar (2018), where the data is collected and transferred for
    decision making using IoT. This work uses sensor data with pre-defined threshold
    for decision making, whereas, work in our paper considers neural and ET based
    methods and selects one of two based on past and current conditions. Thus it handles
    abrupt situations and relates complex inputs to the water needs. Another work
    presented in Chaudhary et al. (2011) automatically monitors and controls the greenhouse
    parameters using PA. Machine learning provide systems with the potential to automatically
    learn, program and get better without external stimuli and programming. It focuses
    to develop programs that can self learn. Decision support system that uses machine
    learning has been presented in Dutta et al. (2014) and a study for decision systems
    and its use in water management has been presented by Guariso et al. in Guariso
    et al. (1985). Ramesh and Samraj (2018) targets fruit farms of Namakkal area in
    Tamil Nadu and presents a fuzzy based system for irrigation optimization. The
    authors use thermal imaging, air statistics as inputs, multifactor dimension method
    for removing sensor data redundancy and uses low power devices to improve battery
    life. Another work that uses fuzzy based decision support system for irrigation
    management in vineyard is proposed by authors in Viani et al. (2017). Current
    irrigation systems make use of direct parameter thresholds, fuzzy logic to get
    the water requirement. The parameters that are tracked mostly include the ambient
    temperature, humidity, soil water content and they do not form a simple relationship
    with the crop water needs. This requires to get into complexities and make use
    of neural network (NN) to decide for irrigation. NN is a subset of machine learning
    that mimic the human brain and can process information similar to it. Alike the
    human brain, NN comprises of various connected elements called neurons that work
    to solve problems. This is also addressed in this paper, and also one of the targeted
    users is the Indian farmer, an economically feasible equipment would be beneficial.
    Current solutions are crop specific and more generic systems are needed. To achieve
    this, a novice user-device interaction is introduced here. It thus suggests that
    it is essential for technology to contribute in farming sector as well by making
    best use of current advancements and implementing them in traditional methods.
    People should be more aware and, adopt techniques to reduce the burden and provide
    easy access even from distant place. Thus, considering the current research in
    India in smart farming domain, this paper presents a crop monitoring and automatic
    irrigation system that performs: • Interacts with user and gets planted crop details.
    • Estimates beforehand the irrigation schedule for complete season. • Gets ambient
    and soil statistics. • Performs evapotranspiration and neural based irrigation
    decision. • Alerts irrigation unit to enable zone-wise watering. • Sends sensor
    data to MQTT broker to allow remote data monitoring. The remaining paper is organized
    as: the proposed system and subject scenario are presented in Section 2. The results
    of various system modules have been shown in Section 3. Finally the paper is concluded
    in Section 4 and references have been mentioned at the end. 2. Proposed system
    This work proposes a greenhouse/garden/farm monitoring and automatic irrigation
    system capable of tracking down the crop water needs, alerting the irrigation
    unit and user regarding it, providing real-time and history of farm data. It also
    achieves effective utilization of water with the help of an automatic irrigation
    system for plants by taking into consideration the plant and soil needs. Table
    1 provides the nomenclature used in this work. Water needs depend upon various
    factors and in this work, for , it has been defined by Eq. (1), where the function
    is modeled using neural network (NN). Allen et al. (1998) can be computed using
    Eq. 2 where, is defined as the property of plants used in predicting ; a combination
    of evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from the plant leaves, stems,
    flowers, etc. These parameters altogether define the water requirement of a crop
    which is achieved using this work without any human intervention. There are radiation,
    temperature, pan co-efficient based methods such as Penman-Monteith Bogawski and
    Bednorz (2014), Hargreaves, Blaney-Criddle, Linacre, Priestly-Taylor, Trajkovic,
    etc. mentioned in Pandey et al. (2016) for estimating , and this work makes use
    of the Blaney-Criddle method. (1) (2) Table 1. Nomenclature used in the work.

    time duration in which the user needs to input data for the crop that is to be
    planted and for which IN schedule is desired, and soil type. After admin time-out,
    a one time setup is done which loads the crop related data taken from user, which
    is then used to compute the evapotranspirations and the irrigation needs. In the

    Pole (USP) USP is the brain of the proposed system specially designed for intelligent
    decision making. Fig. 4 shows its prototype installation which costs 850 ( $13),
    that comprises of (a) crop, (b–c) sensors, (d) controller, that consists of ESP8266
    which does all the tasks. Algorithm 1 gives pseudocode for this module. For a
    realistic scenario where multiple plants need be grown, the targets are defined
    in the algorithm. The crop details fetched from the user are taken as the input
    to estimate the water requirement. The planting area is divided into zones based
    on type of plants and the area coverage where multiple USPs are placed. The area
    that receives average water is chosen to insert the sensor, as it can precisely
    sense requirement of nearby areas. Selecting area that receives less water could
    lead to overlogging whereas, area that gets more water might create water stress
    to the crop. Download : Download high-res image (702KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Module prototype installation (a) plant, (b) soil moisture sensor,
    (c) temperature and humidity sensor, (d) controller (USP). USP gives the environmental
    and soil water status using sensors that provide with { } and { } at intervals,
    and it uses them for computing the irrigation requirement. It controls the sensors
    and is responsible for the decision making and sending request to IU. The USP
    prototype is inserted at locations to get the real time physical data and analyze
    it. Initially, USP works in admin mode until time-out, where the user is required
    to provide data which gets saved on it for remaining all computations. It loads:
    and then computes . Using Allen et al. (1998), is computed which is used as reference
    for crop water requirement. Apart from this computation, the irrigation schedule
    is estimated which provides in advance the dates when irrigation needs to take
    place for the planted crop. These irrigation dates are saved in a file on USP.
    This file with the estimated schedule is then sent once to the server using FTP
    via internet. After one time setup is complete, data is fetched from sensors at
    intervals and the USP goes for decision making using the sensor data, for which
    a data window is set that is used to select mode from either : mode with previously
    estimated or : mode with computation. Mode selection is required in case random
    weather changes occur frequently so that switching could be done between the two
    available modes using the decision (mode) block. The normal mode initiates IN,
    based on the computed values in setup mode, whereas is selected when adverse conditions
    occur. Switching to needs a NN to predict and compute {0,1}. A 2-layer NN shown
    in Fig. 5(a) is trained using “nftool” of MATLAB and its functionality using weights
    and biases post training along with the inputs is implemented in decision (water)
    block of USP (seen in Fig. 3) to get the final decision (n = 4). This decision
    alongwith module id is sent to the IU which actuates for the required zone . Fig.
    5(b) shows the inputs, target output and the trained output to it. Here, output,
    physical data, crop stage and saved outputs from crop database are initially used
    for training purpose, whereas, the real-time data uses the trained network to
    generate required output. In the next step, USP connects to the MQTT broker running
    on the SIU via internet where it publishes the sensor data for further analysis
    and real-time remote monitoring. USP-MQTT communication can be seen from Fig.
    6, where USP initiates a connection with the broker and publishes data to topics.
    This data could be viewed remotely by subscribing to specific topics. The broker
    is created using an open source platform Mosquitto Light (2013) that implements
    the MQTT protocol. MQTT is chosen over HTTP due to its benefits like, lightweight
    and minimal message size thus less bandwidth requirement and high speed Velez

    unit based on the data received from USP through WiFi (client-server scenario).
    Algorithm 2 shows the working of IU that serves as an accesspoint where multiple
    USPs send their irrigation requests which consists of a (a) ESP8266 based controller
    which is programmed to accept, attend requests and send signal to, (b) relay that
    turns on/off the (c) motor as shown in Fig. 7(a). Initially during setup, ports
    are defined for different zones and are set as outputs to enable/disable irrigation.
    Also the IU is configured by providing it with a unique IP so that the USP clients
    can connect to it and send their requests. Doing this enables the unit to accept
    irrigation requests from USPs and water required zones. It then checks for available
    clients and if any request is received it parses the data to get the ON time duration
    and unique id so that correct zone can be irrigated. It writes data to the corresponding
    port and again gets back to scan for more requests and again turns the relay ON
    and/or OFF for respective zones. The IU is capable to serve multiple requests
    simultaneously, so it attends USP in every zone thus eliminating the need of any
    queue and waiting time. Download : Download high-res image (170KB) Download :

    multiple clients. Fig. 7(b) shows the IU accepting two clients simultaneously
    and sending alert to the relay for motor control. It recognizes the client by
    its id and send the received motor input to the motor control module i.e. the
    relay and then gets back to wait for more requests. This functionality benefits
    when multiple and varied plants are cultivated in a single place where IU can
    answer to every zones’ requests. It further sends status feedback to USP thus
    achieving a continuous monitoring process. Items used in the farm i.e. motor pump,
    drip set and IU cost 12 ($800). Algorithm 2 Irrigation Unit  1: Require:  2: for

    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), a lightweight messaging protocol for power efficient
    devices and sensors based on a publish-subscribe mechanism is 74x faster and lighter
    than HTTP. There are three options when it comes to hosting an MQTT server, (i)
    locally installed server, (ii) cloud based/virtual server and (iii) shared server
    application. Mosquitto, HiveMQ, cloudmqtt, mosca, RabbitMQ, flespi are some MQTT
    brokers. It works on a publish-subscribe mechanism, where the sensors/device publish
    data to topics on the MQTT broker. End user, called as subscribers in this case
    can view the sensor data by subscribing to the respective topics. Here, the publishers
    and the subscribers are unaware of each other and they do not communicate directly
    with each other, instead they are connected to the broker. It is the topics on
    the broker to which data is published and is subscribed to. A generic publish-subscribe
    scenario taking place in MQTT communication is shown in Fig. 6. In this work,
    open source MQTT broker Mosquitto is used (created on SIU), to which the USP modules
    publish sensor data under specific topics, for instance/usp/ id / param and, the
    users subscribe to the same topic for viewing the data. As shown in Fig. 8, a
    python script runs continuously at the back-end of the broker, that takes the
    incoming data on the MQTT port, segregates and saves the zone-wise data. As seen
    from Eq. 3 the rate of change of the sensor values is very small ( ∊ is infinitesimally
    small value) and also the data sampling rate is 5 min, here, the Quality of Service
    (QoS) 0 is set at the broker. This data and the estimated IN schedule file are
    used by the HTTP server (running on the SIU) for display on user webpage. The
    Mosquitto broker, HTTP, FTP server and python script all run on the SIU. Any PC
    including a Raspberry Pi can be used as to obtain this functionality (minimum
    cost $39). Section 3 shows results for the system and its modules. (3) ∊ Download

    test bed of spinach seeds and continuous monitoring for the growing period. The
    results for every step of the system have been taken and mentioned in this section.
    3.1. Admin mode Each plant has different requirements based on its family kingdom
    so the IN needs differ. To make it suitable for all crops, admin mode is created
    where the user enters these details: { , soil type} used for growing it. Each
    USP is assigned a unique id using which it creates an access point and the user
    connects to it. The user then enters the data that is saved onto the device for
    further computations by the one-time setup module. Fig. 9 shows results obtained
    for the admin mode for test USP. The admin homepage Fig. 9(a) shows three tabs
    for network configuration-information and, for USP configuration in Fig. 9(b)–(d).
    Figs. 9(e) and (f) show the options for crop information selection wherein, the
    required crop, date and soil type are selected. These user selected values are
    saved and used during the one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation. Download

    Admin mode. 3.2. One-time setup After admin mode time-out, USP enters a one-time
    setup in which the following parameters are obtained: • . • Stagewise and monthwise
    . • and . • M: . if else . • . The values computed in this mode for some sample
    crops are mentioned in Table 2. The crop IN needs are computed based on the date
    and soil of plantation and, accordingly the irrigation schedule is also computed
    which suggests best suitable dates for irrigating the crops. This data is stored
    onto the device until next changes are made by the user in admin mode and is used
    as reference for irrigation. The stagewise values, dates and other data for spinach
    is shown in Fig. 10. is also computed during the setup mode and is sent to the
    IU for irrigation purpose. It can be computed using Eq. 4, where the water flow
    depends upon the gross net irrigation depth (crop specific), irrigation interval
    between two consecutive schedules and and, net application rate is with respect
    to the motor chosen. (4) Table 2. IN schedule for sample crops. Crop Date of plantation

    image Fig. 10. Computed parameters for spinach. 3.3. Neural network training Though
    the soil water availability can be controlled my means of irrigation, the ambient
    conditions are still uncontrollable, thus creating a complex relationship between
    them. This implies that the decision taken on the basis of these values do not
    completely reflect the needed one. To relate the required output with the sensor
    inputs, simple equations are not enough and so here NN is employed for getting
    precisely accurate output. A crop IN requirement database is used to train the
    NN shown in Fig. 5 where, and : input layer nodes, : the hidden layer nodes and
    : the drip output computed by the network. Bayesian regularization algorithm is
    used in training done by the network. Weights and biases obtained post-training
    are used to compute the output and outcome on selection of mode. The network training
    results can be seen from Fig. 11, where, the training and performance could be
    seen. Fig. 11(a) shows the performance during training, validation and testing
    of sensor dataset. It is measured in terms of the mean square error value (MSE),
    which is the mean squared difference between the target and obtained output. For
    validation, the best performance is observed at epoch 85 and its value is 0.0037699
    represented by encircled point in the figure. The x-axis in Figs. 11(a) and (b)
    mention 91 epochs which implies that the training stops after this point and the
    best performance is given from these epochs. Fig. 11(b) presents the training
    state values with respect to the number of training epoch. Here, gradient, Mu
    and validation failures are plotted and the plot titles represent the values obtained
    at the final epoch. Gradient is used to optimize the weights and biases by reducing
    the error using steepest descent method. Mu is the momentum update which is the
    training gain and the control parameter used by the algorithm to train the network.
    Its value affects the convergence and MATLAB considers 0.001 as default initial
    value. Training should be stopped if maximum Mu is reached as additional training
    would degrade learning. It is also seen that training results are obtained till
    91 epochs, it is because the training stops if the validation error fails to reduce
    for 6 iterations, and, it can be seen from the validation fail plot of Fig. 11(b).
    Further the error histogram for training, validation and testing is presented
    in Fig. 11(c) which shows that acceptable amount of error is achieved post training.
    Regression R measures correlation between outputs and targets. Its ideal value
    1 means the output portrays close relationship with target, while 0 is a random
    relationship. Regression values for this network training, validation and testing
    can be seen from Fig. 11(d). Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download

    monitoring Sensor data fetched using USP is: (i) sent to MQTT broker, (ii) used
    for mode M selection which then (iii) computes (iv) send request to IU, thus completing
    a continuous monitoring loop. The MQTT results for PC brokers are shown in Fig.
    12 where, Figs. 12(a)–(b) show Mosquitto broker results and (c) shows result for
    MQTT.fx, a MQTT dashboard for PC. Fig. 13 provides with dashboard view for an
    Android app running on Android Pie. The sensor data can be remotely seen by initiating
    a connection to the MQTT broker. Subscription to proper topic by the user gives
    data as seen in Fig. 13 where the temperature, humidity and soil moisture values
    can be noticed. Results shown are for “IoT MQTT dashboard” app available on Google
    play store for android users. It is available for download on “https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thn.iotmqttdashboard&hl=en”
    link TH (2016). The HTTP server running on the same machine allows users to login
    to their farms/gardens and, monitor the plant ambient situation, its moisture
    level, irrigation status and the irrigation schedule as well. Fig. 14 shows the
    user login page using which the user can view the day-wise data statistics of
    various crops he has planted. User can get day-wise data statistics for the whole
    growing period by entering the date and month as seen in Fig. 14. The plant-wise
    estimated IN schedule is also available on the plant homepage as seen from Fig.
    14(d). Fig. 15 shows the temperature, humidity and soil moisture data for selected
    date . Similar values can be seen for any date that falls in the plant growing
    period. Download : Download high-res image (652KB) Download : Download full-size

    current consumed by USP and Fig. 16 shows the consumption in mA. In the figure,
    the x-axis shows instances of samples where the current consumption is computed.
    The sampling rate used by the kit is 23, and values for 6000 samples have been
    shown in the figure. The current drawn by USP in different modes is mentioned
    on y-axis. When the device is started, it initially draws more current which thereafter
    reduces as it enters the admin mode. There is a further reduction and it is when
    the USP computes and the irrigation schedule. The current again increases as it
    enters the continuous monitoring mode as seen from the figure. Download : Download

    work can be seen from Fig. 17, where Fig. 17(a) shows the placement of USP and
    the growth can be seen in Fig. 17(b). Here, the USP needs to be configured first
    by the user as per the procedure given in Section 3.1. The IU setup then needs
    to be installed near the water source and pipes as per the required arrangement.
    After this has been done, the USP is to be inserted (selection of appropriate
    location has been mentioned in Section 2.1) and then USP and IU should be started.
    At the server end, script at the back end will fetch the incoming data and will
    direct it to the logfiles. Using this setup user can create his own automatic
    irrigation for his crops. Comparison of proposed system has been done with respect
    to percentage water savings over drip and traditional irrigation methods. A total
    of 12 drip emitters are used in the test bed made for the automatic irrigation
    system. Controlled water flow through the emitters is enforced for optimal usage,
    which provides 12.5% water savings with respect to normal drip method. Some estimated
    irrigation schedules were by-passed by NN due to proper conditions for the plant.
    A non-scheduled irrigation was performed by NN due to stress in soil. Thus NN
    has here ensured 20% of water savings from normal schedule. Finally overall water
    savings of 30% and 67% has been achieved using the system with respect to normal
    drip and traditional irrigation methods respectively. Download : Download high-res

    4. Conclusion This paper presents a farm monitoring and automatic irrigation system
    that has three modules: (i) unified sensor pole (USP), low cost and intelligent
    IoT based module, (ii) irrigation unit (IU), and (iii) sensor information unit
    (SIU). For user access, USP initially remains for some time in admin mode where
    it gets crop, plantation date and soil data, which it uses in one-time setup mode
    for evapotranspiration and irrigation schedule computation. Finally, it goes into
    a continuous monitoring mode where it senses the data, uses it for NN based decision
    making, sends the decision to IU and sensor data to SIU. The IU is responsible
    for parsing and writing incoming data from USP to correct port and turning ON/OFF
    water for the required zone. It keeps on checking for incoming clients and performs
    accordingly. SIU stores the sensor data by directing the incoming data stream
    on Mosquitto broker to log files, which is used by the HTTP server running on
    the same machine to allow remote sensor data monitoring. Detailed results for
    all the modules have been presented in the paper for a sample testbed. The cost
    of USP (brain of the system) is around $800–$1000 ( 12– 15). Overall water savings
    of 67% over traditional way is achieved using the system. Thus effective water
    utilization and visit-free monitoring provides smart solution in water scare areas
    and people far away from their farms. The necessity of preserving this natural
    resource justifies the usage of such automatic systems. Its easy access, cost
    effectivity and usability make it versatile and thus suitable for varied population
    and, potential like, adaptivity and portability make it fit for use in house vegetation,
    greenhouse, etc. Acknowledgements The work presented in this paper has been supported

    \ Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops\
    \ to highly sophisticated controlled \nenvironment agriculture (CEA) facilities\
    \ that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture.  The advances\
    \ and \nimprovements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient\
    \ production of plants in populated cities and \nmulti-story buildings.  Successful\
    \ deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems,\
    \ as \nwell as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should\
    \ be systematically considered and integrated.  This \nreview is an attempt to\
    \ highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA\
    \ in order to raise the \nawareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which\
    \ is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture.  This \nstudy\
    \ reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in\
    \ the frame and covering materials, \nenvironment perception and data sharing,\
    \ and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models.  This research\
    \ \nhighlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming,\
    \ rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are \nthe extensions of CEA and\
    \ have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation,\
    \ and urbanization \nthat are threatening food security.  Finally, several opportunities\
    \ and challenges have been identified in implementing the \nintegrated CEA and\
    \ vertical farming for urban agriculture. \nKeywords: smart agriculture, greenhouse\

    \ \ntransition driven by the advances in precision technology, data \nprocessing\
    \ and smart farming.  Protected cultivations have \nchanged from simple covered\
    \ greenhouse structures to high-tech \nplant factories that optimize the productivity\
    \ of the plants and \nhuman labour.  A modern greenhouse operates as a system,\
    \ \ntherefore, it is also referred to as controlled environment agriculture \n\
    (CEA), controlled environment plant production system (CEPPS), \nor Phytomation\
    \ systems[1].  These structures use natural or \nartificial light within which\
    \ optimum growth conditions is intended \nto achieve for producing horticultural\
    \ crops, or for plant research \nprograms.  They also offer greater predictability,\
    \ reduce the cost \nof production and increase crop yields.  A comprehensive history\
    \ \nof greenhouses in the past three decades can be found in the works \nof [2-6].\
    \  Examples of earlier works in automation and computer \ncontrol of greenhouse\
    \ environment are showed in [7-9].  Previous \nstudies on greenhouse engineering\
    \ during the 1990s have been \nreviewed by Hanan[10] and Critten and Bailey[11].\
    \ \nThe United Nations has predicted that by 2050, more than \ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ nine billion world population will live in the cities.  \nSecuring the supply\
    \ chain of fresh fruits and vegetables in this new \nscenario will be an overwhelming\
    \ challenge.  If properly designed, \n2   January, 2018                      \

    \                Vol. 11 No.1 \nmanaged, and operated, CEA by means of agri-cubes\
    \ and plant \nfactories can significantly contribute to this context for the \n\
    year-round production of fresh vegetables in urban areas.  For \nsuch a system\
    \ to operate successfully and achieve its production \nobjectives, attention needs\
    \ to be paid to the technical aspects of \nautomation (A), culture (C), environment\
    \ (E) and system (SYS).  \nTing et al.[1] defined ACESYS terms as follow: Automation\
    \ is the \nprocessing of information and execution of tasks for operation of \n\
    CEA through computerized instrumentations and various control \nalgorithms that\
    \ might include decision support programs and \nartificial intelligence.  The\
    \ cultural and environmental factors \ncomprise \ncultivation \ntechniques, \n\
    plants \ncharacteristics, \nmicroclimate requirements and growth responses.  It\
    \ also contains \nmorphological and physiological conditions such as “multiplication,\
    \ \nrooting, transplanting, pruning, water and nutrient delivery, \npesticide\
    \ application, harvesting, post-harvest processing, etc”.  \nTing et al.[1] stated\
    \ that “Systems analysis and integration is a \nmethodology that starts with the\
    \ definition of a system and its goals, \nand leads to the conclusion regarding\
    \ the system’s workability, \nproductivity, reliability, and other performance\
    \ indicators.” \nResearch trends in this field are toward innovative methods for\
    \ \nshifting from conventional greenhouses to smart controlled \nenvironments\
    \ that benefit from natural resources for eliminating \ndeleterious external conditions.\
    \  The ultimate objective in this \nregard would be achieving high yield and high-quality\
    \ fruits at \nminimum possible cost. \nInnovations in the low-cost and low-power\
    \ consumption \nsensors and instrumentations, communication devices, data \nprocessing\
    \ and mobile applications, along with the technological \nadvances in the design\
    \ structures, simulation models, and \nhorticultural engineering have provided\
    \ the state-of-the-art \nfacilities that are shifting the traditional CEA to plant\
    \ factories for \nurban farming.  This paper begins with a summary of several\
    \ \nreviewed literature in Section 2 on the advances in greenhouse \ncovering\
    \ materials, artificial light, and the efficiency of the \nmicroclimate controller\
    \ for a viable CEA system.  This part aimed \nto investigate the effects of the\
    \ existing and new covering materials \non the resulting microclimate (including\
    \ influencing factors and \ntheir interactions with cultural practices), plants\
    \ growth, and yield.  \nModeling of CEA, as well as object-oriented automation-culture-\
    \ \nenvironment system analysis that is presented in the works of Ting \net al.[1]\
    \ provide a systematic approach for a better understanding of \nthese influencing\
    \ factors.  These findings and their implications in \na modern CAE such as plant\
    \ factories and agri-cubes are further \ndiscussed in Section 5.  After that,\
    \ environmental monitoring and \nperception by means of wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSN) and \ninternet of things-based (IoT-based) platforms have been \ndemonstrated\
    \ and reviewed as an essential part of an automation \nsystem.  In our opinion,\
    \ the three biggest challenges for the \ndevelopment of an efficient and viable\
    \ CEA system are the creation \nof automation levels for energy management, reduction\
    \ of \nenvironmental impact, and maximizing use of natural resources.  \nA comprehensive\
    \ review of the advances in environmental control \nmethods, energy optimization\
    \ models, prediction tools, and \ndecision support systems are provided in Section\
    \ 4.  Specifically, \nthe applications of different high-level algorithms for\
    \ the most \nefficient microclimate control solutions are highlighted in Section\
    \ \n4.1.  These control methods and automation phases have been \nreviewed to\
    \ illustrate how each part can facilitate achieving the \noverall objectives of\
    \ a CEA.  A summary of some of the research \nworks in the past decade on energy\
    \ analysis, artificial intelligence, \nand simulation models with applications\
    \ in different aspects of \ngreenhouse production are presented in Sections 4.2\
    \ and 4.3.  A \nsubstantial amount of research has been done on individual aspects\
    \ \nof automation, culture, and environment, as well as their \ncombination, however\
    \ improvements of CEA also require decision \nsupport systems (DSS) and assessment\
    \ tools for long-term risk \nmanagement by accurately determining the interactions\
    \ between \nclimate parameters and growth responses prior to the actual \ncultivation[12].\
    \  To identify technological pathways for energy \nefficient CEA, a survey was\
    \ performed in Section 4.4 to highlight \nsome of the improved solutions based\
    \ on decision support systems \nfor energy management strategies in the commercial\
    \ greenhouses.  \nIn Section 5, the research covered urban agriculture and the\
    \ \ndevelopment of plant factories and vertical farming which is \ngrowing rapidly\
    \ in the East and Southeast Asia, most noticeably in \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan\
    \ Province of China, and Malaysia, and \nreviewed several conceptual designs such\
    \ as the rooftop \ngreenhouses to highlight how various research and educational\
    \ \ninstitutes, real estate developers, and construction companies are \ninvolved\
    \ in the emerged opportunities.   \n2  Considerations for viability \nSeveral\
    \ factors to be considered in designing of a viable \ngreenhouse system for producing\
    \ year-round crops and \nvegetables are the structure frame, landscape, topography,\
    \ soil, \nclimate conditions, microclimate control system, light condition, \n\
    intercepted solar radiation, windbreaks, the availability of \nelectricity, roadways,\
    \ and labor force.  Other conditions that \nshould also be taken into account\
    \ for an efficient large-scale \ncommercial greenhouse production[13,14] are the\
    \ environment, \neconomic and social factors.  For example, a modern greenhouse\
    \ \nstructure might be constructed within a commercial building or \nnear commercial\
    \ or residential lands.  Some of the most popular \ngreenhouse structures and\
    \ CEA are presented in Figure 1. There \nare numerous experimental and analytical\
    \ research works that \naddress how environmental parameters inside a greenhouse\
    \ is \naffected by the structural design and shape, volume size, \ndimensions,\
    \ plants density, covering films, structure material, \nwind speed, geographical\
    \ orientation, and most importantly the \nmicroclimate control system.  For example,\
    \ in regions where \nsolar radiation or ambient air temperatures are high, several\
    \ \ndesign factors for optimum air exchange such as the ratio of the \narea of\
    \ the vent openings to the ground area covered by the \ngreenhouse, the ratio\
    \ of the greenhouse volume to the floor area, \nand the vertical distance between\
    \ the air inlets and air outlets can \nsignificantly improve the ventilation performance.\
    \  Optimization \nof vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy\
    \ \nventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation has been studied \nby Kacira\
    \ et al.[15].  This section provides a summary of the \nresearch works that have\
    \ addressed improvements in covering \nmaterials, and microclimate control systems.\
    \  To avoid \noverlapping of the contexts and maintain a consistent flow of the\
    \ \ntopics, we have covered the advances in structure design (i.e., \nrooftop\
    \ greenhouses) as a separate subsection under urban \nagriculture. \nJanuary,\

    \ \n \n2.1  Covering materials \nConsiderations for greenhouses covering materials\
    \ involve \nsupporting foundation, shape and framing materials, geographical \n\
    direction for optimal light entrance, the load of equipment, factors \nfor static\
    \ and dynamic loads (i.e., hanging plants, structure weight, \nand wind speed),\
    \ dimension ratio, and volume.  Greenhouses \nstructures and covering can take\
    \ different forms which can be used \nto surround the whole or a section of the\
    \ cultivation area and space.  \nThe most dominant transparent materials in use\
    \ are 2-3 mm glass \npanels, net-screen film, and  0.1 mm and 0.2 mm Polyethylene\
    \ \n(PE) plastic films, and ultraviolet (UV) stabilized PE-films.  \nBaudoin et\
    \ al.[16] recommended that in order to obtain a reasonable \nheat rise of less\
    \ than 4°C in a glass-clad greenhouse, the airflow \nrate should be 0.04-0.05\
    \ m3/s of floor area (1 m2).  Selection of \ncovering material for a greenhouse\
    \ depends on its application, the \ntype of crop to be cultivated, and the climate\
    \ condition of the \nregion.  It can vary from simple covers such as one layer\
    \ plastic[17,18], \ndouble-wall plastic[19,20], and glass[21,22], to fiberglass[23,24],\
    \ \ndouble-wall plastic, acrylic sheet[25], polyethylene film[26-29], \npolyvinyl\
    \ \nchloride \n(PVC)[30], \ncopolymers[31], \nPolycarbonate \npanels[32], and\
    \ selective transmission medium[33,34] for different \nspectral frequencies. \
    \ Some of these materials are designed to trap \nenergy inside the greenhouse\
    \ and heats both plants zone and its \nsurroundings.  Detailed properties of these\
    \ covering, as well as the \nquality assessments of their mechanical properties,\
    \ have been \naddressed in detail by a study on the effects of cover diffusive\
    \ \nproperties on the components of greenhouse solar radiation[34]. \nCondensation,\
    \ radiation transmittance and diffusing properties \nof different types of transmitting\
    \ covering materials in greenhouses \nhave been discussed by Pollet et al.[35].\
    \  Glazing materials allow \nshorter-wavelength radiation (i.e. visible light)\
    \ to pass through, but \nlong wavelength radiation such as infrared (heat) is\
    \ trapped inside \nthe greenhouse.  A comparison between different greenhouse\
    \ \ncovering materials, including polyethylene film, photo-selective red \ncolor\
    \ film, and insect-proof net for tomato cultivation during \nsummer is available\
    \ in the works of Arcidiacono et al.[36] and \nHemming et al.[37] Jarquín-Enríquez\
    \ et al.[38] studied the effects of \ndouble layer plastic and flat glass cover\
    \ on the lycopene \naccumulation and color index during tomato fruit ripening.\
    \  They \nconcluded that lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits was increased\
    \ \nby the amount of light after the beginning of ripening growth stage.  \nStudying\
    \ the effect of greenhouse covering materials on the inside \nair temperature\
    \ under tropical climate condition showed that while \noutside temperature was\
    \ between 28°C-33°C, the temperature \ninside \na \npolyethylene \nfilm \ncovered\
    \ \ngreenhouse \nwithout \nenvironment control reached 68°C-70°C, leading to air\
    \ vapor \npressure deficit (VPD) of 4 kPa[39].  Al-Mahdouri et al.[40] \nevaluated\
    \ optical properties and thermal performances of different \ngreenhouse covering\
    \ materials.  The combinations of external \nclimate conditions and type of greenhouse\
    \ for the most appropriate \napplication have been studied by Kempkes et al.[41]\
    \ A computer \napplication to measure geometric characterization and dimensions\
    \ \nof insect-proof screens was designed by Álvarez et al.[42].  \nPolythene-clad\
    \ greenhouses do not become as hot because of the \ntransparency of the plastic\
    \ to long-wave radiation that is \ntransmitted back out of the greenhouse.  Therefore,\
    \ for a \npolythene-film covered greenhouse, the ventilation rate can be \nreduced\
    \ to 0.03-0.04 m3/s of floor area (1 m2)[43].  With \ngreenhouse shading, the\
    \ amount of solar radiation and light \nintensity reaching the plants is restricted,\
    \ creating a closed \ndifference between air temperature inside and outside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse.  Shading also decreases leaf surface temperature \nsignificantly.\
    \  According to Glenn et al.[44], while a 20% to 80% \nlight reduction can be\
    \ expected depending on the shading materials, \nthe sufficient light reduction\
    \ for most greenhouse applications is \nbetween 30% and 50%.  Hassanien and Li[45]\
    \ investigated the \nmicroclimate parameters and growth responses of lettuce plants\
    \ \ninside a greenhouse that was shaded with semi-transparent \nmono-crystalline\
    \ silicon double glazing photovoltaic panels \n(STPV).  The STPV panels of their\
    \ study accounted for 20% of \nthe greenhouse roof area, and showed that the combination\
    \ of \nSTPV and polyethylene cover decreased the solar radiation by 35% \nto 40%\
    \ compared to the use of polyethylene cover.  They also \nshowed that the STPV\
    \ shading decreased the air temperature by \n4   January, 2018               \

    \ effect on the relative \nhumidity, fresh weight, leaf area and the chlorophyll\
    \ contents under \nnatural ventilation. \nProtected cultivation of Solanaceous\
    \ crops such as tomatoes \nand peppers by means of Screen-houses operating on\
    \ natural \nventilation is now a commonly practiced in tropical lowlands for \n\
    reducing insect migration, the risk of damage by high rainfall, \nextreme solar\
    \ radiation, and high wind speeds.  In addition, by \nusing insect-proof net covered\
    \ greenhouse, the inside and outside \ntemperature may remain similar, while temperature\
    \ has been \nobserved to be rising with the photo-selective film during summer.\
    \  \nStudies showed that net-screen greenhouses have gained more \npopularity\
    \ in tropical regions due to the potential of climate \nparameters that have optimality\
    \ degrees close to the plants desired \nlevels.  Shamshiri[46] observed that under\
    \ an insect-proof \nnet-screen covered greenhouse operating on natural ventilation,\
    \ the \ninside and outside air temperature remained close to each other, \nwhile\
    \ the air temperature was found to increase inside two \nphoto-selective film\
    \ covered greenhouses (polycarbonate panel and \na polyethylene covered) operating\
    \ on evaporative cooling[39].  \nShading nets ease the natural ventilation process\
    \ and can protect \nplants from excessive sunlight, wind, and heavy rains.  Lorenzo\
    \ et \nal.[47] reported that movable shade under intense sunlight in Spain \n\
    caused 10% increase in the marketable yield of greenhouse tomato.  \nOther reports\
    \ indicated that external and internal shading nets \nreduced horizontal and vertical\
    \ gradients in air temperature \ncompared with those without shading nets[48].\
    \  Results of a study \non the effect of roof height of a large screen-house on\
    \ the \nventilation rate using one-dimensional computational model and \npreliminary\
    \ measurements showed that increasing roof height by 2 \nm increases both temperature\
    \ and humidity levels in the canopy \nlayer[49].  Microclimate, air velocity,\
    \ ventilation efficiency, and \nlight transmittance are mainly influenced by the\
    \ properties of the \nnet-screen mesh and the greenhouse shape.  While these structures\
    \ \nenhance natural ventilation in hot and humid climate conditions, \nthey still\
    \ require strong shelters for protecting plants from extreme \nsolar radiation,\
    \ rain, and strong winds.  The screen-house itself is \nan important pest protection\
    \ device, provided it is equipped with \nfine mesh screens in all openings, and\
    \ a double-door system. \n2.2  Light control and artificial lights \nThe main\
    \ approaches for controlling light level and the \nintercepted radiance in CEA\
    \ are through planted density, shading \nscreens, and artificial lights.  Light\
    \ condition and air temperature \nare the two most important environmental factors\
    \ for plants growth.  \nIn fact, discussions about optimal air temperature without\
    \ including \nlight condition and plant evapotranspiration does not generate any\
    \ \nuseful data for maximizing yield and producing high-quality \nvegetable. \
    \ Light and air temperature are intrinsically related and \nit is a well-known\
    \ fact that one cannot be optimized without \nconsidering the other.  For example,\
    \ tomato quality, including \nyield, productivity and lycopene value is not only\
    \ affected by the \nmicroclimate parameters and cultural experience, but with\
    \ the \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).  In fact, it is the \noptimal\
    \ combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and light \nthat will result\
    \ in maximum yield (assuming that other factors such \nas CO2, soil pH, and nutrient\
    \ are not limiting).  A schematic \ndiagram is presented in Figure 2 to illustrate\
    \ the effects of light \nspectral, intensity and photoperiod on plant growth,\
    \ along with a \ncomparison between spectral power distribution of natural and\
    \ \nartificial light sources, and the plant’s response to irradiance level. \n\

    modern greenhouses and CEAs are incandescent/halogen lamps, \ndischarge lamps\
    \ (such as fluorescent light tubes, Metal Halide, \nand high-pressure sodium lamps),\
    \ and the Light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs).  Among these, LEDs have gained significant\
    \ popularity \nin the research and development communities due to their \nadvantages\
    \ such as cost efficiency, compact design, durability, \nlight quality, and low\
    \ thermal energy generation.  Research on \nLEDs as a substitute for plant growth\
    \ began in 1980s; however it \nwas only after mid-2000s that they became economically\
    \ feasible \nfor large scale commercial production.  These devices reduce \nthe\
    \ costs of electricity by using plant from effectual \nJanuary, 2018         \

    \ carotene level \nof lycopene.  According to the study of Cockshull et al.[50],\
    \ plant \nfactory yield will be reduced by 20% by utilizing a cover with \n23%\
    \ shade.  Yields also will be enriched with color shaded in \nplant factories\
    \ in hot weathers.  Yet, color shades can be \ndisadvantageous in areas with limited\
    \ sunlight hours in cloudy \nand cold climates.  In fact, choosing suitable planting\
    \ density \ncan increase crop water output and improve light capture.  On \nthe\
    \ other hand, the planting density has an effect on the harvest of \ntomato in\
    \ greenhouse growing system and evapotranspiration \n(ET)[51].  According to the\
    \ reports of several studies, factors \nsuch as numbers of flowering, fruits location\
    \ in per plant and \nsingle fruit weight were all lesser with more density of\
    \ planting, \ntherefore, resulting in lesser harvests[52-54].  In another study,\
    \ Ilić \net al.[55] showed that in the tomato factory, by using red shade \nnetting\
    \ techniques the lycopene content highly increased, \nhowever, these fruits had\
    \ minor carotene content.  Maximum \nproduction of tomato by percentages of covering\
    \ are described \nunder 40% by El-Aidy and El-Afry[56] and 35% by El-Gizawy et\
    \ \nal.[57] Moreover, El-Gizawy et al.[57] claimed that by increasing \ncovering\
    \ intensity, the production of tomato will increase up to \n51%.  The soil surface\
    \ will lose its moisture in plants faster by \nabsorbing the more radiant energy,\
    \ but, the high density of \ntomato plants caused less radiation at the soil surface[52].\
    \ \n2.3  Efficiency of microclimate controller \nAn efficient greenhouse requires\
    \ environment control for air \nquality, disease reduction, pest control, and\
    \ nutrient and water \nuptake.  The inputs and outs of a greenhouse system are\
    \ shown \nschematically in Figure 3.  The quality of air is governed by \nfactors\
    \ such as air and root-zone temperature, humidity, carbon \ndioxide, air movement,\
    \ dust, odors and disease agents.  Other \nvariables in the greenhouse environment\
    \ that affect plant’s life are \nlight condition, soil feeding solution pH and\
    \ electrical conductivity.  \nThese parameters and the problems associated with\
    \ each have been \nextensively discussed by several textbooks, see for example\
    \ \nHochmuth and Hochmuth[58], Cherie[59] and Jones[60].  Plant \ngrowth responses\
    \ to other influencing factors and climate changes \nsuch as carbon dioxide and\
    \ wind speed have been discussed in the \ntextbook of Morison and Morecroft[61].\
    \  In general, microclimate \nparameters in a CEA are manipulated by passive and\
    \ active \nventilation, \nevaporative \ncooling \ntechniques, \nshadings, \nand\
    \ \nrefrigeration dehumidification.  Several methods based on the \nFans Assessment\
    \ Numeration System (FANS) for evaluation of the \nventilation performance and\
    \ suggestions for the energy efficiency \nof greenhouse fans are presented in\
    \ [62].  It should be noted that \nthe high operating costs of air-conditioners\
    \ make them impractical \nfor commercial application. \n \nFigure 3  Inputs and\
    \ outputs of controlled environment agriculture \n \nThe efficiency of active\
    \ systems, i.e., fan and pad evaporative \ncooling, has been widely studied and\
    \ modeled for modular \ngreenhouses that use mechanical ventilation[63,64], but\
    \ research \nworks on their use alongside natural ventilation in greenhouses in\
    \ \nsemiarid climates are narrow[65].  Reports showed that when \nventilation\
    \ fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan \nspeed and airflow rate\
    \ were respectively 13.1% and 30.1% higher \nthan those of original belts[62].\
    \  The same study also reports that \nthe daily average energy consumption for\
    \ the ventilation fan with \nthe original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that\
    \ with the \nadjusted belts when the pad was not working, and 24.2% higher \n\
    with pad working.  There are theoretical and experimental studies \nwhich compare\
    \ the effects of fogging and fixed shading systems on \nthe Mediterranean greenhouse\
    \ climate[66]; however, the assessment \nof mobile shading is not well documented.\
    \  In order to determine \nthe size of fans and pads for evaporative cooling,\
    \ the volume of the \ngreenhouse needs to be calculated.  An air exchange (m3/min)\
    \ of 1 \nto 1.5 times of the greenhouse volume is recommended every \nminute[16].\
    \  The number of fans should be selected based on the air \nexchange and by taking\
    \ into account that their placement should \nnot be spaced more than 7.6 m apart.\
    \  According to Duan et al.[67], \na properly operated typical swamp cooler has\
    \ the potential to cool \nair within 3°C to 4°C of the wet-bulb temperature. \
    \ These units \ncost less than air-conditioner and consume 60% to 80% less \n\
    electricity; however, they are only practical for small greenhouses \nin hot dry\
    \ regions.  Another form of evaporative cooling is \nmisting which reduces plant\
    \ moisture loss and leaf transpiration by \nreducing its temperature due to evaporative\
    \ cooling.  Misting is \n6   January, 2018                         Int J Agric\

    \  Vol. 11 No.1 \ncategorized into low-pressure and high-pressure (also known\
    \ as \nfog-cooling).  In fog-cooling systems, high-pressure water is \npassed\
    \ through nozzles with orifice sizes usually less than 10 μm.  \nA fan then blows\
    \ the extremely small droplets of water into \ngreenhouse air and reduces temperature\
    \ through an evaporative \nprocess.  These systems are usually used in greenhouse\
    \ cooling \nfor seed germination and propagation.  A major drawback of this \n\
    method is that it creates high humidity climate inside canopies \nwhich facilitates\
    \ the development of bacterial diseases, such as \nalgae and botrytis.  Several\
    \ recommendations for obtaining \nbetter cooling results with misting are available\
    \ in the work of \nSchnelle and Dole[68].  Low and high-pressure fogging systems\
    \ \nin a naturally ventilated greenhouse have been studied and \ncompared by Li\
    \ and Willits[69], suggesting that compared to the \nlow-pressure fogging system,\
    \ the average evaporation efficiency \nfor the high-pressure system was at least\
    \ 64% greater.  \nMoreover, the cooling efficiency of the high-pressure system\
    \ was \nat least 28% greater than for the low-pressure system.  \nDetermination\
    \ of cooling efficiencies for misting and fogging \nsystems is available in the\
    \ work of Abdel-Ghany and Kozai[70].  \nThe efficiency of an evaporative cooling\
    \ system is calculated by \nout\ncool\nout\nwb\nT\nT\nη\nT\nT\n\n\n\n as given\
    \ in the ASABE standards[71].  Here, Tout \nis the outdoor air temperature, °C;\
    \ Tcool is the temperature of air \nexiting the cooling pad, °C, and Twb is the\
    \ wet-bulb temperature \nof the outside air, °C. \nMeasurement and data analysis\
    \ for greenhouse evaporative \ncooling are discussed in the work of Kittas et\
    \ al.[72] A decrease in \nair temperature by 4°C to 5°C inside a greenhouse with\
    \ \npad-and-fan evaporative cooling is reported by Jain and Tiwari[73].  \nPerformance\
    \ of a two-stage pad cooling system in broiler houses \nwas analyzed by Petek\
    \ et al.[74] showing that the resulting air \ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ were significantly lower than \nthose of the traditional system.  A thermal\
    \ model for prediction of \nmicroclimate factors inside a greenhouse with mechanical\
    \ \nventilation and the evaporative cooling system was introduced by \nWillits[75].\
    \  Their results suggested that in the presence of \nevaporative cooling, increasing\
    \ canopy size is more influential in \nreducing air temperature.  They also concluded\
    \ that without \nevaporative cooling pads, the ratio of energy used for transpiration\
    \ \nto incoming solar energy (known as the evapotranspiration \ncoefficient) is\
    \ predicted to range from 1-75 for an outdoor air \ntemperature of 36.8°C and\
    \ a humidity ratios of 3.3 g/kg, to 0.8°C \nfor an outdoor humidity ratio of 29.9\
    \ g/kg at the same air \ntemperature.  In another study, Max et al.[76] investigated\
    \ the \neffects of greenhouse cooling methods, including mechanical \nventilation\
    \ and evaporative cooling, on yield and quality of tomato \nin tropical climates.\
    \  It was found that the proportion of \nmarketable yield was significantly higher\
    \ in a net-screen covered \ngreenhouse with mechanical ventilation, and the quantity\
    \ of \nundersized and blossom-end rot affected fruits was reduced in \npolyethylene\
    \ film covered greenhouse with the evaporative cooling \nmethod.  The researchers\
    \ then concluded that in regions with high \nrelative humidity, evaporative cooling\
    \ without customized \nadjustments for dehumidification will not improve closed-field\
    \ \nproduction of tomato. \nPassive cooling methods, including natural ventilation\
    \ and \nshading, are widely practiced in greenhouses, especially those in \ntropical\
    \ regions, by means of non-adjustable, manually adjustable, \nor automatically\
    \ controlled.  Natural ventilation is caused by the \nstack effect, wind ventilation,\
    \ or both.  Ventilation for air \ntemperature control is efficient only when outside\
    \ air temperature \nof the greenhouse is less than inside.  Some of the factors\
    \ to be \ntaken into account for designing of a proper naturally ventilated \n\
    greenhouse are the location of the structure, insulation, ceiling \nslope and\
    \ ventilation openings.  Various references have \nconcluded that using natural\
    \ ventilation, it is more difficult to \nuniformly distribute fresh air in wider\
    \ greenhouse structures[77,78].  \nA comprehensive review of ventilation systems\
    \ is available in the \nworks of Ganguly and Ghosh[79].  The air inlet and outlet\
    \ size for \nnatural ventilation are determined based on stack effect theory as\
    \ \nexpressed by the Equation (1).   The steady-state heat balance for \ndetermination\
    \ of maximum ventilation rate requires heat gains to \nbe equal to heat losses\
    \ and is given by Equation (2).  This \nequation is used to determine: (i) the\
    \ required ventilation rate to \nmaintain a given inside temperature for a given\
    \ heater capacity; (ii) \nthe minimum outside temperature (balance temperature)\
    \ to \nmaintain the desired inside temperature without using supplemental \nheat\
    \ (qh=0) at a given ventilation rate; and (iii) the size of heater \nrequired\
    \ to maintain the desired inside temperature for a given \nventilation rate and\

    \   7 \nmost popular greenhouse monitoring frameworks, the wireless \nsensor networks\
    \ (WSN), and the IoT based systems, which have \nredirected greenhouse measurement\
    \ concentration to a new level \nfor improving efficiency and viability. \n3.1\
    \  Wireless sensor networks \nResearch and development in greenhouses in the early\
    \ 2000s \nbegan to adopt wireless communication technology for monitoring, \n\
    sending early warning messages, and remote control using \nsimplified rules. \
    \ One of the earliest reports of WSN application in \ngreenhouse environment monitoring\
    \ can be found in the work of \nSerôdio \net \nal.[92] \n \nThe \ncompact \nsize,\
    \ \nreliability, \nand \ncost-effectiveness of WSN modules, as well as flexibility\
    \ for \ndeveloping custom applications besides easy installation, have \nmade\
    \ this technology gain attention and popularity for monitoring \nand control in\
    \ open-field[93,94] and in closed-field environment \nagriculture. \n \nSource:\
    \ www.AdaptiveAgroTech.com. \nFigure 4  General components and instrumentations\
    \ in a typical greenhouse environmental monitoring \n \nAn interesting application\
    \ of WSN in greenhouse includes CO2 \nmanagement[95] and multipoint measurements\
    \ of microclimate for \nmonitoring spatial gradients and three-dimensional changes\
    \ in \nparameters during the cultivation process[96].  For example, Ji et \nal.[97]\
    \ developed a WSN for precision control of CO2 fertilizer with \nan improved method\
    \ for prediction of tomato photosynthetic rate.  \nA computerized horticulture\
    \ data management system that is \naddressed in [92] was developed by implementing\
    \ WSN, controller \narea \nnetwork \n(CAN), \nand \nseveral \ninternet \nand \n\
    email \ncommunication tools, and was able to support distributed data \nmonitoring\
    \ and control inside the greenhouse environment.  \nMorais et al.[93] reported\
    \ the architecture of a WSN platform called \nMPWiNodeZ, a mesh-type array of\
    \ acquisition devices that was \ndesigned based on ZigBee multi-powered wireless\
    \ acquisition \ndevice for the purpose of remote sensing applications in precision\
    \ \nhorticulture.  A remarkable advantage of this platform is the \npower management\
    \ capability that allows the system to \ncontinuously operate in large coverage\
    \ areas where connection \nstability and power sources are a concern.  A simple\
    \ deterministic \nWSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and XMesh protocol for online \n\
    monitoring and control of air temperature and relative humidity \nwith several\
    \ sensors nodes that were placed inside the greenhouse \nin a uniform gridded\
    \ topology is presented in the work of Pahuja et \nal.[98]  The authors used a\
    \ network health analyzer and found that \nwhile the data reliability was 100%,\
    \ their network mean packet \nreliability was between 75%-100% due to the packet\
    \ losses.  This \nfailure can be related to the canopy coverage and sensors occluded\
    \ \nby the dense plantation which reduces the signal strength of the \nnodes.\
    \  This network was integrated into a multiple inputs and \nmultiple outputs fuzzy\
    \ logic based controller and an RS-485 \nactuator network to manipulate the greenhouse\
    \ vapor pressure \ndeficit.  Prima et al.[91] developed and evaluated a simple\
    \ and \nflexible remote environmental monitoring and control based on a \ncloud\
    \ platform.  They implemented a local-global management \nstrategy supporting\
    \ synchronization of online and offline system \nconfiguration, actuation, and\
    \ offline management to respond to the \nunstable network connection in the rural\
    \ area.  They tested the \nfunctionality of their system during a 10-day data\
    \ collection period \nfor automated monitoring of soil moisture content and fertigation\
    \ \ncontrol in tomato cultivation.  Their results showed that under \nunstable\
    \ network, the system only had 0.78% error, and provided \n99.2% in-range soil\
    \ moisture content measurement, which shows \nthe potential for long-term microclimate\
    \ monitoring application in \ngreenhouses.   \nAn important consideration in designing\
    \ of an efficient WSN \nfor the greenhouse is the number of nodes, their location,\
    \ distances \nbetween nodes, antenna and the operating frequency based on the\
    \ \ngreenhouse microclimate condition.  Studies showed that radio \nwave propagation\
    \ is strongly affected by the high greenhouse \nenvironment[99].  Several other\
    \ connectivity issues with WSN in \nthe greenhouse have been addressed in [100]\
    \ using connection \nmatrix to estimate the network connectivity in the disconnected\
    \ \nspots.  For this purpose, Chen et al.[100] established a remote \nmonitoring\
    \ \nsystem \nin \nan \nexperimental \ngreenhouse using \nZigBee-based WSN which\
    \ could monitor air temperature, humidity \nand light intensity as well as the\
    \ wireless link quality.  Their \nresults showed that by adding long-distance\
    \ backup routing nodes, \nnetwork connectivity can be guaranteed in the spots\

    \ based on star and mesh network \narchitecture for monitoring air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and \nsoil moisture content inside the greenhouse is available\
    \ in the work \nof Zhou et al.[101] More recently, Azaza et al.[102] presented\
    \ a smart \ntype-2 fuzzy logic based control system to manage the greenhouse \n\
    microclimate with attention to the effectiveness, the energy use and \nthe production\
    \ costs.  They integrated an observer and smart \nautomation system into the control\
    \ process by using a wireless data \nmonitoring platform enabling a distance data\
    \ measurement.  Their \nmethod also provided a real-time data access and building\
    \ database \nthat can be used for future enhancement of the system accuracy and\
    \ \ndecisions making.  The efficiency of their proposed monitoring \nand control\
    \ system was validated through a comparative study by \nevaluating the energy\
    \ saving (22%), and the water use (33%). \n3.2  IoT-based monitoring \nThe traditional\
    \ data monitoring techniques in greenhouse \nfrequently suffer from lack of sharing\
    \ and availability, great \nlabor-intensity, low spatiotemporal resolution, a\
    \ lack of data \ncentralization, and organizational management in observing the\
    \ \nenvironmental aspects of a greenhouse.  The IoT offers an \nexcellent opportunity\
    \ not only in greenhouse environment \nmonitoring but as a method for non-destructive\
    \ quantification of \nphysiological factors of the cultivated plants to be shared\
    \ within a \nnetwork of other greenhouse producers.  The potential \ngreenhouse\
    \ applications of IoT cover a variety of scenarios.  \nGeneral components of a\

    \  General components of a greenhouse environmental monitoring based in wireless\
    \ sensor network and IoT concept \n \nThe main element in the IoT is the network,\
    \ which has made \npossible a breakthrough in data communication and sharing for\
    \ \ngreenhouse monitoring and control.  It contains several physical \nitems,\
    \ software, and sensors that are linked with wires or wirelessly \nthrough standard\
    \ communication protocols[103].  Both academic \nand industry sections have shown\
    \ interest in greenhouse \napplications of IoT[104].  In fact, IoT has been used\
    \ in many areas \nof researchers, such as: smart city[105], agriculture[106,107]\
    \ and \nhealthcare[108-110], and is changing the traditional farming \nobservation\
    \ approaches by quickly providing quantitative data with \neffective spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution.  For example, long-term past \ninformation collected by IoT applications\
    \ can be an offer to a local \ngreenhouse community to conduct combined pest and\
    \ disease \nmanagement agendas in order to stop spreading of the associated \n\
    damages.  These data can also improve cultural practices and \ndecision making\
    \ plans[107].  An application of this technology can \nbe found in the work of\
    \ Liao et al.[111] who developed an IoT \nmonitoring system to simultaneously\
    \ screen the growth condition \nof Phalaenopsis and the environmental features\
    \ of an orchid plant \nfactory.  For example, Peng et al.[112] showed that by\
    \ using a \nspectroscopic and spectrometer investigation can correctly provide\
    \ \nthe total of orchid chlorophyll.   \nMoreover, Lin and Hsu[113] applied a\
    \ chlorophyll fluorometer \nin their study.  The monitored the photosynthetic\
    \ status of \nPhalaenopsis under diverse lighting situations.  Although the \n\
    physiological analysis is often occupied manually, these \nexamination approaches\
    \ need tools with perfect accuracy to \nnondestructively \ndegree \nphysiological\
    \ \nfactors \nof \norchids.  \nFurthermore, because of the cost, farmers will\
    \ not use highly \nprecise tools to measure physiological factors of orchids.\
    \  With \nscalability and flexibility of IoT, growers can have an excellent \n\
    opportunity to meet such observing demands[109]. \n4  Environmental control and\
    \ energy optimization \nThis section reviews some of the recently published works\
    \ on \nthe advances in microclimate modeling and control, greenhouse \nenergy\

    \ \nachieve stability by minimizing the error between references and \nthe inputs.\
    \  The control of the microclimate in a greenhouse is a \nhigh-level task because\
    \ of the number of involved variables that are \ncoupled and interrelated, making\
    \ a complex non-linear system.   \nSome of the earlier attempts to apply advanced\
    \ control \nJanuary, 2018           Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse\

    \   9 \ntechniques for greenhouse environment can be found in the works \nof Caponetto\
    \ et al.[114], Pan et al.[115], Lin[116], Castañeda-Miranda et \nal.[117] and\
    \ Xu et al.[118] Recent advances in computer simulation \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ have worked their way into greenhouse \nenvironment modeling and predictions.\
    \  Identifications and \nmodellings of different parameters in greenhouses have\
    \ been topics \nof numerous research works that aimed at improving production\
    \ \nefficiency (i.e., higher yield and quality, maximum return) by \nevaluating\
    \ and adjusting microclimate parameters and modeling of \nmicrometeorology[119,120].\
    \  The level of approaches vary from \nsimple models and timer-based feedback\
    \ controls[121,122] to more \nadvanced solutions, such as model-free control strategy[123],\
    \ \nnonlinear control methods[124], adaptive control and adaptive \nmanagement\
    \ framework[120,125], robust[126], optimal control[127-132], \nenergy balance\
    \ models[133], and model-based predictive control[134].  \nAn important drawback\
    \ in utilizing advanced control methods in a \nCEA is the difficulty in developing\
    \ the dynamic model to simulate \nthe behavior of the variables.  Ultimately,\
    \ the goal of any of these \ncontrol systems is to minimize the input cost per\
    \ unit of production \nand to increase the return by achieving high yield and\
    \ quality. \nThe success of greenhouse systems analysis relies on the \neffective\
    \ use of information.  To meet these requirements, various \ncontrol strategies\
    \ based on complex algorithms of artificial \nintelligence have been discussed\
    \ in the literature.  For example, \nfuzzy systems have achieved significant results\
    \ in the area of \nprecision irrigation[135] and microclimate control.  Several\
    \ \ntechniques and approaches have been presented, including \ninverting \nfuzzy\
    \ \nmodel[136], \nreconfigurable \nadaptive \nfuzzy \nfault-hiding \ncontrol[137],\
    \ \nTakagiSugeno \nfuzzy \nmodeling[138], \nconventional fuzzy logic control for\
    \ smart greenhouses[102], and \ndecentralized decoupling fuzzy logic controller[139].\
    \  These \nsolutions have shown a more effective set-point tracking compared \n\
    with \nthe \nconventional \nPID \ncontrollers. \n \nFor \nexample, \nEl-Madbouly\
    \ et al.[137] designed an active fault-tolerant control \nsystem to fix of the\
    \ device or sensor errors in weather system of a \ngreenhouse.  This control scheme\
    \ involves a self-tuned fuzzy \nproportional-integral \n(PI) \ncontrol \nscheme,\
    \ \na \nstrong \nfault-hiding-based reconfigurable controller that can fix the\
    \ faulty \neffects, and a reliable and sensitive observer-based fault detection\
    \ \nand diagnosis (FDD) system for diverse kinds of errors in the \npresence of\
    \ scheme disorderliness.  A set of practical actuators \nand sensors were applied\
    \ in this method to renovate the closed-loop \nconsistency and also to confirm\
    \ correct tracking of resource inputs.  \nAzaza et al.[102] introduced a smart\
    \ fuzzy logic based control \nscheme and upgraded by a special measure to the\
    \ humidity \nrelationship and temperature.  Also, the scheme control was \nimproved\
    \ with wireless information observing platform for \ninformation routing and logging\
    \ which prepares actual time of \ninformation entree. \n4.2  Energy analysis and\
    \ optimization models \nEnergy management strategies for optimizing greenhouse\
    \ \ncost[104] require a comprehensive research and knowledge and \nunderstanding\
    \ of climate condition, greenhouse systems, and \nplants’ requirements.  Some\
    \ of these research involves practicing \ninnovative concepts of energy conservation\
    \ and clean-energy using \nmathematical models[141,142], determining energy load\
    \ using \nbuilding energy simulation models[143], computational fluid \ndynamics\
    \ method[119,144,145], or providing optimal growth condition \nwith \nminimum\
    \ \nenvironmental \nimpacts[120,146,147]. \n \nOther \nresearchers have proposed\
    \ optimization methods for maximizing \nthe returns.  See for example the works[148]\
    \ in which a dynamic \nmodel of a greenhouse tomato and the optimal control problem\
    \ for \nthe seasonal benefit of the grower has been presented.  A \nformulation\
    \ of the optimal control problem for minimizing energy \ninput to the greenhouse\
    \ with a dynamic energy balance was \npresented by van Beveren et al.[149] and\
    \ later expanded in [150] to \ninclude humidity balance.  Incrocci et al.[151]\
    \ proposed that \noptimal CO2 concentration in the greenhouse can be based on\
    \ an \neconomic evaluation.  To maintain a given CO2 concentration \nwithin the\
    \ greenhouse, the supply must balance the assimilated CO2 \nflux to the outside\
    \ air due to ventilation.  Linker et al.[152] \noptimized greenhouse operation\
    \ and in particular CO2 control, \nusing a neural network.  Most of these approaches\
    \ have used crop \nmodels and prices of the harvested product.  van Beveren et\
    \ al.[153] \nexpanded this process further by including a dynamic CO2 balance.\
    \  \nThey reported a method to minimize the total energy that is \nrequired to\
    \ heat and cool a greenhouse.  Their research provides a \nmodel to define bounds\
    \ for temperature, humidity, CO2 \nconcentration, the maximum amount of CO2 available,\
    \ and the \neffect of different bounds on optimal energy input.  The addition\
    \ \nof the dynamic CO2 balance provides a truly integrated approach \nthat takes\
    \ all major aspects of greenhouse climate control into \naccount.  This is important,\
    \ given the trade-off between natural \nventilation and the injection of industrial\
    \ CO2, which occurs in a \ngreenhouse with active cooling.  Nadal et al.[154]\
    \ presented an \nenergy and environmental assessment for a roof-top greenhouse\
    \ \nand showed that their greenhouse achieved an annual saving in CO2 \nemissions\
    \ of 113.8 kg/m2 per year, relative to an equivalent \noil-heated greenhouse.\
    \  Vadiee and Martin[155] developed a \ntheoretical model using TRNSYS to carry\
    \ out greenhouse energy \nanalysis.  From the economic feasibility assessment,\
    \ their results \nshowed that the concept has the potential of becoming cost \n\
    effective.  A literature survey on greenhouse energy analysis[156] \nhas concluded\
    \ that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on \nthe micro-climate[156,157].\
    \  This is true since the amount of \nmoisture that is added to the greenhouse\
    \ environment due to \nevapotranspiration helps moderate the vapor pressure deficit.\
    \ \nCurrent advances in CEA systems tend towards sustainability \nand utilizing\
    \ renewable energy by studying wind power, solar \nthermal applications[142] and\
    \ solar energy conservation[141] to \nreduce fuel consumption[158].  For example,\
    \ in tropical and \nsubtropical conditions, the strategy in microclimate control\
    \ is to \nimprove resource efficiency by benefiting from the potentials of \n\
    natural ventilation and shading[120].  In fact, studies of different \ncontrol\
    \ strategies indicated that smart management of natural \nventilation for manipulating\
    \ the environment under specific \nexterior conditions is an effective approach\
    \ to improve productivity \nand increase benefits[124].  A smart tropical greenhouse\
    \ that \noperates on solar panels and benefits from an adaptive design and \n\
    covering materials (i.e., mesh screens) will maximize the use of \nnatural and\
    \ mechanical ventilation[144, 159-162] and will be less \ndependent \non \nhigher-cost\
    \ \ncooling \nmethods \nsuch \nas \nevaporative[67,163-167] and high pressure\
    \ fogging systems[168].  \nNevertheless, the use of anti-insect screens decreases\
    \ the natural \nventilation capacity and aggravates thermal conditions.  It is\
    \ \ntherefore unrealistic to completely eliminate other means of cooling, \n10\

    \  A comprehensive \nreview of advances in greenhouse microclimate control and\
    \ \nautomation system for tropical regions is available in [169]. \n4.3  Environment\
    \ prediction and yield estimation models \nGreenhouse growers use prediction tools\
    \ for the weather \nforecast, photosynthesis predictions for plant growth progress[170],\
    \ \npredicting disease[171], simulation of yield[172], and production \nplanning\
    \ and cost-benefit analysis.  Some of the earlier examples \nof climate models\
    \ to predict the temperature and humidity inside a \ngreenhouse can be found in\
    \ the works of [7, 173-176].  A thermal \nmodel for prediction of microclimate\
    \ factors inside a greenhouse \nwith mechanical ventilation and an evaporative\
    \ cooling system was \nintroduced by Willits[75].  More recent mathematical models\
    \ for \npredicting greenhouse microclimate from external data have been \naddressed\
    \ in [121, 177-180].  An innovative air temperature \nprediction model based on\
    \ least squares and support vector \nmachine with optimized parameters using an\
    \ improved particle \nswarm optimization (IPSO) technique is presented in [181].\
    \  The \nauthors compared and validated the performance of their model \nwith\
    \ conventional modeling techniques by predicting the air \ntemperature in a solar\
    \ greenhouse.  Another example is KASPRO, \nan advanced dynamic model for microclimate\
    \ prediction in \ngreenhouses[176,182].  This model consists of sub-functions\
    \ based \non mass and energy balance of the greenhouse environment.  A \ndetailed\
    \ description of this model is presented in the work of \nRigakis et al.[78] This\
    \ model was used by Graamans et al.[183] to \ndescribe crop transpiration and\
    \ energy balance in plant factories by \ndetermining vapor flux and the relation\
    \ between latent and sensible \nheat exchange for production of lettuce. \nSustainable\
    \ development of modern greenhouse production \nsystems also requires yield estimation\
    \ models and knowledge- \nbased information software for adaptive management of\
    \ resources.  \nSince it is impossible to actually plant and experiment with every\
    \ \nsingle greenhouse design and climate scenario, mathematical \nmodels for simulation\
    \ of yields and growth responses are \nessential for achieving high yield at low\
    \ cost.  These models can \nalso contribute to the optimization and management\
    \ of \ngreenhouse energy under adverse climate conditions.  An early \nexample\
    \ includes the work of Gary et al.[184] in which an \neducational software called\
    \ SIMULSERRE for simulating \ngreenhouse plant system was developed.  Some of\
    \ the \nwell-known simulation models for tomato plants include \nTOMSIM[185],\
    \ TOMPOUSSE[186,187] and TOMGRO[188,189].  A \ncommon weakness with these models\
    \ is that their parameters are \nspecific for the climate condition and greenhouse\
    \ design that they \nwere derived from.  In addition, because of the complexity\
    \ of \nthe interactions between the greenhouse elements and the crop \nitself,\
    \ it is often impossible to correctly predict microclimate \neffects on the final\
    \ yield with the same model parameters.  One \nof the most widely accepted yield\
    \ simulation models is the \nTOMGRO[189] in which the author claimed that “it\
    \ is possible to \nuse the same reduced model with parameters estimated at one\
    \ \nlocation to simulate leaf area and above-ground weight of tomato \ngrowing\
    \ in greenhouse conditions in other locations”.  The first \nversion of TOMGRO[188]\
    \ and the third version[190], respectively \nhad 69 and 574 state variables for\
    \ simulation of tomato growth on \nthe basis of three inputs that are measured\
    \ inside greenhouse \nenvironment: \nthe \nphotosynthetically \nactive \nradiation,\
    \ \nmmol/(m2·s), air temperature, °C and CO2 concentration, ppm.  \nA simplified\
    \ version of TOMGRO[189] was developed with the \nobjective of providing a practical\
    \ application and only has five \nsteady-state variables: (i) node number for\
    \ the main stem, (ii) leaf \narea index, (iii) total plant dry weight (WT), (iv)\
    \ total fruit dry \nweight (WF), and (v) mature fruit dry weight (WM).  Jones\
    \ et \nal.[189] provided simulation results for three tomato varieties \nincluding\
    \ DeRuiters, Beefsteak, and Bigboy respectively for three \nexperiment locations\
    \ at Gainesville (Florida), Avignon (France) \nand Lake City (Florida).  Some\
    \ of the studies related to \nevaluation and adaptation of TOMGRO model to specific\
    \ climate \nconditions and cultural practices can be found in the works of \n\
    [172, 191, 192].  It should be noted that the simplified \nTOMGRO model only takes\
    \ into account the effect of air \ntemperature and light condition, and other\
    \ important variables \nsuch as CO2 concentration were not included in this version.\
    \  In \naddition, Jones et al.[189] did not take the work any farther than \n\
    making the model calculations in an Excel spreadsheet, hence the \nmodel could\
    \ not be used directly with other models to control \ngreenhouse environments.\
    \  To fill this gap, Shamshiri et al.[193] \nevaluated and verified the performance\
    \ of the reduced state \nvariable version of TOMGRO model of Jones et al.[189]\
    \ using \nboundary data that were expected to result in zero yield output.  \n\
    The hypothesis was to test whether the model parameters are \nrobust enough to\
    \ translate an adverse greenhouse environment \n(with air temperature so high\
    \ to prevent any crop growth \ndevelopment) to realistic biomass and yield.  For\
    \ this purpose, \nShamshiri et al.[193] converted the model from spreadsheets\
    \ \nformat to Matlab Simulink (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, \nUSA), provided\
    \ a user interface to access the TOMGRO inputs \nand outputs, and replaced the\
    \ lengthy calculation procedures of \nMicrosoft Excel with one-click step operation\
    \ in Matlab.  This \nSimulink model of Shamshiri et al.[193] provided a flexible\
    \ \nplatform for individuals unfamiliar with computer programming \nlanguages\
    \ and crop modeling to have an easy access to the \nTOMGRO model functionality.\
    \  It was shown that the designed \nSimulink model can be used reliably as a replacement\
    \ for the \nspreadsheet version of TOMGRO model.  Additional research \nworks\
    \ with experimental and simulated based studies for \ninvestigating the effects\
    \ of structure design, covering materials \nand \ncontrol \nsystems \non \ngreenhouse\
    \ \nmicroclimate, \ncrop \ntranspiration, and expected yields are available in\
    \ the works of \n[51, 55, 76, 120, 193, 194]. \n4.4  Decision support systems\
    \ \nThe management of production in a greenhouse requires \ndecision making on\
    \ several tasks and time scales.  These \ndecisions are mainly related to management\
    \ of the crop growth \nconditions[195], the culture period and practice such as\
    \ seedling \nproduction[196], event-based irrigation[197] and the control and\
    \ \nmanagement \nof \nenvironment \nbased \ngrowth \nmodels[198].  \nResearch\
    \ and development in decision support system (DSS) for \ngreenhouse application\
    \ began during the 1990s, primarily for \nrecommending microclimate reference\
    \ values and set-points, and \nfor pest and disease management.  Early studies\
    \ included the \nworks of Fisher et al.[199], Clarke et al.[195] and Sun et al.[200].\
    \  A \nDSS was built by Tchamitchian et al.[201] based on the \nJanuary, 2018\

    \ \nabout the climate control regime that can quantify the energy \ncosts based\
    \ on different control strategies.  More recent studies \ncan be found in the\
    \ works of Cañadas et al.[203] and Aiello et al.[204] \nAn interactive decision\
    \ support system (DSS) developed by \nShort et al.[205] based on the HYTODMOD\
    \ growth response \nmodel of El-Attal[206] is available to describe the optimality\
    \ \ndegrees of air temperature and relative humidity at five growth \nstages and\
    \ under three light conditions (night, sun and cloud).  \nThese functions were\
    \ tested and validated by four independent \nexpert growers and were results of\
    \ experiments with tomato \ncultivar “Carusso” in an A-Shade greenhouse located\
    \ at the Ohio \nAgriculture Research and Development Center with a floor area\
    \ \nof 7.3 m2.  In order to build a model for defining the optimality \ndegrees\
    \ of VPD at different light conditions and growth stages of \ntomato, Shamshiri\
    \ et al.[207] integrated the growth response model \nof El-Attal[206] and developed\
    \ the OptVPD model (Figure 6) with \na series of membership function that take\
    \ VPD (kPa) as input, and \ngenerate a real number between 0 and 1 as output.\
    \  The effects \nof air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the \noptimality\
    \ degree of VPD based on this model are shown in \nFigure 6.  The knowledge behind\
    \ these functions and the \noptimal and failure microclimate values were condensed\
    \ from \nextensive peer-reviewed \nscientific published \nresearch on \ngreenhouse\
    \ cultivation of tomato and physiology, with the goal of \nsimultaneously achieving\
    \ high yield and high-quality fruit.  \nShamshiri et al.[120] extended and implemented\
    \ TOMGRO model \nin SIMULINK and interfaced it with the HYTODMOD and \nOptVPD\
    \ for microclimate evaluation and yield estimation (Figure \n7).  The interfaced\
    \ HYTODMOD, OptVPD, and TOMGRO \nmodels can be used as a DSS tool for evaluation\
    \ purpose by \nexploring \noptimality \ndegrees \nof \nthe \nmicroclimate \nand\
    \ \nmacroclimate parameters as well as yield estimation depending \non the growth\
    \ stage of the plant and different light condition.  It \nallows growers to manually\
    \ change the values of the growing \nparameters as well as the growth stages and\
    \ receive a feedback by \nmeans of a number between 0 and 1 representing how close\
    \ that \nparameter is to high yield and high quality.  An application of \nthis\
    \ DSS has been presented for dynamic assessment[208], \nmeasuring optimality degrees[46],\
    \ and comparative evaluation of \nmicroclimate parameters[193] in greenhouses\
    \ with different \ncovering materials.  Microclimate evaluation with VPD \ninfluences\
    \ the energy costs involved in greenhouse cultivation \nand must be taken into\
    \ account in humidity and temperature \ncontrol algorithms.  A more in-depth analysis\
    \ and practical \nexamples of this DSS is presented by Shamshiri et al.[120] via\
    \ an \nadaptive management framework.  This framework provides a \nflexible platform\
    \ for altering each participating variables in the \ngreenhouse.  It simulates\
    \ growth and environment responses in \ndifferent light condition, growth stages,\
    \ growing season and \nlocation.  The result is a cost-benefit analysis that shows\
    \ at what \nlevel each combination of variables is close to the optimal \nrequirements.\

    \ (UA) \nThe fast growth of global population is changing the food \nproduction\
    \ systems to keep up with the growing demands.  \nAgricultural innovation and\
    \ research in the past three decades, \ncombined with the advances in information\
    \ technology have \nintroduced promising cultivation techniques that are valuable\
    \ for \nsustainability and economic viability of CEA.  Ellis[209] described \n\
    that throughout the history, agriculture has always been associated \nwith urban\
    \ centers, much more than it is imagined today.  While \ntraditional and modern\
    \ agriculture have been separated in the upper \nlayers, they are still attached\
    \ to each other in the roots.  Today, \nfood, as well as animal livestock, is\
    \ surrounding us everywhere, \nand the question about the origin of this supply\
    \ is not a concern \nanymore.  By the late 2000s, major cities reached the point\
    \ that \nmost people did not even need to associate food with natural \nresources[210].\
    \ \nThe concepts in UA and the associated facilities have \nreceived significant\
    \ attention and popularity in the last 8 years, \nand are growing to meet the\
    \ needs of the ever-developing urban \nlife.  A variety of systems may fall under\
    \ UA concept in \ndifferent scale and possession (Figure 8), ranging from a personal\
    \ \nor local community gardens for social and self-sufficiency \npurposes, to\
    \ complicated systems which involve indoor food \nproduction with the help of\
    \ artificial light or inside factories that \nare capable of controlling the climate\
    \ to produce sensitive plants.  \nSince UA is mostly practiced indoors, it is\
    \ also referred as \nvertical farming (VF)[211], integrated farming inside buildings[212],\
    \ \nand Z-farming (which stands for ZeroAcreageFarming)[213].  \nThis type of\
    \ food production is entering all cities in the world and \nhas attracted public\
    \ interest.  There are new consumers’ needs \nfor fresh food of good quality with\
    \ no damage to nature.  \nSeveral reports indicated that more projects are involved\
    \ in \nbringing farming products into cities[214,215].  “UA is an industry \n\
    that makes, processes and markets food and fuel, mostly in \nreaction to the daily\
    \ need for consumers in a town, city, or \nmetropolitan areas, on land and on\
    \ water spread in the urban and \nsemi-urban area, by employing many methods of\
    \ production, \nusing and recycling natural resources and city wastes to produce\
    \ a \nvariety of products and livestock”[216-219].  In fact, UA is a \nfarming\
    \ movement in the cities for circulation of food and \nnon-food plants and tree\
    \ products.  Some of the suggested \nsolutions for a closed-field production system\
    \ in UA are the plant \nfactories, vertical farming (VA), and rooftop greenhouses.\

    \ a city center \n \n5.1  Vertical farming and rooftop greenhouses \nThe concept\
    \ of VF is not new.  Kaplan[220] explained that VF \nhas been unknown for a long\
    \ time, and was then brought to \nattention in the recent years through the advances\
    \ in technology.  \nLife magazine has published one of the very first sketches\
    \ of a tall \nconstruction that promotes agricultural products for people daily\
    \ \nfood requests as early as 1909.  In 1915, the American geologist \nGilbert\
    \ Ellis Bailey used the concept of the tall multi-story \nbuildings for indoor\
    \ cultivation.  He created the term “Vertical \nFarming” in his book with the\
    \ same title as “Vertical Farming”[221].  \nDesigners and landscape architects\
    \ have frequently looked into the \nconcept, particularly at the end of the 20th\
    \ century.  During the \n1970s until the early 1980s, the Malaysian-born architect,\
    \ Ken \nYeang improved and advanced the ideas of Bailey into an \narchitectural\
    \ project[222,223].  It is called Bioclimatic Skyscraper \n(Menara Mesiniaga)\
    \ that was built in 1992.  In 1993, Nancy Jack \nTodd and John Todd envisioned\
    \ the idea of VF in their book \nentitled “From Eco-Cities to Living Machines”.\
    \  The most recent \nand greatest challenging form of this idea however appeared\
    \ in \n1999 by Dickson Despommier’s, an Emeritus Professor of \nMicrobiology at\
    \ the Columbia University, speculating that a \n30-floor farm on one city block\
    \ could provide food for 50 000 \npeople with vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat,\
    \ explaining that \nhydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; and the lower\
    \ \nfloors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plants waste.  \nIn\
    \ the concept of VF, heat and lighting would be provided by \ngeothermal, tidal,\
    \ solar, or other recyclable sources of energy.  \nNitrogen along with other nutrients\
    \ would be sieved from animal \nwaste and maybe from the urban sewage system.\
    \  It should be \nnoted that until 2010, there was no report of evidence for VF\
    \ \nconstruction before it began emerging in USA, Singapore, Japan, \nand Korea.\
    \  In theory, VF is the technique that includes \nlarge-scale food production\
    \ in skyscrapers that makes rapid growth \nand planned production possible through\
    \ managing nutrient \nsolution of crop and the growth context according to hydroponics\
    \ \nmethods.  With the help of cutting-edge greenhouse approaches, \nthese buildings\
    \ can be used as a precision farming system that \npaves the way for the acquisition\
    \ of a safe crop growth through \ncontrolling and supervising of the microenvironment\
    \ using sensors, \ninterfacing gadgets and instrumentation[210,213,224-227]. \n\
    In the recent years, the majority of scientific publications in \nUA have focused\
    \ on different aspects of the VF concept.  For \nexample, Sivamani et al.[228]\
    \ studied the viability of smart \ntechnology used in agriculture as an opportunity\
    \ to be used for \nVF[228,229].  Research findings have shown that VF is a promising\
    \ \ntechnique for providing food for cities in a sustainable way.  \nHowever,\
    \ it is also a function of the location and design[229].  It is \nmentioned that\
    \ VF is a way of feeding and at the same time a \nmovement in the society to reduce\
    \ greenhouse gas emission[219,230].  \nA common debate about VF is the compromising\
    \ between the \nbuilding structure and the returns.  Some estimates that an \n\
    abandoned building can be adapted to the needs of VA, while other \nbelieves that\
    \ only buildings with new design will satisfy that need.  \nA study by Kalantari\
    \ et al.[231] presented several effective VF \nprojects in different countries\
    \ by estimating their feasibility and \nviability in various geographical areas.\
    \  The data was shaped \nbased on the technology of different VF in different\
    \ climate areas.  \nIt was shown by Kalantari et al.[231] that every VF has its\
    \ own \ntechnologies and techniques according to the different geographical \n\
    locations.  Table 1 presents the details of some of effective VF \nprojects in\
    \ different countries and shows the different areas by their \ntype of building\
    \ and typologies.  An interesting example includes \nthe conceptual design of\
    \ the Urban Sky-farm for downtown of \nSeoul is shown in Figure 9 with different\
    \ sections of the structure \nillustrated by labels.  This design was the winner\
    \ of the 2013 \ngreen dot design competition.  The key concept of a vertical farm\
    \ \nis to yield as much crop as possible under optimal circumstances, \neven in\
    \ the center of cities.  Thus, the VF shown in Figure 9 \nincludes many floors\
    \ with a variety of crops on each.  Different \ncrops need different environmental\
    \ conditions.  Therefore, tracing \na crop and its location is of a great significance[228].\
    \ \nVertical farms can be diverse from city to city and their \nstructures also\
    \ vary around the world[210].  The other two \nconceptual designs for vertical\
    \ farms are shown in Figure 10. The \nfirst design (Figure 10a) was designed by\
    \ ODESIGN group for \nAustralia. The other type of VF called urban farming units\
    \ (UFU) \nis shown in Figure 10b, a farm within shipping containers that can \n\
    produce organic fish, fruits, and vegetables in the street. The entire \nprototypes\
    \ are rooted in circular agriculture techniques. The main \ngoals of UFU are to\
    \ find a way to grow food under polluted and \nlimited ground[232]. Figure 10b\
    \ shows a conceptual design of an \nAquaponics farm with fish tanks that can be\
    \ placed inside or close \nto the plant in different levels of the farm.  In this\
    \ system, the \nplants clean and purify the water for the fish, and in return,\
    \ fish \nfeed the plants with their waste as a source of nutrients.  The \nFreight\
    \ Farms in Table 1 is also an example of a vertical farm in a \nshipping container.\
    \ \nAnother solution for UA is the rooftop greenhouse (RTG) and \nbuilding integrated\
    \ rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) concept.  It is \ndefined as a greenhouse constructed\
    \ on top of a building, usually \nmatched with soilless culture systems[233].\

    \ the greenhouse and building (i.e., energy saving), \nglobal advantages (as the\
    \ effect on climate change decrease), local \nadvantages (such as naturalization\
    \ of urban areas), integrations and \nadaptations with the building, as well as\
    \ production benefits \n(including the accessibility of high quality food).  These\
    \ structures \ncan optimize the energy, water, and CO2 flows only when the RTG\
    \ \nand the building are capable of exchanging air and can harvest the \nrainwater\
    \ or make use of the decently treated grey water for the \npurpose of irrigation.\
    \  Some experimental research indicated that \ni-RTG has failed to provide proper\
    \ light transmission[236], resulting \nin low radiation use efficiency (RUE),\
    \ however this issue is not \nconcerning RTG structure.  In comparison to traditional\
    \ greenhouses \nin the region, which are generally unheated, a primary advantage\
    \ of \ni-RTG is their better and more uniform temperature regime, owing \nto the\
    \ thermal links to the building.  This is an obvious benefit for \nenergy saving\
    \ over the conventional ground greenhouses.  Some \nof the examples of RTG farming\

    \ are usually used for commercial production of \nleafy greens, but their potential\
    \ remains uncertain.  A general \nstructure design of a plant factory and corresponding\
    \ components \nsections are shown in Figure 11.  In order to achieve economic\
    \ \nviability, the increased resource productivity and/or the value of \nadditional\
    \ services in these structures would have to outweigh the \ndisadvantage of the\
    \ absence of solar energy.  Plant factories have \nbeen primarily used in Asia\
    \ to refer to a commercial plant production \nfactory similar in operations to\
    \ an ordinary industrial firm.  Some \nof the technological instrumentations and\
    \ equipment supporting \nthese factories for deriving the plants to their maximum\
    \ potentials \nare precision sensors, nutrition solution, process controllers,\
    \ \nautomated instruments, computer systems, and environmental \nsupervision along\
    \ with implementation of DSS and task \nmanagement software.  Moreover, a number\
    \ of plant factories also \nbenefits from robotic systems for sorting, transferring,\
    \ and handling \nof the plants, as well as quality control, and post-harvesting.\
    \  Because \nof the relatively higher economic investment that is required for\
    \ \nplant factories, they are managed with resource efficiency and \nproduction\
    \ predictability to attain market-valuable crops. \nIn the Japanese context, there\
    \ existed 165 plant factories which \nare using artificially lighting combined\
    \ with natural solar lights[237].  \nAdditional sub-system might be required in\
    \ plant factories for air \nexchange to eliminate the temperature increase due\
    \ to the artificial \nlight.  Plant factories which have full artificial light\
    \ sources \nusually utilize opaque building materials.  This would offer a \n\
    chance to have the walls and roofs well resistant which makes \ncontrolling the\
    \ internal temperature easier and helps conserve the \nenergy.  Furthermore, often\
    \ the skin facade of the building is \ncovered by a self-cleaning and transparent\
    \ material such as \nEthylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE).  In addition, a material\
    \ \nwhich is highly clear and a high thermal rate are required to \nincrease the\
    \ intensity of sunlight that enters the building.  ETFE is \nlight enough as it\
    \ enjoys only 1% weight of an equal-sized piece of \nglass.  However, it lets\
    \ in 95% of light.  There exists a different \nintensity of pressure between the\
    \ ETFE layers.  Such a pressure \nhelps to close and open the screens so as to\
    \ change the passage of \nsunlight[209].  ETFE which is a standardized construction\
    \ material \nhas been used on an extensive surface of ethereal domes in the \n\
    Eden Project in the south of England[14,238]. \nStudies showed that quantitative\
    \ blue light was able to improve \nphotosynthetic performance or growth through\
    \ motivating \nmorphological as well as physiological responses.  Miyagi et \n\
    al.[239] showed that synergistic effects of monochromic LED \ntogether with high\
    \ CO2 and nutrients can enhance lettuce growth in \na plant factory.  Shimokawa\
    \ et al.[240] concluded that red and blue \nirradiation used at the same time\
    \ improve plant growth more than \nmonochromatic \nand \nfluorescent \nlight \n\
    irradiation. \n \nThese \nresearchers also observed that alternatively use of\
    \ red and blue light \naccelerated plant growth dramatically, with the fresh weight\
    \ of a \nrandomly measured plant that was found to be two times as much \nas the\
    \ usual LED production methods.  The bacterial biofertilizers \nused in plant\
    \ factories may positively affect plant growth in several \n16   January, 2018\

    \ \nFigure 11  General structure design of a plant factory \n \n5.3  Opportunities\
    \ and challenges \nVertical farming entails producing plants in a soil-less culture\
    \ \nwith nutrient solution and deals with problems concerning the use \nof soils,\
    \ including the need for herbicides, pesticides, and \nfertilizers and then it\
    \ supplies healthy organic food which is free \nfrom \nchemicals[213]. \n \nAnother\
    \ \nprivilege \nis \nto \nremove \ntransportation costs and CO2 production which\
    \ accompany the \ncarry-over of foods far away to somewhere near the consumer.\
    \  \nMoreover, products can be provided all-year-round corresponding \nto people’s\
    \ demand.  Furthermore, plant-production conditions \ncan be improved to increase\
    \ the yield by adjusting temperature, \nhumidity, and lighting conditions precisely.\
    \  Indoor agriculture \nin a controlled setting also needs much less water than\
    \ outdoor \nfarming as it involves recycling the graywater and lowering the \n\
    evaporation.  Together with the regulation of temperature and \nhumidity, it can\
    \ also decrease or omit the effects of seasonality.  \nFreshwater is increased\
    \ through the evaporation of black and \ngraywater in order to preserve water\
    \ resources.  Moreover, \nrecycled water obtained from rain can be innovatively\
    \ reused.  \nRecycling and dehumidifying strategies can be used for the city’s\
    \ \nwater supplies.  Similarly, aeroponic and hydroponic systems \ncan help raise\
    \ the efficiency of water consumption to 97% in \ncomparison to traditional agriculture[242].\
    \  Moreover, a constant \nflow of air is produced through air conditioning that\
    \ can be \nenhanced with carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to contribute to plant \n\
    growth even more.  Both environmental parameters and nutrient \nuptake may be\
    \ kept at certain levels that improve the speed of \nplant growth.  It was mentioned\
    \ that plants will have a better \nevapotranspiration and yield with the modification\
    \ of bandwidth \nof LED lighting.   \nUA, VF, RTG and plant factories provide\
    \ a unique opportunity \nfor reducing fossil fuels by utilizing solar panels,\
    \ roof-top wind \nturbines, or storage batteries[242,243] as shown schematically\
    \ in \nFigure 12.  The economic benefits of vertical farms include the \nreduction\
    \ of the cost of energy, lowering of food price, and an \neconomic opportunity\
    \ to secure land and return investments to the \ninvestor through protecting floods,\
    \ droughts, or damage caused by \nthe sun.  New job opportunities can be created\
    \ by VF in \nengineering, \nbiochemistry, \nbiotechnology, \nconstruction, \n\
    maintenance and research, with the chances to improve the \ntechnology.  Moreover,\
    \ the social benefits of VF are diverse and \ninvolve the psychological, and spiritual\
    \ health of the community, \nsuch as education, leisure, and more social communication\
    \ and \nhealthier food habits[213,242,244]. \n \nFigure 12  Conceptual design\
    \ for adaptation of renewable energy \nfor commercial development of sustainable\
    \ CEA and plant \nfactories \n \nSeveral researchers have claimed that, in a VF\
    \ system, the \nplants on the upper sections of the structure will only benefit\
    \ from \nsolar radiation, and that the energy supplied by the photovoltaics \n\
    solar panel may be restricted, or not justified cost wise[225].  \nHowever, solar\
    \ panels are now more efficient in generating energy, \nJanuary, 2018        \
    \   Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse automation and controlled environment\
    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   17 \nand the introduction of new affordable\
    \ and energy efficient LED \nlighting is an accepted substitute to compensate\
    \ the lack of natural \nlight.  We mentioned earlier that the LED sources are\
    \ capable of \nincreasing the yield in greenhouse context significantly because\
    \ of \nmatching spectral features with plant type and physiology[229,242].  \n\
    In addition, extra sun exposure is also possible through stacked \nlevels of plants\
    \ that can be rotated within one high-rise closed-space. \nThe extra cost of VF\
    \ start-ups can be resolved if the supporting \nstructures are not built on the\
    \ expensive central business districts, \nhowever there are still several challenges\
    \ with VF.  Indeed, the \nprimary costs of establishing, equipping and implementing\
    \ a VF \nare certainly high and are mostly accounted for energy \nconsumption.\
    \  The number and variety of crops grown is not as \nmany as in rural farming.\
    \  The quantity and loads of the crops are \nalso not as much as in the open-field\
    \ cultivation.  There are other \nchallenges too such as the need for disruption\
    \ management to the \nrural sector, to raise investment capital, and to train\
    \ workforce.  \nThese costs will be lowered through the time, particularly those\
    \ \nconcerning energy provision.  Abel[210] also mentioned that \nalthough establishing\
    \ VF is very costly at the beginning, but when \nit is well-established and fully\
    \ operated, the price of food will be \nlowered.  According to Despommier[14],\
    \ there are many \nappropriate locations for VF projects in every city and if\
    \ these \nlocations are used efficiently, they are able to return and circulate\
    \ \nlarge sums of money to the city[245].  It is concluded by Voss[246] \nthat\
    \ assessing all conditions on every level is essential, in order to \nthoroughly\
    \ consider all possibilities and then to decide on the \nestablishment of a VF.\
    \  Furthermore, VF as a concept is a \npromising move along the right path for\
    \ the fans of the \nrevolutionary resource-based economy movement.  Economic \n\
    analysis, along with the exploration of the impact of VF on \npost-industrial\
    \ cities can be topics of future studies. \n6  Conclusions \nUrbanization and\
    \ living in multi-story buildings request a \nredefinition of agricultural awareness\
    \ for securing food supply.  \nThe economic viability of traditional greenhouses\
    \ in this new \nscenario is likely to fade in the coming decades.  A trend in\
    \ the \npast 15 years of published literature showed that researchers and \ngreenhouse\
    \ growers have become more interested in shifting \ntowards smart controlled environment\
    \ agriculture.  The research \nconcentration has shifted from instrumentation\
    \ control and \nhardware-software interfacing to other scopes, such as simulating\
    \ \nthe interactions between microclimate parameters and plant growth.  \nResearchers\
    \ in this field are developing complex mathematical \nmodels to minimize energy\
    \ inputs, or are interested in finding \ninnovative solutions for replacing the\
    \ fossil energy consuming \ngreenhouses with energy neutral CEA systems that operate\
    \ on solar \nand wind power.  The main aspect that requires improvements in \n\
    this field is the task planning algorithms.  Path planning is well \nknown, but\
    \ to provide the CEA with an adaptive design and control \nstrategy that forms\
    \ the right shape and perform the right task at the \nright time, while increasing\
    \ profits and remaining competitive in \nthe market is still a challenge.  This\
    \ research presented an \noverview \nof \nmodern \ngreenhouses, \ncontrolled \n\
    environment \nagriculture and their derivatives, and highlighted some of the \n\
    advances in environmental monitoring, control, and optimization.  \nWhile biological\
    \ sensors, like those that measures plant stress are \nthe key to such high-level\
    \ of automation, this technology is either \nvery expensive for local growers\
    \ to afford, or even not available.  \nIn addition, it is not clearly well known\
    \ the cost of increased \nautomation relative to increase in profitability.  Therefore,\
    \ another \narea helping sustainability is knowledge based and decision making\
    \ \nsupport systems, i.e., model based computer applications that \naddress the\
    \ cost benefit for a proposed automation technology.  \nThis paper highlighted\
    \ some the most recent technological \nadvances for closed-field agriculture by\
    \ reviewing the applications \nof plant factories and rooftop greenhouses.  Some\
    \ of the \nconceptual designs in this context were introduces along with \nseveral\
    \ existing commercial examples to show the trends in \ndeveloping sustainable\
    \ farming system in the center of dense cities.  \nBased on the review literature,\
    \ this study concludes that a more \naccurate economic analysis and justifications\
    \ of the high startup \ncosts involved with vertical farming and plant factories\
    \ are required \nbefore large-scale commercial development.  The computer \nsimulation\
    \ models and adaptive analysis software are already \navailable for greenhouses\
    \ and CEA systems can be extended and \nmodified for this purpose.  The cost of\
    \ increased automation level \nrelative to increases in profitability is a key\
    \ consideration, and \nshould form part of future study to justify the implementation\
    \ of a \ngreater level of automation. \n \n[References] \n[1] \nTing K C, Lin\

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest
    The authors declare no conflict of interest. Acknowledgment This work has received

    all metrics Abstract Presently, wireless sensor network (WSN) plays important
    role in engineering, science, agriculture and many other field like surveillance,
    military applications, smart cars etc. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the
    field in which WSN is widely adopted. The aim of the adoption of WSNs in PA is
    to measure the different environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, PH value of soil etc., for enhancing the quantity and quality of
    crops. Further, the WSNs are also helped to reduce the consumptions of the natural
    resources used in farming. Hence, the aim of this review is to identify the various
    WSNs technologies adopted for precision agriculture and impact of these technologies
    to achieve smart agriculture. This review also focuses on the different environmental
    parameters like irrigation, monitoring, soil properties, temperature for achieving
    precision agriculture. Further, a detailed study is also carried out on different
    crops which are covered using WSNs technologies. This review also highlights on
    the different communication technologies and sensors available for PA. To analyze
    the impact of the WSNs in agriculture field, several research questions are designed
    and through this review, we are tried to find the solutions of these research
    questions. Similar content being viewed by others Wireless Sensor Network in Agriculture:

    on Wireless Sensor Networks and Instrumentation Techniques for Smart Agriculture
    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the networks
    which are composed of sensor nodes. These sensor nodes help in sensing, gathering
    and measuring the information from the surroundings where they are deployed and
    transmit the data to the users. A WSN has small or we can say no infrastructure
    and having number of sensor nodes in it from ten to thousands which works together
    to monitor a area where they are deployed.WSN are classified into two categories
    structured and unstructured. Structured WSN are those which are deploy in proper
    manner into a specific area and can be easily configured if there is any problem
    in a senor nodes whereas unstructured WSN are those in which sensors nodes are
    deploy in bulk without any proper architecture these type of WSN are mainly found
    in those area where it is difficult for humans to reach easily and obtain data
    from that area. In unstructured WSN, it is difficult to take care of sensor nodes
    if they stop working or issue of node failure occurs. Wireless sensor network
    are classified into five types to monitor the parameters of surface of earth,
    underground conditions, underwater conditions, multimedia and to monitor the area
    by the help of movement of sensors. These five types of sensors are defined as
    Terrestrial WSN-In this type of WSNs, huge number of nodes are deploy into a surface
    of land that can help to examine the conditions of land. Underground WSN- As the
    name depict underground WSN are networks of sensor nodes which are deployed in
    caves, mines or underground surface for monitoring the condition of soil, moisture
    and military boarder monitoring. Underwater WSN- In this WSNs, sensors are deployed
    in the region of oceans, rivers for underwater surveillance. Multi-media WSN-It
    is a network consists of sensors nodes that have ability to store, process and
    access multi-media data such as video data, audio files and pictures. Mobile WSN-
    In this network, sensor nodes have the ability to move from one place to other.
    The application of such networks is military surveillance, monitoring of area,
    tracking of target, monitoring under water [1]. In WSNs, sensors are integrated
    with a radio transceiver and a set of electronics components which helps in transmission
    of data from source to destination. Sensor nodes have capability to organize themselves
    to create ad hoc, multi-hop network which helps in creating communication link
    between nodes. User can give commands to sensors; as a response of these commands
    sensors can transmit data to the user for example a particular limit of temperature
    is assign to the sensor with the help of embedded language if temperature exceeds
    from that assigned value than sensor provides information to the user [2]. 1.1
    Wireless Sensor Network in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is a crop
    management concept which allows farmers for managing spatial and temporal variability
    with in the agricultural field such as reduction of natural resources, irrigation
    management, production management, fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and
    real time data monitoring [3]. The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision
    agriculture is to enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for
    measuring various parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture,
    climatic condition, intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can
    lead to better production [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding
    various parameters and process the collected information for better farming. The
    significant role of sensors in agricultural field is listed below (Fig. 1). Fig.

    Full size image 1.2.4 Citation Criteria For this review, the articles published
    in SCI listed journals are considered. To collect the good literature review,
    several search strings are designed which are mentioned in Sect. 2.3. But these
    search strings are not capable to distinguish articles published in SCI listed

    articles taken from the individual journal. Table 1 Illustartes the categorization
    of articles with journals Full size table 2 Literature Survey This section of
    paper describes the literature survey of various research articles related to
    precision agriculture using wireless sensor network. This section includes various
    techniques, sensors, algorithms and sensor motes used for collecting information
    from agricultural fields. The literature survey on the usability of sensor nodes
    in PA is divided into three categories. These categories are (1) Monitoring of
    Crops (2) Irrigation Management of Crops (3) Environmental parameters for Crops
    2.1 Monitoring This subsection describes the works reported on monitoring of the
    crops. Sanchez et al. [6] proposed an integrated wireless sensor network as a
    solution for precision agriculture. This model can help to assimilate crop data
    acquisition, transmission of data from the end user and video-supervision task.
    The main objective this model is to secure the crops from intruders and identification
    of same in the agriculture field. The detection and identification of intruders
    are done with help of video surveillance. High consumption of energy and end to
    end delay problems are remain unsolved. The different hardware prototypes have
    been implemented for crop monitoring devices. The detection intruder is measured
    using infrared motion sensors and identification is consummated with the help
    of camera sensors. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a method to monitor vigor of the
    plant with the help of WSNs. In this work, the vigor of the plant is non-violently
    monitored through embedded and image processing technology. If unusual behaviour
    of a plant is identified during monitoring process, then warning message is sent
    to end users. With the help of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the field’s wastage
    of resources which are needed for cultivation of plant are minimised. Proposed
    method based on data fusion of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation helps in providing
    the well-organized way for monitoring the strength of plant in many phases of
    agriculture. Zou et al. [8] proposed an algorithm named as OASNDFA for achieving
    intelligent agricultural monitoring with minimum sensor nodes deploy in the field.
    The selection of location of nodes is difficult in hilly areas due graphical and
    weather conditions. This algorithm helps to find the suitable location of nodes.
    This algorithm works in three phases. The first phase considers the different
    relevant factor. In second phase, a mathematical model is designed with the help
    of relevant factors. The third phase consists of key points with maximum features.
    These features are computed through mathematical model. To address the vulnerable
    dynamic topology problem for monitoring the crops, Jiang et al. [9] proposed an
    algorithm based on tree topology, called dynamic converge cast tree algorithm
    (DCTA). This algorithm is employed within the monitoring system of WSN. The aim
    of the proposed algorithm is to obtain better data attainment for monitoring of
    growth of plant. The DCTA algorithm having three stages i.e. (a) routing which
    is based on dynamic routing (b) adaptable time slot scheduling (c) compilation
    and examination of data. This algorithm provides high data transmission between
    nodes. For real time monitoring of the agriculture filed, Kim et al. [10] proposed
    an WSNs architecture based on beacon mode with autonomous. This architecture provides
    the solutions for the problems like fire, intrusion attack, and lack of availability
    of resources. The proposed architecture is worked on the TinyOS platform and further,
    multiple beacon scheduling in the MAC layer with bop slots is considered. The
    dynamic address allocations and path recovery process for unexpected link is addressed
    on the network layer. The results staed that the proposed architecture having
    reliable transmission ratio for a real-time processing service like fire and emergency
    agriculture monitoring systems under heavy traffic environments. Intrusion attacks
    are one of the major issues faced by farmers. Because, intruders destroy the agriculture
    fields and leads to decrease in productivity. To address the same, Bapat et al.
    [11] proposed a wireless sensor network to protect farms from animal attacks.
    Sensor nodes equipped with PIR sensors, sound sensors, light flashers and RF module
    are deployed in agriculture field. Sensor nodes that are located near to boundaries
    of field detect animal entry and send information to the central base station.
    From the central base station, the information is sent to end users. To monitor
    the variability of nitrogen gas and biomass foe sugarcane crop, Portz et al. [12]
    proposed active crop sensor model based on WSNs. The results revealed that the
    proposed model is capable to indicate demand of nitrogen and biomass in sugarcane
    fields. The nitrogen sensor helps to detect the variability of biomass and nitrogen
    and preventing action can be taken for supplying the biomass and nitrogen into
    sugarcane crop. Reiser et al. [13] proposed WSNs based system for autonomous navigation
    of agriculture field. The proposed system comprises of location of nodes deployed
    in agriculture field and data attainment. The proposed system has advantages over
    the narrow transmission range of nodes. This system is effectively detected the
    faulty nodes. Smiljkovikj et al. [14] proposed an intelligent cloud based system
    named as Smartwine which monitors the wine production process using grapes. It
    works on sensor network platform having centralized server system which allows
    more than one users to use system simultaneously. The Smartwine system helps in
    decrease the cost of energy, water, resources and pesticides use for wine production.
    To monitor the agricultural production process, Diaz et al. [15] proposed a methodology
    which have seven phases that are (1) Study the condition of environment. (2) Design
    of sensor network architecture. (3) Role and Importance. (4) Implementation. (5)
    Simulation (6) Deployment. (7) Maintenance. The designed methodology represents
    the importance of wireless sensor in agricultural field and provides strong foundation
    for building applications with high productivity gain. To monitor the crops in
    green house and orchard, Zhu et al. [16] developed a monitoring system based on
    WSNs. The capabilities of the proposed system are evaluated using three different
    scenarios such as greenhouse, open farmland and orchard. The proposed system gives
    better reliable communication between sensors nodes deployed in agriculture fields.
    Further, it is also seen that rate of packet loss is significantly decreased.
    To attaining less management cost and high productivity in cultivation of crops,
    Srbinovska et al. [17] proposed WSNs based architecture for vegetable greenhouse.
    The developed system analyzes the various environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and light, for optimal conditions of crops. It is revealed that the proposed
    system would be able to improve the productivity and quality of crop. A review
    on infrastructure of WSNs for precision agriculture is presented in [18]. Further,
    in this work, a hybrid WSN model based on terrestrial WSNs and underground sensor
    network for precision agriculture is proposed. The objective of the proposed model
    is to reduce the human efforts for collecting agricultural information. It is
    seen that the proposed model provides information regarding agriculture fields
    more efficiently and accurately than existing sensor networks. To address approximate
    inference problem in agriculture field, Abouzar et al. proposed RSSI (received
    signal strength indicator) based-distributed Bayesian localization algorithm for
    message passing [19]. The proposed algorithm avoids communication overhead and
    minimizes computational complexity. El-kader et al. [20] proposed a precision
    farming solution model for potato crop [20]. In the proposed model, soil testing
    of land is done through sensor nodes whether the land is suitable for cultivation
    or not. This model also provides the facilities of better irrigation and fertilization
    scheduling to reduce natural resources. Further, it is noticed that APTEEN protocol
    is adopted for better routing paths. To monitor the parameters of soil, Georgieva
    et al. [21] designed a WSNs based monitoring model. The proposed monitoring model
    computes the different parameters of soil like temperature, humidity, conductivity
    and amount of acid. The arduino platform is used to integrate the different components
    of the proposed monitoring model. For providing better and qualitative connectivity
    and coverage of sensors in agriculture field, Kaiwartya et al. [22] designed a
    system for multi-metric quality measurement for deployed sensor nodes. In this
    work, seven metrics are designed for the sensor deployment and the optimal connectivity
    between the sensor nodes is measured. Lam et al. [23] developed a wireless sensor
    module for rural monitoring and precision agriculture applications. In their work,
    specification like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception
    ratio (PRR) of wireless sensor module was tested as compared with commercial products.
    The designed modules have capability to give optimal solution for real-world applications.
    Further, it can provide better applications for precision agriculture like reduce
    energy consumption of nodes, prediction of pest or disease and improved quality
    of crops. For better coverage of agriculture field, An et al. [24] proposed an
    effective technique for sensor deployment based on field information coverage.
    In this work, two polynomial-time algorithms are presented. The work of the first
    algorithm is to find the location of deployed sensors. Whereas, second is to identify
    the locations of relay nodes with minimum number of relay nodes in between source
    to destination. It is seen that the good trade-off between sensor nodes is obtained.
    To fruit recognition and disease detection, Lee et al. [25] designed a sensing
    system integrated with yield mapping system, sensors for detecting disease, devris
    detectors, an N detector for precision agriculture using ground and aerial based
    platforms. The proposed sensing system can measure the soil phosphorus detection,
    detection of nutrient in soil and grain insect detection with the help of NIR
    and RAMAN spectroscopy. To monitor the frost in vineyard, Valente et al. [26]
    proposed a collaborative system based on WSNs and robot. The aerial robot can
    be worked as dynamic node and it can be responsible for communication between
    agriculture field and base station. Further, in this work, UAV and WSN are combined
    for surveying fragmented crop fields. Zhang et al. [27] designed a remote monitoring
    system based on WSNs for collecting agricultural information. This monitoring
    system is based on ZigBee and GPRS wireless communication technologies. The agriculture
    data is collected through CC2430. The ARM9 processors are adopted to design base
    station. The proposed system is more feasible than other existing systems in terms
    of feasibility and it also conserve water content in agriculture field efficiently.
    Li et al. [28] proposed a monitoring system based on WSNs for greenhouse. The
    proposed system includes cluster of sensor nodes, base station and data centre.
    The JN5139 micro-processor is used for designing wireless nodes and further, ZigBee
    protocol is used for communication purpose. The proposed monitoring system is
    a low-cost, expandable and reliable model with better processing capability. Park
    el al. [29] designed an environmental monitoring system to prevent dew condensation
    in greenhouse. The proposed environmental system integrates the Bahrenburg formula
    to compute the dew point of leaves. Further, the dew condensation is prevented
    on the surface of crops which to prevent diseases infection. To monitors the environmental
    parameters, Carrascosa et al. [30] proposed an open source based hardware model
    for precision agriculture. The proposed model contains two main components i.e.
    hardware and software. The hardware component of the model is responsible to record
    environmental parameters, whereas, software component connect the device with
    data server. The characteristics of open source hardware model are low acquisition
    cost and less complexity for customization. Table 2 summarizes the work reported
    on monitoring of different crops. Table 2 Depicts the work reported on crop monitoring
    Full size table 2.2 Irrigation Management This subsection presents the literature
    works on irrigation management for the crops. To optimize the water content in
    agriculture field, Gutierrez et al. [31] proposed an automated irrigation system
    based on WSNs. The proposed irrigation system comprises of distributed wireless
    network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. It is seen that the proposed
    system is feasible, cost effective and also reduce the amount of water content
    needed to the crops. To address the drought and tolerance issues of crops, Levy
    et al. [32] developed a method for irrigation management and enhancement of tolerance
    for the crops. It is observed that lack of water, drought, heat and salinity can
    affect the production of the crop. With the help of proposed method, all these
    factors are analyzed and it is concluded that required amount of the water is
    supplied through the proposed system to the crops. Further, it is noticed that
    micro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems helps farmer to conserve water. To
    measure the soil variability, Hedle et al. [33] adopted spatio-temporal modelling
    with high spatial resolution electromagnetic and digital elevation method data
    layers for quantify the variability of soil. Wireless sensor network with high
    temporal resolution dataset is used to mould the vibrant nature of soil moisture.
    The proposed approach is more accurate than a multiple linear regression modelling
    because it helps in providing best implementation of a variable rate irrigation
    system. For efficient use of irrigation system, Hellin et al. [34] developed an
    irrigation architecture based on WSNs for agriculture field. The proposed architecture
    helps in describing the design, optimization and development of an application
    to reduce the wastage of water. Sensor nodes which were deploy in fields are of
    good use they helps in reaching the required moisture condition to maintain water
    electrical conductivity level of the irrigation system at desired value through
    which there is a efficient management of water resources in agriculture field.
    To optimize agricultural irrigation, Nolz et al. [35] developed an irrigation
    model for monitoring the status of water in soil. In this work, two types of sensors
    are applied for measuring the potential of water in soil. These sensors are deployed
    under thin layer of soil to evaluate the status of water. It is noticed that the
    proposed irrigation model reduce the necessity of water to the crops effectively.
    A decision support system is developed for effective irrigation management in
    [36]. The proposed system comprises of sensor nodes, actuation network and fuzzy
    logic. The proposed method can reduce the wastage of water using fuzzy logic and
    actuation network. Further, it is observed that productivity of crop can be increased
    using this decision support system. Kim et al. [37] proposed an efficient water
    management system based on WSNs. In this work, the conventional irrigation system
    is replaced through an electronically controllable system for better irrigation
    management in agricultural fields. The proposed water management system is continuously
    monitored using GPS. Zhao et al. [38] designed an irrigation system based on soil
    water content and temporal stability. Further, in this work, water content and
    temporal stability is compared using VRI and URI to identify the location for
    deploying soil water sensors. In this work, temporal stability of soil moisture
    is evaluated regularly. It is seen that proposed irrigation system changes the
    overall similarity of soil moisture spatial patterns. It is also noticed that
    consumption of water is significantly reduced. To investigate the efficiency of
    linear move installed irrigation system, Chavez et al. [39] proposed a method
    for remote irrigation monitoring and control system (RIMCS). The proposed RIMCS
    system contains the pulsing nozzles and solenoids. The proposed system is also
    capable to vary the water rate. It is claimed that the proposed systems can monitor
    the flow of water, pressure of water, location and agriculture field. To control
    the irrigation in agriculture field, Maurya et al. [40] proposed a novel approach
    based on sensor technology. The sensor nodes are continuously sense soil temperature,
    moisture and humidity in agricultural field and transmits this information to
    base station. Further, in this work, region-based static clustering approach is
    used to provide efficient coverage over entire agricultural field. The proposed
    clustering approach uses the fuzzy logic technique to select best cluster head.
    This energy-efficient protocol is also compared with existing protocol like EEHC,
    DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR. To precisely monitor environmental conditions Sawant et
    al. [41] proposed a system. The proposed system helps in addresses the issues
    like standardized way of data discovery, access and sharing of data across various
    distributed sensor networks through the adaptation of a framework based on OGC
    standards for sensor SWE. The proposed system is a cost-effective, standardized
    sensing system which includes functionalities like sensor plug-n-play, remote
    monitoring, tools for crop water req. Estimation and nutrient management. A WSNs
    based irrigation software system is presented in [42]. The proposed system is
    named as WISC. The designed system provides real time monitoring of fields and
    remotes access to in-field information through WSN for irrigation purpose. For
    the proper irrigation in agriculture field, Coates et al. [43] proposed an irrigation
    model based on WSNs with valve control. The proposed model can sense the agriculture
    field for irrigation as well as also control the flow of water. Hence, in this
    work, manual control of irrigation valves is replaced through automatic control.
    To automate the irrigation process, Nikolidakis et al. [44] proposed an algorithm
    with collaboration of integrated system. This algorithm consists of advanced routing
    scheme i.e., ECHERP and provides efficient utilization of energy required for
    sensor motes. Nagarajan et al. [45] designed a sensor mote for sprinkler irrigation
    automation system. In the proposed work, humidity, temperature and PH sensors
    are used to control the water content of the agriculture field. The ZigBee communication
    technology is used for data transformation. Further, the GPRS system is adopted
    for data analyses and storing purpose. The proposed system is capable to perform
    real time monitoring and control water supply. An adaptable decision support system
    is proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [46]. The proposed system integrates sensors
    for monitoring soil, crop and climate in agriculture field. Further, this system
    is implemented in autonomous closed loop zone specific irrigation. This system
    is more effective in terms of agronomic performance as compared to traditional
    agricultural practices. Kim et al. [47] proposed a novel water monitoring system
    for reducing depletion of water resources. It is reported that fine-grained consumption
    of water resources can help farmers to pinpoint waste, and improve efficiency.
    The proposed water monitoring system can conserve the natural resources and also
    to reduce the amount of water needed by a crop. Masseroni et al. [48] designed
    a system for soil water monitoring and irrigation management. The proposed system
    is implemented using Arduino based open-hardware device. This system continuously
    measures the water level in the soil, especially in the root area. Further, this
    information is used to decide the irrigation timings. The proposed system reduces
    the water consumption significantly. An IOT based smart irrigation idea is presented
    in [49]. This irrigation system comprises of environmental sensors, web services
    and IOT devices. The proposal has deployed sampling algorithm successfully which
    will provide constraints for the sensor network. A model driven control strategy
    for irrigation in agriculture field is presented [50]. The aim of the proposed
    strategy is to provide right amount of water at right place in an agriculture
    field. Further, a predictive algorithm is incorporated in the proposed strategy
    for measuring the moisture content in soil. Table 3 presents the work reported
    in literature on different irrigation management system for precision agriculture.
    Table 3 Illustrates the work reported on irrigation system for achieving precision
    agriculture Full size table 2.3 Environmental Parameters This subsection describes
    the recent study reported on various environmental parameters like humidity, temperature,
    soil condition etc., to achieve precision agriculture. Rossel et al. [51] developed
    a soil sensing technique based on characterization of soil and environmental conditions.
    The objective of this technique is to improve the production of the crop and further,
    to reduce the environmental effects on crop. This technique measures and monitors
    the soil physical and biochemical attributes for better productivity. To compute
    and plot the spatial variability of soil, Bernardi et al. [52] developed a decision
    tool based on soil properties, yield and liming. The aim of this tool is to compute
    the fertilizer need and economic return of an alfalfa pasture. The vesper software
    is adopted to measure the spatial variability of soil and site-specific liming
    and fertilizer needed. Further, the information of fertility of soil is computed
    using spring software. It is revealed that it is an effective tool for mapping
    and evaluating the spatial variability of soil. Kuang et al. [53] developed a
    NIR spectroscopy based calibration model to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance
    mode. This model is adopted to examine the different spiking strategies and spiking
    ratios. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using 425 sample
    of soil. The results stated that the proposed model provides more correct and
    accurate information regarding soil OC, TN and MC. To measure the electrical conductivity
    of soil, Parrilla et al. [54] designed a system using electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) based apparent electrical conductivity technique for olive orchards. In
    this work, both wet and dry soil conditions are taken into consideration. Further,
    it is seen that to check the efficiency of proposed model, forty-eight soil samples
    are tested for soil texture and soil water content. It is stated that in both
    situation (wet and dry soil), proposed model gives the same information. The spatial
    variation of soil phosphorus(p), magnesium(mg), potassium(k) have been investigated
    using geostatistics, conventional statistics and a geographical information system
    in [55]. In this study, total five hundred thirty-seven soil samples are collected
    for this experiment. It is observed that this model provides useful information
    for agronomic and environmental management for crops. To design a low water cost
    WSNs, Bogena et al. [56] have tested the applicability of different water sensors
    like EC-5, EC-20 and TDR for measuring soil water content. The experiment is performed
    both in laboratory and field. It is seen that in laboratory, the performance of
    the water sensors are almost same. But, in field, there is significant difference
    between the performances of the different water sensors. Authors claimed that
    EC-5 water sensor gives better accurate results among all other sensors and it
    is best suitable sensor to design low water cost WSNs. To measure the climate
    change mitigation strategies for ecosystem and agriculture, Knadel et al. [57]
    presented a study on the self organic carbon parameter. In this study, two different
    agriculture fields are taken into consideration and mapped using Veris mobile
    sensor platform. Further, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain different field
    of spectra. The objective of this study is to identify either a single sensor
    or fusion of sensors can provide best predictive accuracy for SOC parameters.
    It is seen that the fusion of sensors is obtained best predictive accuracy for
    SOC parameter. Further, it is observed that low cost robust calibration model
    can be developed on the basis of Vires mobile platform. A soil property monitoring
    system based on WSNs is presented in [58]. The proposed system is deployed in
    the wheat field to measure the soil properties. It is seen that proposed system
    provides more than 95% real time information of soil parameters. Ritsema et al.
    [59] developed a stand-alone wireless embed network system for continuous monitoring
    of water contents at different depths. Further, this system is associated with
    web application to display the real time results for end users. To monitor the
    soil moisture dynamics from top depth, Majone et al. [60] presented a multi hop
    WSNs based monitoring system for orchards. In this work, sensors are deployed
    on different depth level i.e. 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80 cm. The proposed system is
    based on independent sensors that can provide both real time and historic data.
    It is revealed that distribution of soil moisture can affect the production of
    orchards. To find the low cost sensor and better frequency range for measuring
    moisture content, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil, Kizito et al.
    [61] evaluated ECH2O sensors family in the range of 5–150 MHz frequencies. The
    results concluded that ECH2O-TE sensor gives the better results at 70 MHz. The
    relationship and precision between volumetric soil water content and volumetric
    soil water content sensed are determined through four commercial soil moisture
    sensor systems in [62]. It is revealed that only the IM and RB systems are identified
    the high corelation between volumetric soil water content and volumetric soil
    water content sensed. Brocca et al. [63] assessed the reliability of soil moisture
    estimations through ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors. In their work, fourteen different
    sites of four different countries is taken into consideration. It is stated that
    AMSR-E sensor provides the high correlation between the observed and modelled
    data using LPRM algorithm. A review on the soil properties using remote sensing
    technique is presented in [64]. To characterize the underground wireless network
    and the basic problems for better communication in agricultural field, Vuran et
    al. [65] derived advance channel models. The proposed model helps in analyzing
    bit error rate for two different networks. The results obtain from field measurements
    used in evaluating parameters of soil and the effects of variation in moisture
    of soil. To measure the temperature of agriculture field, Badia-melis et al. [66]
    evaluate the behaviour of various sensors under the three temperature ranges that
    are 5 °C, 23 °C and 35 °C. Three wireless sensor network devices with different
    sensors are compared with four RIFD tags to get the information of behaviour of
    various sensors. Two alternative methods were used to adjust experimental data.
    For monitoring and modelling temperature variations inside silage stacks, Green
    et al. [67] designed a wireless mote which is deployed at different location.
    The proposed system helps in detection of temperature variation during decomposition
    of silage. To obtain real time information about environmental parameters of greenhouse,
    Jahnavi et al. [68] developed a smart wireless system. The designed system helps
    in giving optimal use of resources and water required for cultivation of crops.
    Microcontroller in designed system helps in transmitting and receiving data from
    sensor nodes to gateway node. Users can get real time information of greenhouse
    through web application where data is transmitted through gateway node. To control
    the eexchange of water and energy of heat between the agricultural field and atmosphere,
    Jackson et al. [69] designed a temperature and moisture sensor. The developed
    sensors are composed of micro machined MEMS cantilever beams which are equipped
    with water sensitive sensors. The variation in resistance of the sensor due to
    moisture depends on the cantilever beam thickness. For measuring temperature of
    agricultural field, Martinez et al. [70] proposed a cost-effective system named
    as LITAS. The designed system evaluates infrared thermometry and thermal imaging
    which supervised water stress level of the plant. The LITAS system tested in the
    field of sugar beet and the measurements of LITAS were compared to canopy temperature(TC)
    which is obtain from thermal images. Pierce et al. [71] deployed a two WSNs for
    agricultural process, one wireless sensor network is designed for regional-scale
    applications, such as weather stations and the second network is designed for
    on-farm applications such as monitoring of temperature for protecting agricultural
    field from frost. To monitor physiological condition of plants, Mahan et al. [72]
    proposed a smart cop IRT. The designed system is cost effective which can be easily
    deployed in large areas and helps in providing wireless operations that are more
    appropriate in various research and applications. To monitor climatic conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and amount of soil moisture. In agricultural field
    Mendez et al. [73] designed a Wi-Fi based network which is capable to intelligently

    Technologies In wireless sensor communication various technologies are used to
    transmit the data from agriculture field to central point. The specification of
    these technologies is described in Table 5. Whereas, the WSNs communication technologies
    used in PA is given in Table 6. Table 5 Available communication technologies with
    specification for precision agriculture Full size table Table 6 Communication
    technology reported for precision agriculture in literature Full size table 1.
    ZigBee—ZigBee is low-cost, low-rate, and less-power consumer device as compared
    with other wireless technologies that helps in secure and efficient transmission
    of data from source to destination. By applying a wireless sensor network based
    on ZigBee to an agriculture field data regarding to the conditions of field is
    properly transmitted to the user at high data transmission rate [74]. 2. Bluetooth—Bluetooth
    is a small range, low-power consuming device for wireless sensor network which
    helps in transmit data from one user to other in a range of 100 meters. It operates
    on the frequency band of 2.4 GHz [75]. 3. Wi-Fi—wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is IEEE
    standard 802.11b for wireless local area network which is operated in frequency
    band of 2.4 GHz deploy in a distributed way to cover the range of hundred meters.
    Wi-Fi is the most successful technology of wireless sensor networks few years
    ago Wi-Fi was only available on laptops but now a day’s Wi-Fi is easily available
    in cell phones, cameras, TV etc. [76]. 4. GPRS—general packet radio service (GPRS)
    provides fast speed of data transmission to the users. It uses the frequency range
    of 2.4 GHz. GPRS provides faster and long distance connection for data transmission.
    Range of GPRS is spread up to kilometres according to the coverage area of GPRS
    [77]. 5. WiMAX—worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
    IEEE 802.16e standard used for a long distance communication technology. With
    the integration of WiMAX technology, the capacity of network can be raised up
    to 70 mbps [78]. 3.2 Sensors Used in PA Sensors provide huge contribution in various
    applications. In agriculture, sensors plays vital role for measuring various parameters
    of agricultural field. Tables 7, 8 show the different sensors that are used for
    precision agriculture. These tables also provide the details of temperature range
    and other capabilities of the sensors. Further, Table 9 illustrates the different
    sensor reported in the literature to monitor and measure the different parameters
    for achieving precision agriculture. Table 10 shows the list of different crops
    which are tested for precision agriculture using WSNs technology. Table 7 Sensor
    used for measuring parameters of PA Full size table Table 8 Sensors used for measuring
    weather conditions Full size table Table 9 List of sensor reported for precision
    agriculture in literature work Full size table Table 10 List of crops reported
    for precision agriculture in literature work Full size table 4 Conclusion In this
    study, the adaptability of the WSN is explored in the field of precision agriculture.
    It is observed that there is the incremental growth to adopt the WSN in PA and
    having wide range of the applicability. It is reported that WSNs are widely used
    to monitor agricultural fields, optimize irrigation for the crops, measure temperature
    and soil properties. In this paper, seventy-eight articles are studied and arranged
    these articles into three different categories i.e. monitoring of the crops, irrigation
    management and environmental parameters management. Further, this review also
    discusses the different communication technologies of WSNs available for precision
    agriculture in literature. A list of different sensor used in PA is also given.
    The major contribution of this literature to scientific community is given below.
    RQ1) From literature, it is seen that number of techniques/tools are designed
    by various researchers for PA using WSNs. These tools are IMOTE2, Arduino, EZ430-RF2500,
    MDA300 sensor board, EZ43-RF2500, MDA300, Indriya, MICAZ, ZKOS, MSP430, PIC16F877,
    CVX toolbox, MOSEK, Veris mobile sensor platform, MDA320, MTS400. These tools
    integrate the different sensors on it and collect the information regarding various
    parameters of PA and this information is used for decision making. It is observed
    that Arduino platform is widely adopted as a platform to integrate different sensors
    due to low cost and ease to embed. It is also seen that some algorithms are also
    developed for effective monitoring and smart irrigation of crops. These algorithms
    include OASNDFA, DCTA, BOP, LAA, distributed localization algorithm, range based
    localization algorithms, polynomial-time algorithms for deployment of nodes, electromagnetic
    induction algorithm, MLR, PCR and PLSR methods. Some of new communication protocols
    are also reported in few research articles like APTEEN protocol, Fuzzy based energy
    efficient protocol, ECHERP. It is also revealed that the Tiny OS and Tiny OS 2.0
    are taken as operating system for sensors. RQ2) In precision agriculture, large
    numbers of sensors are adopted for collecting the real time information about
    the growth of crops as well as different environmental parameters like humidity,
    temperature, soil moisture etc. All these information is collected through randomly
    deployed sensor nodes. Further, this information is collected on a central point
    for processing purpose. The processed information is used in decision making and
    action is taken according the processed information. Table 9 shows the list of
    different sensors reported in literature. This table also illustrates the significance
    of each sensor and citation details of these sensors are also given. The working
    of few sensors is discussed as Sensor s8000 measures the PH parameter, HYDRA-PROBE
    II sensor measure conductivity, salinity, soil moisture, and temperature values.
    EC-10HS measure the moisture of soil, EC-5 sensor for measuring soil moisture,
    SHT-11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, N-sensor for measuring the
    requirement of nitrogen to the crop, VH400 is a soil-moisture sensor which measure
    the amount of moisture present in soil, DS1822 sensor is used to measure the temperature,
    SEN-13322 sensors measure the volumetric content of water in the soil. It is found
    that PA cannot achieve without the help of these sensors. Table 8 illustrates
    the list of sensors used for measuring weather conditions. It is seen that in
    PA, most of works is reported on measuring the soil parameters. RQ3) Large numbers
    of crops are taken into consideration in literature to validate the applicability
    of the WSNs in agriculture. The aim to adopt the WSNs in agriculture is to monitor
    the crops, irrigation management and measure the different environmental parameters
    which are responsible for the growth and improved quality of the crops. Table
    10 demonstrates the list of crops which are considered for experimentation. It
    is found that eighteen different crops are taken by researchers to investigate
    the role of WSNs in agriculture. These crops include broccoli crop, cotton plant,
    orange orchards, orchid greenhouses, vinyl greenhouse, sugarcane field, grape
    farms, pepper vegetable greenhouse, potato crop, citrus and blueberry crop, maize
    field, wheat, peach orchards and many more. Further, it is observed that WSNs
    is widely used to monitor the growth of crops in green houses. RQ4) From literature,
    it is seen that five communication technologies are adopted in WSNs for PA. These
    communication technologies are described in Table 5. These are Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM and WiMAX. Out of these five techniques, only four techniques
    are used. Presently, WiMAX communication technology is not adopted in PA till
    date due to high cost and large size. Table 6 shows the various communication
    technologies cited in different research articles. It is concluded that most of
    researchers works with the ZigBee communication technology due to high transmission
    range and low cost and cited in twenty-seven research articles. The second most
    valuable communication technology is GSM/GPRS and it is cited in sixteen research
    articles. Apart from these, several points can be highlighted from this study.
    Seventy-eight SCI listed research articles are included in this study from thirty-five
    different journals. In PA, lot of works are reported on measuring soil parameters
    including soil moisture, PH value, soil temperature etc., for improving quality
    of crops. For effective monitoring and irrigation management, some algorithms
    are also presented by various researchers in the field of PA. Tiny OS and Tiny
    OS 2.0 are adopted as operating system for sensor nodes due to low complexity.
    It is noted that Arduino platform is widely adopted to integrate the different
    component of WSNs in PA. In PA, some work is also reported on communication protocols.
    Some of new communication protocols are developed for effective communication
    between different components of WSNs. This review also lightens on the communication
    technologies adopted in WSNs for PA. It is found that till date only four communication
    technologies is used. It is seen that widely adopted communication technology
    is ZigBee. A lot of crops have been investigated by using WSNs for precision agriculture.
    It is observed that vineyard crop is examined multiple times. EC-5 senor is widely
    used for measuring the soil moisture. Some works are also presented on the deployment
    of sensor nodes in agriculture filed. In few research articles, automatic irrigation
    model is also proposed and these models also reduce the human effort. Few of articles
    are reported on intrusion detection in the agriculture field. Hence, there is
    a scope of work in this direction. Lack of work is reported on the usability of
    fertilizers in the agriculture field. Abbreviations APTEEN: Adaptive periodic

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/

    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is currently shaping different aspects
    of human life. Precision agriculture is one of the paradigms which can use the
    IoT advantages to optimize the production efficiency and uniformity across the
    agriculture fields, optimize the quality of the crops, and minimize the negative
    environmental impact. In this paper, we present an IoT architecture customized
    for precision agriculture applications. The proposed three-layer architecture
    collects the needed data and relays it to a cloud-based back-end where it is processed
    and analyzed. Feedback actions based on the analyzed data can be sent back to
    the front-end nodes. We built a prototype of the proposed architecture to demonstrate
    its performance advantages. Published in: 2016 28th International Conference on

    IEEE Conference Location: Giza, Egypt I. Introduction Precision agriculture emerged
    in the late 1980''s with the matching of grid-based sampling of soil chemical
    properties with the newly developed variable-rate application equipment for fertilizers
    [1]. Since then, it became the main farming management practice worldwide. Precision
    agricultural services provide the means to (1) fight epidemic diseases by applying
    the appropriate types and amounts of fungicides, pesticides and organic fertilizers
    at the right times, (2) achieve efficient water consumption by watering the plants
    with only the needed amount of water and the right time, (3) reduce the harm to
    the environment since knowing when to spray a pesticide does not only lead to
    effectively killing harmful pests but also reduces the use of the pesticide, and
    (4) produce high-value agriculture productions by growing non-toxic, safe, and
    healthy crops. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\
    \ based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the\nmain circuit board of the\
    \ system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software\noptimization.\
    \ The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and\
    \ real farms\ncan be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile\
    \ application. Experimental\nresults are produced by testing sensor and communication\
    \ link effectiveness, and are subsequently\nvalidated in the ﬁeld through a one-week\
    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\
    \ smart agriculture; LoRa; LPWAN; sensor\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ such as the ability to control the water level or temperature level are\nthe\
    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\
    \ [14–16].\nTable 1. A comparisons of our model with existing literature.\nModel\n\

    \ work on WSN in smart\nagriculture, clariﬁcations on issues of water management,\
    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\
    \ block.\nFarm 1\nFarm 2\nGateWay\nNode 1\nSensor node 1\nNode 2\nFigure 1. Block\

    this power has to convert toward the expected form with normal voltage range for\
    \ storing power\nsupply to different kinds of devices in the IoT proposed node.\
    \ Based on the requirement of the\npower IoT system that the microcontroller and\
    \ the communication module need 5 V and 3.3 V for\nthe powering system with receive\
    \ node, respectively. It is necessary to include voltage regulators\ninside the\
    \ node. For that reason, two voltage regulators employ a 5 V regulator that powers\
    \ sensors of\nFigures 3–5 and a 3.3 V one which powers the powering system for\

    \ is combined of a LoRa module and WiFi ESP8266 module, and ATmega2560. Figure\

    \ how all device elements are\nconnected: the LoRa transmission module, WiFi ESP8266\
    \ module, ATmega2560, and power system for\nGateway. Figures 6 and 7a show the\
    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\

    \ 6. Electronic schematic of the Gateway and Node 1.\nConsidering all of these\
    \ previous technologies, there are mean ﬂexible options for the achievement\n\
    of IoT nodes. The most signiﬁcant selection has to be carefully studied as it\
    \ is easy to change\nthe hardware, implementation, and long-lasting quality over\
    \ time. The one recommended in our\narticle, which is a solution for the real-time\
    \ monitoring of controlling the level of water and resulting\nhypothesis, shows\
    \ as:\n•\nThe IoT node system is expected to be deployed for two nodes with the\
    \ distance between two\nnodes being a few km with complex terrain in rural areas.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of the system needs\nto reduce to the lowest level possible,\
    \ and the support services need to be optimized:\n•\nThe coverage of our system\
    \ to around tens of km2;\n•\nThe lower power consumption is composed possibly\
    \ for an adaptive data rate and changes\nthe output bit rate. Moreover, it depends\
    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n10 of 22\n(a) Gateway\n(b) Node 1\nFigure\
    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\
    \ between small energy\ndevices and a gateway.\nTable 3. Technical speciﬁcations\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ Node 2.\n3.3.1. ATmega328 Microcontroller\nAll of those sensors require the\
    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\
    \ rather than resistive sensing like other sensors on the market. It is made of\n\
    corrosion-resistant material, which provides a good solution for the user. Moreover,\
    \ the sensor is\nsimple to use—an analog sensor that works at a low voltage.\n\
    •\nRain sensor: LM393, this is an analog sensor that operates at a low voltage,\
    \ and the current sensor\nis for easily detecting rain [47].\n•\nWater level and\
    \ temperature pump: LM393 [48]; this is an analog sensor when the water level\n\
    reaches below the threshold in the tunnel farm and checks the sensors. Our system\
    \ communicates\nto the user and establishes a water pump to its switch on the\
    \ state for sufﬁcient watering of plants\nthroughout a mobile application.\nFigure\
    \ 9 shows the sensor Node 1 electronic schematic, and how total hardware elements\
    \ are\nattached: microcontroller, power, and IC circuit. DS 1307 is used to read\
    \ the real-time with the high\naccuracy, LoRa module transfer data via a serial\
    \ connection, and the module connection is used to\nconnect RF HC12, RFID RC522,\
    \ LCD, sensors, pump, and ATmega2560. Figure 10a shows an actual\nmodel of sensor\
    \ Node 1.\nBesides the hardware, before being discussed, sensor Node 1 needs an\
    \ additional device to\noperate. The general important thing is the power subsystem.\
    \ In the case of the nodes, it was selected\nto power the nodes. Note that, in\
    \ this situation, we also can be used by the power supply unit, which\nis based\
    \ on a 12 W solar panel. The solar panel is linked to the solar charge controller,\
    \ where a solar\ncharge controller manages the power going into the battery.\n\

    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n17 of 22\nresolution building certainly helps to enhance\
    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\

    \ humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried out\
    \ on Node 1 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\nData transmission\
    \ is also a crucial issue in the IoT smart system in checking the effect of packet\
    \ loss.\nData transmission is tested by exploiting a model created by internal\
    \ sensors. Node 1, Node 2, and the\ngateway are connected through a LoRa module\
    \ in the prototype as described in Section 4.1. Packages\nare lost from all test\
    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\
    \ 13.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n18 of 22\nFigure 15. Collected soil\
    \ moisture, humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried\

    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\
    \ water needs of plants.\n•\nThe results of the test and the measurement of our\
    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

    systems have entered the stage of commercial deployment, providing users with
    new services, improved user experiences as well as a host of novel opportunities
    to various industries. However, 5G still faces many challenges. To address these
    challenges, international industrial, academic, and standards organizations have
    commenced research on sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. A
    series of white papers and survey papers have been published, which aim to define
    6G in terms of requirements, application scenarios, key technologies, etc. Although
    ITU-R has been working on the 6G vision and it is expected to reach a consensus
    on what 6G will be by mid-2023, the related global discussions are still wide
    open and the existing literature has identified numerous open issues. This paper
    first provides a comprehensive portrayal of the 6G vision, technical requirements,
    and application scenarios, covering the current common understanding of 6G. Then,
    a critical appraisal of the 6G network architecture and key technologies is presented.
    Furthermore, existing testbeds and advanced 6G verification platforms are detailed
    for the first time. In addition, future research directions and open challenges
    are identified to stimulate the on-going global debate. Finally, lessons learned
    to date concerning 6G networks are discussed. Published in: IEEE Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction With the rapid development of
    communication applications, communication technologies are undergoing revolutionary
    changes generation after generation. Up till now, the development of cellular
    mobile communication systems has undergone five generations. From the first generation
    (1G) analog communication systems to fifth generation (5G) digital communication
    systems, each generation incorporates higher frequencies, larger bandwidths, and
    higher data rates. Starting from 2019, 5G has been officially commercialized,
    employing sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, with a peak rate of 20
    Gbps. From the architecture’s perspective, mobile communication systems have been
    evolving towards more antennas, more advanced multiple access technologies, and
    richer services, as shown in Fig. 1. The 5G base stations exploit massive multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) [1], mmWave, and ultra-dense networking (UDN) technologies
    [2], supporting up to 64 transceiver chains with more antenna elements. Currently,
    commercial 5G base station products using 128 antennas are mature, and HUAWEI
    is the first to release a massive MIMO base station with 384 antennas [3]. In
    addition, 5G can support augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and Internet
    of Everything (IoE). Fig. 1. 1G-5G: Antennas, multiple access technologies, and

    Comments Skip Abstract Section Abstract Animals play a profoundly important and
    intricate role in our lives today. Dogs have been human companions for thousands
    of years, but now they work to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and
    rescue situations. Farm animals are a critical part of sustainable agriculture
    today, and there is increasing consumer interest in humanely raised livestock,
    and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint. Wild animals are threatened
    with extinction by human induced factors, and shrinking and compromised habitats.
    There are many reasons, including societal and economic ones, to explore how new
    computing technologies can be used to ensure the welfare of animals in these settings.
    The goal of this review is to systematically survey the existing literature in
    smart computing and sensing technologies for domestic, farm, and wild animal welfare.
    We use a broad notion of animal welfare to refer to an assessment of whether animals
    are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and positively stimulated in their environment.
    Smart computing and sensing is also used in broad terms, to refer to systems that
    are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of
    remote data collection, processing, exchange, and analysis. The findings of this
    review are expected to motivate future research in computer science and engineering,
    as well as contribute to data, information, and communication management for animal
    welfare. References Joelle Alcaidinho. 2016. Canine behavior and working dog suitability

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    Abstract Plant disease detection attracts significant attention in the field of
    agriculture where image based disease detection plays an important role. To improve
    the yield of plants, it is necessary to detect the onset of diseases in plants
    and advice the farmers to act based on the suggestions. In this paper, a novel
    web enabled disease detection system (WEDDS) based on compressed sensing (CS)
    is proposed to detect and classify the diseases in leaves. Statistical based thresholding
    strategy is proposed for segmentation of the diseased leaf. CS measurements of
    the segmented leaf are uploaded to the cloud to reduce the storage complexity.
    At the monitoring site, the measurements are retrieved and the features are extracted
    from the reconstructed segmented image. The analysis and classification is done
    using support vector machine classifier. The performance of the proposed WEDDS
    has been evaluated in terms of accuracy and is compared with the existing techniques.
    The WEDDS was also evaluated experimentally using Raspberry pi 3 board. The results
    show that the proposed method provides an overall detection accuracy of 98.5%
    and classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similar content being viewed by others Plant

    consist of camera capable sensor nodes and regular sensor nodes deployed in the
    field of interest to gather information and communicate them through wireless
    links [1]. These sensor nodes are small in size and have limited memory, energy
    and bandwidth. WMSN are widely used in applications like agriculture, environmental
    monitoring, healthcare, industrial and home automation, video surveillance, and
    so on. Agriculture is a boon to the tropical countries like India. However, due
    to adverse change in the climatic conditions the productivity and sustainability
    of the farming systems are under high risk. In agriculture applications, pests
    and diseases cause great economic loss to farmers through reduced yields and increased
    costs of pesticides and other control measures. Plant disease detection by visual
    way is a difficult task, and it is less accurate hence automation techniques are
    developed to ease the task and provide high accuracy. The WMSN and image processing
    techniques along with the development of Internet of Technology (IoT) has been
    used to increase the cultivation yield by building a decision support system which
    can detect and classify the disease. The camera nodes placed in the farm captures
    the image of the plants and processes it to detect and segment the disease. The
    segmented image can be transmitted to the monitoring site using internet from
    which the features are extracted for further analysis. The expert at the monitoring
    site classifies the disease based on the features received and provides solutions
    to the farmers. Precise knowledge of areas where disease has spread would help
    the farmer to apply appropriate amounts of pesticides to the affected areas, thereby
    yielding both economic and environmental benefits. In vision based disease detection
    system, segmentation plays a vital role. For extracting the features, the image
    must be segmented efficiently. Image segmentation is a process of grouping or
    separating an image into different parts [2]. There are different types of segmentation
    methods from simple thresholding methods to color based segmentation methods.
    Features are extracted based on color, texture, area and cluster. Feature extraction
    plays a major role in classification. These features are transmitted through the
    sensor nodes to the gateway which is further transmitted to the monitoring site
    through internet. The automation system available at the monitoring site makes
    use of the classifiers and neural networks to classify the disease after which
    the farmers are alerted. Artificial neural networks and support vector machines
    (SVM) are commonly used in the classification process [2]. In this work, a novel
    web enabled disease detection system (WEDDS) is proposed to detect the diseases
    in leaves and segment the diseased part for classification. The main contribution
    of the paper is a simple and efficient segmentation process along with compressed
    sensing (CS). CS states that the signal can be reconstructed with very few measurements
    using a non linear recovery process [3, 4]. With the help of CS, the amount of
    data to be uploaded to the cloud could be reduced efficiently. At the monitoring
    site the features are extracted from the reconstructed segmented image and SVM
    classifier is used to classify the disease. The performance of the proposed approach
    is evaluated in terms of accuracy and compression rate. The proposed work is also
    compared with the well-known K-means clustering based disease detection system.
    The proposed system is implemented in real time using Raspberry Pi 3 board as
    the source node. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
    the related works. Section 3 explains in detail about the proposed work. Section
    4 discusses the simulation results and experimental validation in detail. Finally,
    Sect. 5 gives the conclusion and scope for future work. 2 Literature Survey Few
    IoT based plant disease detection systems available in the literature are discussed
    in this section. The advantages and the limitations of those techniques are also
    provided. Sethi et al. [5] have provided a comprehensive survey on major technologies
    from sensors to applications for Internet of Things. The have discussed different
    aspects of IoT like communication technologies, design considerations, challenges
    along with the development tools for IoT. They have also discussed in detail about
    different application scenarios giving a special importance to differently abled
    and elderly. Mat et al. [6] have developed an IoT and WMSN based system for greenhouse
    environment. They have proved the efficiency of feedback control method in greenhouse
    crop irrigation. The authors have tested and compared the feedback based irrigation
    method with schedule based irrigation method. In Schedule based irrigation method
    the plants were watered at specific time intervals and in feedback based irrigation
    method the plants were watered when the moisture level reached predefined threshold.
    From the results it is observed that the average savings of water is 1500 ml per
    day per tree. It was also observed that the proposed method will optimize the
    usage of water and fertilizer and also keep the wetness or moisture level of the
    crop to be about at the same level as advised by agronomist. Rad et al. [7] proposed
    a precision agricultural management integrated system architecture for monitoring
    vegetation condition of potato crop. The system was developed based on CPS architecture
    and design technologies. The proposed system will help farmers to follow certain
    parameters of interest and make appropriate decisions to increase agricultural
    productivity. To implement such a system, the knowledge of the potato crop is
    required along with management strategies, processing and visualization of information
    technologies. Jones et al. [8] addressed the problem of scheduling pesticide applications
    for commercially grown blueberries. Demand for production of blueberries has grown
    worldwide over the past decade. Georgia, the U.S. state in which all authors reside,
    produces 44.5 million kilograms of blueberries per year, more than any other state
    in the U.S. Since chemical substances used in pesticides may cause adverse effects
    in non-target species, their use is heavily regulated by the Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) in the United States under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
    Rodenticide Act. In order to prevent dangerous substance interactions, some pesticides
    may not be applied. The authors have addressed this problem using tools from formal
    methods and optimal control theory, namely switch time optimization. Their case
    study demonstrates a reduction in expected risk and peak risk when their methodology
    is used. Cimino et al. [9] proposed a low cost embedded architecture for agricultural
    applications. A component-based cyber physical system for agriculture was presented
    based on Arduino and Raspberry platforms. A simple prototype of the proposed system
    has been successfully tested through the exchange of instruction between the various
    units. Results have confirmed feasibility of the approach both in terms of performance
    and of costs. A major feature consists of the modularity and extensibility of
    the architecture. Later on, they enhanced the system by adding capabilities to
    the central processing unit. Dong et al. [10] presented a proof-of-concept for
    a CPS application called Wireless Underground Sensor-Aided Center Pivot (WUSA-CP)
    irrigation system. This system provides autonomous irrigation management capabilities
    by monitoring the soil conditions in real time using wireless underground sensors.
    Two WSN for agriculture were developed in Washington State, one has been designed
    for regional-scale applications, such as weather networks, and the other designed
    for on-farm applications, such as temperature monitoring for frost protection.
    Both WSN strategies were successfully implemented in the intended applications
    of AgWeatherNet and AgFrost-Net, respectively [11]. Vijay and Mishra [12] have
    proposed a novel image segmentation algorithm for automatic detection and classification
    of plant leaf diseases. Image segmentation was done using the genetic algorithm,
    and SVM classifier was used for classification. The accuracy of the proposed system
    was found to be 95.71% and classification accuracy was found to be 97.6%. In [13],
    Dandawate et al. developed an automated decision support system which made use
    of scale invariant feature transform to detect the disease based on the leaf shape,
    and SVM was used to classify the disease. This system helps the farmers with minimal
    effort. Dhakate et al. [14] proposed a methodology which makes use of image processing
    and neural networks to detect and classify the diseases in pomegranate plant.
    The diseases considered for demonstration are Fruit Spot, Bacterial Blight, and
    Leaf Spot. The proposed approach gave satisfactory results with 90% accuracy.
    A web based disease detection technique for Bacterial Blight in Pomegranate fruit
    was proposed by Bhange et al. [15]. This system helped the farmers to make decisions
    for a better yield, and the system had an overall accuracy of 82%. Mokhtar et
    al. [16] proposed a SVM based tomato disease detection system which used image
    cropping and image filtering techniques to improve the quality of the leaves.
    The accuracy achieved by the proposed system was 78%. It is observed that SVM
    achieves better accuracy in classification process. Hence, it is adopted in this
    work. From the detailed survey, it is observed that the automatic detection and
    analysis of diseases is necessary to provide solutions to farmers at the right
    time. Hence, it is important to develop an IOT based system to detect the plant
    diseases with which the experts can provide effective solutions. 3 Proposed Work
    An efficient and novel web enabled disease detection system (WEDDS) is proposed
    to segment and classify the leaf diseases. WEDDS will upload the captured and
    segmented image from the sensor platform to the cloud platform in an efficient
    manner. This system is beneficial as it reduces manual monitoring in big farms
    and can detect the diseases at very early stage when they appear on plant leaves.
    Figure 1 shows the overview of the IOT based plant disease detection system. The
    cameras deployed in the agricultural field is used to capture the leaves periodically
    or whenever the change in color of the leaf is detected. The segmentation process
    is carried out on the captured leaves to segment the affected area. The segmented
    image is uploaded to the cloud for further classification. To reduce the amount
    of data to be stored in the cloud, the concept of compressed sensing is used.
    CS is applied to the segmented image to reduce the amount of data to be uploaded
    to the cloud. Very few measurements are uploaded rather than all samples of the
    segmented image. At the monitoring site, the measurements are retrieved from the
    cloud from which the segmented image is reconstructed using CS recovery algorithm.
    The experts at the monitoring site extract the features and classify the disease
    with the help of SVM algorithm and provide solution to the farmers. Fig. 1 Proposed
    web enabled disease detection system for agricultural applications using WMSN
    Full size image The proposed IOT based system consists of six phases: image acquisition,
    image preprocessing, image segmentation, compressed sensing, feature extraction,
    analysis, and classification, where the first four phases are carried out at the
    sensor end, and the rest at the monitoring site. 3.1 Image Acquisition The camera
    capable sensor nodes capture the images of the leaves and process them to segment
    the diseased part. The camera is triggered only when the color change on leaf
    is detected thereby reducing the memory and energy consumption. In some cases,
    the images are captured periodically. The image is preprocessed before the segmentation
    process to enhance the quality of the image. 3.2 Image Pre-processing In the pre-processing
    phase, initially the contrast of the image is enhanced. The RGB to L*a*b* transformation
    is carried out on the enhanced image as it can be easily segmented from the L*a*b*
    transformed image rather than the RGB image. A threshold strategy is implemented
    to segment the diseased part from the leaf. 3.3 Image Segmentation In the segmentation
    phase, the WEDDS system makes use of a thresholding strategy to segment the diseased
    part of the leaves. Mean based thresholding strategy (MTS) is designed using the
    L*a*b* transformed image and the pixels of the transformed image are compared
    with the threshold to segment the affected part. The procedure for designing the
    MTS is similar to the work reported in [17] which is shown in Fig. 2. Here the
    mean is computed using the L* image instead of H image as in [17] for enhanced
    segmentation. Fig. 2 Design of threshold Full size image The pixels of the L*
    image are compared with the threshold shown in Eq. (1) to segment the diseased
    part of the leaves. The segmented image then undergoes the process of CS to reduce
    the segmented image to few measurements and then the measurements are transmitted
    to the cloud through wireless medium. 3.4 Compressed Sensing CS is applied to
    extract the measurements from the segmented image. The segmented image is transformed
    to sparse image using the discrete cosine transform as the CS theory can only
    be applied to sparse signals. The measurements are extracted from the segmented
    image using the hybrid measurement matrix [18]. In this work, block based CS approach
    is adopted to reduce the computational complexity of the CS process. The blocks
    corresponding to the disease affected area undergoes the CS process as given in
    Eqs. (2) and (3) to extract and transmit the measurements to the cloud. $$\text{s}_{\text{t}}
    = {\uppsi r}_{{\text{st}}}$$ (2) $$\text{y}_{{\text{st}}} = {\Phi s}_{\text{t}}$$
    (3) where \(\text{r}_{{\text{st}}}\) represents the sparse vector of the segmented
    blocks, t = 0,1,…,T represents the blocks, \(\uppsi\) represents the basis matrix,
    \(\text{y}_{{\text{st}}}\) represents the measurement vector of the segmented
    block and \(\Phi\) represents the hybrid measurement matrix [5]. Once the measurements
    are obtained, it is uploaded to the cloud. 3.5 Feature Extraction The measurements
    are retrieved from the cloud and the segmented image is reconstructed using the
    existing and well known orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. OMP is a
    simple and easily implementable algorithm which estimates the sparse signal through
    the iteration process [19]. Inverse DCT is applied to obtain the segmented image.
    Feature extraction is carried out based on the texture analysis. The gray level
    co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used to obtain the statistical texture features
    [12]. Contrast, energy, homogeneity, entropy and correlation are some of the texture
    based features extracted from the segmented image given in Eqs. (4)–(8). The GLCM
    matrix is used for the L* image and the features and its corresponding equations
    are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Texture features extracted from the segmented image
    [12] Full size table where P(i, j) denotes the elements of the GLCM matrix, and
    K denotes the number of gray levels in the image. 3.6 Classification and Analysis
    of Disease The extracted features are given as input to the classification algorithm.
    SVM is commonly used in the classification process and belongs to the group of
    supervised learning [12, 15]. Supervised learning makes use of the training dataset
    to predict the testing dataset. SVM yields high accuracy when used with texture
    features. SVM makes use of the linear kernel function to classify the healthy
    leaves and diseased leaves. After classification, the reports are analysed by
    the experts, and the information is sent to the farmers. The detected disease
    along with the solution is sent to the farmers for appropriate action to improve
    cultivation yield. 4 Performance Evaluation The proposed WEDDS system has been
    validated using simulation and experimental analysis. Database has been created
    with 20 images for training and 10 images for testing. Three plant leaves such
    as pomegranate leaves, brinjal leaves and tomato leaves are considered for testing.
    The diseases considered for demonstration are Anthracnose and Alternaria Alternata
    in the pomegranate leaves, Phytophthora blight and Alternaria leaf spot in the
    brinjal leaves, Early blight and Septoria leaf spot in tomato leaves [20, 21].
    The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of compression rate,
    detection accuracy and classification accuracy of the system. 4.1 Simulation Results
    and Analysis The proposed disease detection and classification system is simulated
    using MATLAB environment in Windows 10 PC. In the image acquisition phase, the
    test images are taken as input and pre-processed by resizing the image to 256
    × 256. To enhance the quality of the image, contrast enhancement technique is
    adopted. After enhancing the quality, the image is transformed from RGB to HSI
    color space. The image is segmented using the proposed MTS threshold strategy.
    The threshold is computed using Eq. (1) and the pixels of the L* image are compared
    with the threshold to segment the diseased part in the leaves. After segmentation,
    CS process is applied only to those corresponding blocks to obtain the measurements
    with the help of hybrid measurement matrix. The percentage of reduction in data
    after applying CS is calculated using (9) $$P_{s} = \left( {1 - \frac{P}{Q}} \right)*100\,\%$$
    (9) where \(P\) represents the number of measurements per image and \(Q\) represents
    the number of samples per image. Table 2 shows the analysis of percentage of reduction
    in amount of data to be transmitted for different plant leaf diseases. Table 2
    Analysis of percentage of reduction in samples for different leaf diseases Full
    size table From Table 2 it is observed that percentage of reduction in data is
    proportional to the number of the blocks corresponding to the segmented image.
    The number of measurements required for reconstruction is fixed at 40 per block
    of size 8 × 8 which shows around 68% reduction in the amount of data to be transmitted
    compared to all samples in the segmented image. Further, these measurements are
    transmitted to the cloud, and the segmented image is reconstructed using OMP algorithm.
    The texture based features such as contrast, energy, homogeneity, entropy and
    correlation are computed using Eqs. (4–8) for the segmented image. GLCM matrix
    for L* image is used to analyze the texture based features. These features are
    used for classification of the plant disease. SVM classifier is used at the receiver
    side in a PC which has the database with trained images for classification. After
    reconstruction, SVM is used to classify the disease, and the accuracy of the system
    is evaluated in MATLAB. Figures 3 and 4 show the input test images, preprocessed
    images, segmented images and reconstructed images from CS measurements of the
    diseased pomegranate leaves. Figures 5 and 6 show the input test images, preprocessed
    images, segmented images and reconstructed images from CS measurements of the
    diseased brinjal leaves. Figures 7 and 8 show the input test images, preprocessed
    images, segmented images and reconstructed images from CS measurements of the
    diseased tomato leaves. The performance of the proposed work is evaluated in terms
    of accuracy of the system which is compared with the existing work reported in
    [12, 15]. Fig. 3 Segmentation and classification in pomegranate leaves: a Anthracnose

    the total number of test images. The accuracy of the system is tabulated for different
    diseases in Table 3. The proposed MTS is compared with the well-known K-means
    clustering process based segmentation. Table 3 Comparison of the proposed work

    system achieves 98.5% accuracy on an average, and it is better compared with the
    work reported in [12], SVM with K-means clustering process [15] and SVM with CS
    based K-means clustering process. Figure 9 shows the overall accuracy achieved
    using the proposed WEDDS with SVM classifier for different plant leaves. The five
    different classes of leaf diseases are considered for classification, and the
    classification accuracy for individual cases are tabulated in Table 4. The classification
    accuracy determines the rate of correct classification of the specific diseases
    from the test images. Fig. 9 Comparison of overall accuracy of the proposed system

    Experimental Analysis The experimental evaluation is carried out in Raspberry
    Pi 3 Model B [22] shown in Fig. 10 which is operated under Raspbian Jessie software
    [23]. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is a Single-board computer which features a quad-core
    64-bit ARM Cortex A53 clocked at 1.2 GHz. It has 1 GB RAM with wireless LAN and
    Bluetooth connectivity [22]. It has 40 GPIO pins to connect external sensors and
    four USB ports to which keyboard and mouse can be connected. The operating system
    is booted from the SD card. Fig. 10 Raspberry Pi 3 Model B [20] Full size image
    The USB camera can also be connected to the RPi board to capture the images in
    real time, but for implementation purpose the database images are stored in the
    board. The experimental setup and results are shown in Fig. 11. OpenCV [24] an
    open source library for computer vision applications is used for reading the input
    image. Fig. 11 Experimental validation Full size image The disease detection and
    segmentation algorithm is implemented in RPi board using Python language. The
    CS algorithm has also been implemented to obtain the segmented measurements. The
    CS measurements are uploaded to the cloud from RPi board using the inbuilt Wi-Fi.
    Thingspeak is one of the IOT platforms that is used to collect the data privately
    from the sensor, analyze data with MATLAB and trigger the action [25]. Thingspeak
    has both private and public channels to upload the data and each channel is assigned
    with an ID [25]. Initially the data can be uploaded in the private channels and
    can be made public for users to access. Each channel has eight fields, and each
    measurement can be uploaded in each field which is shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 12 Thingspeak
    channel for uploading the data Full size image To upload forty measurements per
    block, five channels are used. These channels can be made public or can be shared
    with authorized person who can view, retrieve and analyze the data. The data can
    be uploaded using write API keys that are generated for each channel. The CS measurements
    are retrieved at the monitoring site, and classification is done using SVM classifier
    in MATLAB as shown in Fig. 13. The experts provide solutions to the farmers based
    on the classification results. Fig. 13 Classification results at the monitoring
    site Full size image 5 Conclusion and Scope for Future Work Plant disease detection
    is one of the important for agricultural applications to increase the yield. In
    the current study, WMSN with camera capability has been used to capture the diseased
    leaves in the farm and process it to extract the features. These features extracted
    from the segmented image are used for classification purpose based on which the
    farmers are given suggestions. An efficient system based on IOT and CS is proposed
    for automatic detection and classification of the plant leaf diseases. The segmentation
    process is carried out by designing an efficient threshold based on statistical
    measures, and the segmented image undergoes CS process before transmitting it
    in the wireless medium. The CS measurements are transmitted to the cloud and retrieved
    at the monitoring site. The features are extracted using GLCM matrix from the
    reconstructed image and SVM classifier is used to classify the disease using linear
    kernel function. The proposed WEDDS is simulated using MATLAB, and from the results
    obtained, it is observed that the proposed system shows an overall detection accuracy
    of around 98.5% and classification accuracy of around 98.4%. The proposed system
    performs better compared to existing disease detection systems available in the
    literature. The proposed system is also experimentally tested using Raspberry
    Pi 3 as the sensor platform, and the CS measurements are transmitted to the Thingspeak
    IOT platform in real time. Experiment is implemented using the python language
    and eight Thingspeak channels are used for uploading the measurements in the cloud.
    In future, the proposed system would be deployed and tested in real field. The
    camera will be used to capture different regions in a farm from which the leaves
    of the plants will be separated to segment the diseased area. History about the
    entire region with the specific crop based details can be collected and maintained
    for further reference. User friendly app could be developed to alert the farmers
    and provide them with solutions in real time. References Lee, I., Shaw, W., &

    of (mobile) multi-hop ad hoc networking with the aim to present the current status
    of the research activities and identify the consolidated research areas, with
    limited research opportunities, and the hot and emerging research areas for which
    further research is required. We start by briefly discussing the MANET paradigm,
    and why the research on MANET protocols is now a cold research topic. Then we
    analyze the active research areas. Specifically, after discussing the wireless-network
    technologies, we analyze four successful ad hoc networking paradigms, mesh networks,
    opportunistic networks, vehicular networks, and sensor networks that emerged from
    the MANET world. We also present an emerging research direction in the multi-hop
    ad hoc networking field: people centric networking, triggered by the increasing
    penetration of the smartphones in everyday life, which is generating a people-centric
    revolution in computing and communications. Previous article in issue Next article

    networks 1. Introduction This article discusses the state of the art of (mobile)
    multi-hop ad hoc networking [1]. The aim is (i) to point out research topics that
    have been extensively researched and are now cold research areas, for which further
    research is not recommended, and (ii) to identify the hot and emerging research
    challenges that still require extensive investigations. The multi-hop (mobile)
    ad hoc networking paradigm emerged, in the civilian field, around 90′s with the
    availability of off-the-shelf wireless technologies able to provide direct network
    connections among users devices: Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), for Wireless Personal
    Area Network (WPAN), and the IEEE 802.11 standards’ family for high-speed Wireless
    LAN (WLAN), see Chapters 2–4 in [2]. Specifically, these wireless standards allow
    direct communications among network devices within the transmission range of their
    wireless interfaces thus making single-hop ad hoc network a reality, i.e., infrastructure-less
    WLAN/WPAN where devices communicate without the need of any network infrastructure.
    The multi-hop paradigm was then conceived to extend the possibility to communicate
    to any couple of network nodes, without the need to develop any ubiquitous network
    infrastructure: nearby users directly communicate (by exploiting the wireless-network
    interfaces of their devices in ad hoc mode) not only to exchange their own data
    but also to relay the traffic of other network nodes that cannot directly communicate,
    thus operating as the routers do in the legacy Internet [3]. This paradigm has
    been often identified with the solutions developed inside the MANET IETF working
    group, and for this reason was often called the MANET paradigm [4]. At its birth,
    MANET was seen as one of the most innovative and challenging wireless networking
    paradigm and was promising to become one of the major technologies, increasingly
    present in everyday life of everybody. Therefore, MANET immediately gained momentum
    and this produced tremendous research efforts in the mobile-network community
    [5]. MANET research focused on what we call pure general-purpose MANET, where
    pure indicates that no infrastructure is assumed to implement the network functions
    and no authority is in charge of managing and controlling the network. General-purpose
    denotes that these networks are not designed with any specific application in
    mind, but rather to support any legacy TCP/IP application. Following this view,
    the researchers focused on enhancing and extending the IP-layer routing and forwarding
    functionalities in order to support the legacy Internet services in a network
    without any infrastructure. At network layer, we observed a proliferation of routing
    protocol proposals, as legacy Internet routing protocols developed for wired networks
    are clearly not suitable for the unpredictable and dynamic nature of MANET topology.
    The research interests rapidly spread from routing to all layers of the Internet
    protocol stack, from the physical up to the application layer [6], however applications,
    probably constitutes the less investigated area of MANETs. Indeed, in the design
    of general-purpose MANETs, there was not a clear understanding of the applications
    for which multi-hop ad hoc networks are an opportunity. Lack of attention to the
    applications, probably, represents one of the major causes for the negligible
    MANET impact in the wireless networking field. After about two decades of intense
    research efforts, the MANET research field produced profound theoretical results
    (e.g., performance bounds on MANET performance [6], [7]), or innovative protocols
    and architectural solutions (e.g., cross-layer architectures and protocols) [5],
    but in terms of real world implementations and industrial deployments, the pure
    general-purpose MANET paradigm suffers from scarce exploitation and low interest
    in the industry and among the users [4]. Therefore, in the last years, the interest
    for the MANET paradigm has been rapidly decreasing and the research on MANET protocols
    can now be considered a cold research topic. Indeed, it is interesting to observe
    that the number of manuscripts focusing on MANET, published in top quality journals,
    is rapidly decreasing.1 Even though MANET research has not a major impact on the
    wireless networking field (except for specialized fields such as military and
    disaster recovery), several networking paradigms have emerged from the MANET field
    that are currently generating interest both in the academia and industry. Among
    these, let''s remember: mesh networks, vehicular networks, opportunistic networks
    and sensor networks. These multi-hop ad hoc networking paradigms, by learning
    from the MANET experience, emerged from MANET by avoiding the main weaknesses
    of the MANET research by following a more pragmatic development strategy [4].
    In this article, after a review of the current status of wireless technologies
    for multi-hop networks (see Section 2), we discuss the open research challenges
    in mobile ad hoc networking paradigms: mesh networks (see Section 3), opportunistic
    networking (see Section 4), vehicular networks (see Section 5) and sensor networks
    (see Section 6). Section 7 is devoted to the emerging people-centric paradigm
    that, thanks to the increasing diffusion of the smartphones, combines wireless
    communications and sensor networks to build computing and communication solutions
    that are tightly coupled with the daily life and behaviors of people. 2. Technologies
    for mobile multi-hop wireless networks, 2 Many technologies and standards, enabling
    multi-hop wireless networking, as well as off-the-shelf equipment implementing
    such technologies, are available today [8]. Nevertheless, we can easily foresee
    that research interest in these topics will not diminish in the next years, but
    rather it is likely to grow. There are at least two reasons for this. On the one
    hand, the development and availability of technologies and equipment is driven
    by standardization and regulation activities. Networking standards, thus including
    multi-hop wireless ones, are primarily concerned with ensuring device interoperability,
    a key requirement to allow for networking equipment mass production and market
    diversification. Nevertheless, guaranteeing interoperability does not require
    a full system specification; rather, standards usually do not specify key aspects
    that do not affect interoperability to create additional space for competition
    among manufacturers. One such example is the resource allocation/scheduling on
    the data plane, whose implementation strongly affects performance but does not
    concern interoperability. Therefore, new technologies and standards, even though
    leaning upon a layer of fundamental research results, always call for investigating
    many practical aspects that are mainly related to system customization and performance
    optimization in concrete scenarios. In the following sections, we will highlight
    the challenges that we envision for a set of relevant technologies and standards
    related to wireless multi-hop networks. On the other hand, one key advantage of
    mobile multi-hop/mesh wireless communication technologies is that they allow for
    easy and fast, highly scalable and cost-effective network deployment under heterogeneous
    environments. Therefore, there are many heterogeneous application scenarios where
    multi-hop wireless technologies represent one of the most effective solutions,
    if not the only viable one. Many of such scenarios are real today, like public
    city-wide dedicated services (e.g., video-surveillance or transport systems),
    Internet access in rural areas, environmental monitoring through sensing systems,
    disaster emergencies, etc. As observed in [4], a pragmatic development approach
    allowed a bunch of research activities to thrive focusing on the specific challenges
    and requirements of these different scenarios in order to build robust and effective
    networking solutions (either mesh, sensor, opportunistic, or vehicular). We think
    however that new application and deployment scenarios, for which multi-hop wireless
    networks can play a crucial role, will just grow exponentially in the near future,
    as the Internet of Things vision will become a reality [9]. Connecting everything,
    anytime and everywhere will demand for capillary and pervasive network coverage,
    for which multi-hop wireless technologies represent an effective solution. However,
    such scenarios will pose many new challenges – one on top of all others: scalability
    – which will entail reconsidering current results and will likely boost a new
    wave of research on multi-hop wireless technologies. Let us briefly review some
    of them in the following. Smart cities. This term identifies a generic scenario
    where Information and Communication Technologies are employed to sustain the development
    of urban environments. This is achieved by the pervasive deployment of sensing,
    computation, and communication infrastructures in order to collect and distribute
    the information needed to develop and improve new services offered to citizens
    by municipalities. As such, this scenario is indeed comprehensive of many heterogeneous
    ones. In most cases, the communication infrastructure is characterized by frequent
    topology changes, faults in equipment, and/or harsh environmental conditions,
    which naturally call for the use of multi-hop wireless network technologies. All
    scenarios, however, share some common and unique features, e.g., very dense networks
    comprising thousands of devices, and uncommon traffic patterns made of a very
    large number of low data-rate flows. As highlighted in [10], this needs reconsidering
    traditional network design and technologies, and open new challenges in terms
    of standardization (including multi-hop communication), cooperation (e.g., managing
    interference in dense environments), security, QoS [11], etc. Research activities
    addressing these new challenges are already ongoing, and more are expected to
    come, as the Smart City scenario will evolve in the future. Industrial Internet.
    Communication networks are a key component of infrastructures supporting complex
    industrial processes. Being involved in the control process, they have very critical
    requirements in terms of reliability and QoS [12]. To meet such requirements,
    industrial networks typically use wired connections, and dedicated standards have
    been developed. On the other hand, the need to reduce costs is triggering a new
    trend towards IP-based solutions that leverage multi-hop wireless technologies
    allowing for cost-effective industrial network deployments [13]. However, providing
    ultra-high reliability and deterministic QoS guarantees in multi-hop wireless
    networks is a challenging task, combined with the need of implementing low-power
    consumption solutions. Though already investigated in the past, these issues are
    still open and require new research work specifically focusing on the Industrial
    Internet scenario. Machine-to-Machine applications (M2M). Though partially overlapping
    with other scenarios, this one is characterized by the deployment of communication
    technologies aiming to interconnect devices (machines) involved in control and
    monitoring applications that do not require humans in the loop. The reason for
    having many of these applications is to remove human intervention for improved
    efficiency, security, and safety. As such, industrial applications are an instance
    of M2M applications, but they are not the only scenario of interest. In fact,
    when referring to M2M communications, ubiquitous connectivity is usually considered
    a mandatory requirement, which is not usually the case for industrial deployments.
    Therefore, mobile broadband wireless network technologies are mainly in the spotlight
    [14]. Requirements are QoS provisioning, energy-efficiency and co-existence with
    other communication types, e.g., Human-to-Human (H2H), under specific traffic
    patterns [15] and very large density of devices. This is challenging to achieve
    in mobile cellular networks, and needs considering novel approaches such as Heterogeneous
    Networks (HetNets for short) [16] and Device-to-Device (D2D) communication [17].
    In both cases, multi-hop relaying provides benefits that will be illustrated in
    more detail in the next sections. Smart grid. It is today commonly recognized
    that upgrading current power grids operation by integrating advanced sensing,
    communication and control functionalities is mandatory for the purpose of improving
    reliability and safety, increasing efficiency by cost reduction and reducing CO2
    emissions [18]. This requires the design and deployment of an integrated communication
    network including different segments in terms of geographic scale and functionality,
    for which therefore different communication technologies are applicable. These
    networks are usually referred as Home Area Networks (HANs), covering a single
    residential unit, Neighborhood Area Networks (NANs), including a cluster of homes
    usually powered by the same transformer, and Wide Area Networks (WAN), which connect
    NANs to the utility operator. Moreover, equipment in the field requires to be
    controlled by a separate network called Field Area Network (FAN) having a geographic
    scale similar to NANs. For all these different networks, multi-hop wireless technologies,
    either broadband, local area, or short range, depending on the coverage requirements,
    are an effective solution. However, new Smart Grid specific applications are planned
    to be realized through the Smart Grid network infrastructure, like Advanced Metering,
    Demand Response, Wide Area Situational Awareness, and Distributed Energy resources
    and storage. Based on the data requirements of these applications, new challenges
    have arisen at the network layer of the protocol stack [19]. In particular, these
    applications are expected to have high security, high reliability, and various
    QoS requirements such as bandwidth and latency, which need to be addressed by
    routing and data forwarding in the first place [20], [21], and likely then through
    cross-layer approaches. Energy efficiency is also a key requirement when low-power
    devices are used [22]. For HANs and NANs, the standardization activity carried
    out by the IETF ROLL (Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks) working group
    is also relevant. Personal healthcare. There has been a tremendous development
    and advancement of micro- and nano-technologies that allow building miniaturized
    low-power sensors with (wireless) communication and computation capabilities that
    can be placed on a human body for various medical (e.g. personal health monitoring)
    and even non-medical (e.g., personal entertainment) applications [23]. When connected
    together, they form a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), which aim to provide
    fast and reliable communication among sensors/actuators within and on the human
    body, and with the outside networks in proximity. The above scenarios are certainly
    not the only relevant ones for wireless multi-hop technologies. In Smart Homes,
    for example, wireless multi-hop communication is involved both in wireless LAN
    technologies delivering high-definition multimedia streams to multiple terminals
    and in wireless sensor and actuator networks for home automation. On the other
    hand, Intelligent Transportation Systems require networking infrastructures for
    vehicle to roadside communications that involve wireless multi-hop communications,
    like, e.g., in wireless mesh networks supporting node mobility and efficient handoffs.
    Future research activities on multi-hop wireless networks will have to face the
    many challenges described above depending on the specific scenario considered.
    Besides those challenges, however, it is of paramount importance that performance
    evaluation results will be credible enough to provide real insights in the studied
    technologies. To this aim, it is an integral part of research efforts to produce
    realistic simulation models for such diverse scenarios, and to develop real testbeds
    to evaluate experimentally, with the help of users, the technologies under consideration.
    Without claiming to be comprehensive, in the following sections we delve into
    some of the current and envisioned technologies and standards mentioned above
    in order to provide more details on specific requirements and identify the most
    important challenges that need to be addressed. For the ease of reading, they
    are grouped into three classes depending on their typical coverage: mobile broadband
    access and cellular networks, local area networks, and, finally, low-power and
    short range networks. 2.1. Mobile broadband wireless access Multi-hop communications
    Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks have been historically neglected since
    central coordination makes multi-hop an inherent complex task. However, the very
    challenging requirements of ITU IMT-Advanced systems finally required to deal
    with such complexity in order to gain in terms of spectral and energy efficiency.
    Relay support was first introduced in IEEE 802.16m (Mobile WiMAX) [24] and LTE-Advanced
    (Rel. 10). Although WiMAX was developed before LTE as a 4G technology, interest
    on it has rapidly declined as the carrier market has definitely opted for the
    latter. In the following, we therefore focus on LTE/LTE-A and specific research
    challenges related to multi-hop communication. Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets)
    refer to the heterogeneous deployment of low-power nodes within an LTE/LTE-A macrocell
    with the aim of boosting overall spectral and energy efficiency by means of enhanced
    spatial resource reuse [25], [26]. One such node may serve a small cell underlying
    the macrocell network (e.g., a picocell or femtocell) or act as a Relay Node (RN)
    between User Equipments (UEs) and the serving evolved NodeB (eNodeB, known as
    the donor eNB, or DeNB). In the latter case, the backhaul link is wireless, thus
    forming a multi-hop wireless network. RN deployment in HetNets have benefits in
    terms of improved cell edge performance and load balancing (typically, by deploying
    relays at the edge of the macrocell), reduced power consumption, and increased
    capacity. However, it also brings several challenges to radio resource management
    in terms of interference mitigation, radio resource utilization, QoS and implementation
    complexity. A comprehensive survey of state-of-art radio resource management schemes
    for LTE/LTE-A multi-hop networks, and related open research challenges, can be
    found in [27]. Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a network paradigm that
    allows direct communication between devices in an infrastructure-based wireless
    network without the involvement of a central access point/base station. While
    largely exploited in wireless local and personal area networks, D2D communication
    has been considered recently also for cellular network technologies as a further
    means to improve spectral efficiency [17]. In a cellular network, D2D is mainly
    intended for single hop communication between UEs, and it is centrally coordinated
    by a supervising entity (e.g., eNB), which is finally responsible for radio resource
    management. However, D2D communication also enables multi-hop relay of data, i.e.,
    a UE may act as a relay between another UE and the base station, thus enlarging
    cellular coverage and potentially improving the performance of cell edge users,
    without incurring the cost of deploying conventional relay nodes as with HetNets
    [28], [29]. D2D communication may also provide an efficient solution for M2M communications
    in cellular networks [30], whereby the UE is used to relay M2M data from multiple
    machines to the base station. This allows a cell to better scale with the high
    control overhead and possible congestion due to the very large number of low data
    rate flows of a typical M2M communication system. Research challenges for D2D
    communication focus on different aspects depending on how the cellular spectrum
    is allocated to D2D links. With underlay inband D2D the spectrum is shared, therefore
    interference mitigation is of utmost importance. On the other hand, with overlay
    inband D2D dedicated resources are allocated to D2D links though the spectrum
    is still shared with cellular links: optimizing radio resource allocation is more
    relevant in this case. Finally, with outband D2D architectural issues due to the
    use of multiple radio interfaces and heterogeneous wireless technologies need
    to be faced [31]. When D2D communication is used for multi-hop relay, a key challenge
    is how to properly select a relay node for optimizing a performance measure of
    interest (e.g., maximize the capacity). The relay being a user device, it is also
    of interest to investigate mechanisms for motivating users to allow data relaying
    through their own UEs, considering that this implies increased battery draining
    as well as reduced available capacity. D2D communication is currently considered
    by 3GPP for standardization; however, it is limited to the use case of Proximity
    Services in Public Safety scenarios, where multi-hop data relaying is also relevant
    [32]. 2.2. Local area networks Enabling multi-hop communication in wireless LANs
    has received a lot of interest in both academia and industry since the very early
    days when WLAN technologies and standards were developed. This is mainly because
    WLAN technologies are typically operated in license-free bands and therefore have
    limited coverage by definition; multi-hop communication is hence the only viable
    option to overcome such limitations. Due to its widespread diffusion, the IEEE
    802.11 standard dominates in this area as a key technology enabler for multi-hop
    networks of various kinds, including MANETs and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs)
    [8], [32]. From a standardization point of view, the IEEE 802.11 standard did
    not originally include support to multi-hop transmissions, and it took a long
    time to extend it to provide mesh networking support as a result of the work of
    Task Group “s” inside the 802.11 Working Group. However, the 802.11s amendment
    has failed to meet industry acceptance, and available commercial solutions are
    typically based on proprietary extensions. More recently, the IEEE 802.11ah TG
    has been chartered to meet the typical requirements of IoT scenarios, where thousands
    of devices generating low-data rate flows need to be connected in the same area
    by an energy-efficient protocol (which is not the case of IEEE 802.11) [33]. Multi-hop
    communication is considered by 802.11ah to increase coverage and reduce energy
    consumption: the infrastructure BSS is in fact extended with two-hop relaying,
    which is expected to be much easier to implement than the 802.11s framework. However,
    the definition of the forwarding mechanisms as well as of the modifications needed
    at the MAC layer is still at an early stage. 2.3. Low power/Short range networks
    Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) refer generally to networks consisting of
    a very large number of constrained nodes (i.e., with limited processing power,
    memory, and energy when battery operated) operating over lossy links, that typically
    support only low data rates and are usually unstable. Though LLN links can also
    be wired, LLNs based on wireless mesh networks is the most common case, leveraging
    the IEEE 802.15.4 low-rate WPAN standard. LLNs are the typical instance of capillary
    networks (i.e., edge networks) in a large class of IoT scenarios. To meet the
    challenging IoT requirements in terms of interoperability, diversity of applications,
    and scalability, protocols at different layers have been specified by IETF in
    order to enable IPv6 over LLNs, including the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer and the
    RPL routing protocol [34], [35]. RPL is a distance-vector based protocol allowing
    for multiple instances running concurrently which optimize multi-path forwarding
    to specific destinations according to different objective functions depending
    on link costs and node attributes/status information. This is needed to meet the
    diverse routing requirements from heterogeneous applications running on top of
    the same LLN. Although some basic objective functions are specified by IETF, investigating
    what combination of metrics/constraints and parameter configuration is optimal
    depending on the use case requirements remains an open issue [36]. More recently,
    the IEEE 802.15.4e amendment has introduced a new TDMA-based MAC protocol named
    TSCH (Time-Slotted Channel Hopping), to facilitate the development of LLNs with
    a more deterministic behavior in terms of delay and power consumption, thus allowing
    to meet the high reliability requirements of the Industrial Internet [13]. In
    particular, TSCH allows for the advanced scheduling of transmission patterns in
    different time slots across the whole (wireless mesh) network. However, as expected,
    it does not specify any mandatory algorithm to determine and maintain such schedule,
    depending on the multi-hop network topology and characteristics, and the traffic
    requirements. The use of TSCH is therefore subject to many possible optimizations
    and customizations that are still open issues. The IETF 6TiSCH working group is
    currently working on specifying an architecture to enable IPv6 over TSCH and integrate
    it with 6LoWPAN and RPL. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) leverage the IEEE
    802.15.6 standard for low power, short range and extremely reliable wireless communications
    supporting a large range of data rates within the surrounding area of the human
    body [37]. Research challenges involve all layers of the protocol stack. At the
    PHY layer, channel modeling and antenna design very much depend on the challenging
    environment (the human body) [23]. Meeting power requirements with diverse traffic
    characteristics while providing extremely high reliable throughput and delay is
    of utmost importance in this context and remains an open challenge at the MAC
    layer [38], [39]. In particular, deterministic performance guaranteed by TDMA
    may not be suitable since periodic synchronization requires extra energy consumption,
    and viable alternatives need be investigated [40]. When multi-hop communication
    is adopted, developing suitable routing protocols remains a key challenge, given
    the requirement of maximizing network lifetime and considering that frequent topology
    changes occur due to body movements [23]. Radio frequency (RF) energy transfer
    and harvesting, i.e., the capability of converting the received RF signals into
    electrical energy, is an emerging technology that has recently received a lot
    of attention as an alternative proactive method to power nodes in a wireless network.
    In RF energy harvesting networks, a key challenge is to develop network functionalities
    that are energy-aware in the traditional sense, i.e., power consumption is reduced,
    but also, and most importantly, with the new meaning of using the network also
    for energy transfer and harvesting besides data communication. At the MAC layer,
    this entails coordinating channel access so as to reserve resources (i.e., time)
    for RF energy harvesting. When multi-hop communication is considered, routing
    protocols also need to be specifically designed to ensure a proper energy distribution
    to maintain end-to-end communication [41]. 3. Wireless mesh networks3 The design
    of the Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) paradigm started from a well-defined set of
    application scenarios that can be summarized as in [42]: “providing a flexible
    and low cost extension of the Internet”. Starting from the well-defined application
    scenario, the WMN paradigm introduces an architectural shift, with respect to
    MANET, by adopting a two-tier network architecture based on multi-hop communications.
    A multi-hop wireless backbone is formed by dedicated (and often fixed) wireless
    mesh routers, which run a multi-hop routing strategy to interconnect with each
    other. Furthermore, some mesh routers act as gateways, providing the WMN with
    a direct connection to the Internet and other wired/wireless networks. Finally,
    to support seamless data transport services for users’ devices (also called mesh
    clients), mesh access points are connected to the mesh routers to offer connectivity
    to mesh clients. Consequently, topology changes due to mobility or energy issues
    do not influence traffic forwarding in WMNs as in MANETs, and the impact of the
    mobility is restricted to the last hop, i.e., the connection between the users
    and the mesh access points [42]. According to the two-tier network architecture,
    WMNs research activities have been subdivided in three main areas: (i) Exploiting
    the wireless mesh routers to build a robust network backbone interconnecting the
    mesh routers, and possibly some gateways to/from the Internet; (ii) Defining a
    set of routing protocols which, by exploiting the network backbone can identify
    the best path(s) for traffic forwarding inside the WMN and to/from the Internet;
    (iii) Supporting the users’ mobility among mesh access points; All areas have
    been subject of intense research activities providing effective solutions for
    these problems. In particular, a large body of research focused on building a
    robust wireless mesh backbone by exploiting advanced multi-radio, multi-channel
    and multi-rate capabilities, using heterogeneous wireless technologies and directional
    antennas [43]. This means that a WMN environment is characterized by a rich link
    and path diversity, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to find paths
    that can satisfy the application requirements. Effective channel assignment solutions
    have been developed to construct robust and efficient multi-path wireless-mesh
    backbones [44], [45], while several routing protocols able to exploit the link
    and path diversity have been designed, e.g., [46], [47], [48]. The multifaceted
    characteristics of a WMN complicate the path selection process. For example, the
    interference in WMNs is a very complex phenomenon, and the routing process must
    be aware of the interference existing between links and traffic flows to take
    advantage of the multi-channel and multi-radio capabilities [49]. In addition,
    in most application scenarios the portion of traffic that a mesh router delivers
    to other routers in the network (i.e., intra-mesh traffic) will be minimal with
    respect to the traffic conveyed over connections established with external hosts
    (i.e., traffic to Internet). As a result, most WMN traffic is usually between
    the mesh clients and the mesh gateway(s). This implies that traffic gets aggregated
    at the mesh gateways, which can have a negative effect on the network performance.
    For instance, depending on the network topology and the routing strategy, many
    mesh routers may select the same gateway and congestion levels can build up excessively
    on the shared wireless channel around the gateway. This may also lead to an uneven
    utilization of the gateways’ resources. As a consequence routing protocols must
    carefully take into consideration the distribution of traffic loads (e.g., see
    “Quality of Service in Mesh Networks” in [1]). Nowadays, WMN is a consolidated
    networking paradigm to realize wireless-backbone infrastructures in a cost-effective
    manner for different purposes, e.g., providing public Internet access in metropolitan
    areas4 (supporting a wide range of services ranging from security surveillance
    to intelligent transportation services), or supporting connectivity in harsh environments
    where cabling is not an option. From a research standpoint, the interest in WMN
    has been progressively diminishing but some aspects are still active research
    areas, such as: efficient mobility support (e.g., for vehicle-roadside communication
    in urban transport systems) [50], advanced Quality of Service support at very
    high data rates (e.g., for multimedia distribution in smart homes) [4] and robust,
    secure, and effective routing and forwarding protocols, e.g., [51], [52], [53],
    [54]. 4. Opportunistic networking5 Opportunistic Networks (ONs) are an evolution
    of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), and are considered as a particular case of
    delay/disruption tolerant networks (DTNs). While in MANETs mobility is assumed
    such that end-to-end paths exist between source-destination pairs, and path disruption
    is a possible but not usual event, in ONs the network is frequently partitioned,
    due to battery discharge, to the short radio range combined with both mobility
    and node sparseness, and to the low reliability of wireless links. For this reason,
    source-destination paths are likely to never exist. Thus, while MANETs can hide
    node mobility, ONs need to expose node mobility and exploit it through the store-carry-and-forward
    paradigm [55]. According to this paradigm, data are “moved” across the network
    not only through message passing amongst nodes, but also through the movements
    of the nodes themselves, which carry messages while waiting to enter in reciprocal
    radio range with either a message destination or a node suitable to reach the
    destination. In this sense, ONs are similar to DTNs, although the standard bundle
    protocol [56] designed for DTNs seems inadequate for ONs. Opportunistic networking
    has been traditionally considered as a mean to provide communication services
    mainly to portable devices (e.g., smartphones) in the absence of a fixed infrastructure,
    or when the cellular network is considered not convenient in terms of either bandwidth
    availability or cost. It is in this form that they have been extensively studied
    in the literature, as we discuss in Section 4.1. However, as we show later on,
    there are challenging and exciting recent developments that promise to bring opportunistic
    networks research into a new and fascinating era. 4.1. ONs: enabling mechanisms
    and consolidated research results At its onset, research on opportunistic networks
    focused on the enabling mechanisms for opportunistic data exchange, i.e., (i)
    on understanding human mobility and human social relationships in order to exploit
    them when forwarding messages, and (ii) on the basics of data delivery in standalone
    ONs. The dynamics of encounters between nodes is of paramount importance, as their
    duration affects the amount of data that can be exchanged between two nodes, while
    their frequency and pattern affect delivery delay and delivery probability, respectively.
    This is why the gathering of mobility and encounter data, their analysis and modeling,
    are one of the most investigated fields. Large public repositories of encounter
    and mobility traces are available for researchers (e.g. CRAWDAD [57]), and many
    works have been published that analyze those traces ([58], [59], [60], [61], [62],
    [63], [64], [65] to cite just a few). It is now well recognized that several parameters
    describing human mobility and encounters follow a power law distribution, such
    as the distance covered by a movement between two places; the visiting time, return
    time, and visiting frequency of a location; the contact duration and inter-contact
    time between pairs of persons (see, e.g., [66] for an extensive survey). Based
    on these results, several mobility models have been implemented ([67], [68], [69],
    [70] amongst others), able to supply synthetic traces satisfying the power law
    distribution and well approximating real traces, which can be used for experimentation
    and validation of solutions designed for ONs. Data delivery in ONs takes the form
    of routing and content dissemination. In routing, communications are host-centric,
    since messages have explicit source and destination. In data dissemination, communications
    are content-centric: messages are tagged based on their content and the goal is
    to bring messages to users that are interested in this content regardless of the
    identities of content consumers/producers. Routing issues in ONs have been thoroughly
    analyzed in the literature, from both an algorithmic and a performance modeling
    standpoint (see [71], [72] for a survey of the main results in this area). Since
    randomized routing schemes (e.g., [73], [74], [75]) have proven valuable only
    for quite homogenous mobility environments, the spotlight in the routing scene
    has been taken by utility-based schemes. Utility-based schemes ([76], [77], [78],
    [79], [80], [81] to cite a few) are able to exploit the unique forwarding features
    of individual nodes in terms of frequency of contacts, social relationships, general
    context, and even resource availability (memory, battery, etc.) on the user device.
    Alongside algorithms, recently several analytical models have also been proposed,
    ranging from models that address simple homogeneous mobility scenarios to models
    that address heterogeneity and also depart from the simplifying exponential assumption
    for inter-contact times [82], [83], [84], [85]. Due to the availability of this
    huge body of work, recent proposals for new ONs routing protocols often represent
    minor variations on the main ideas behind the established protocols mentioned
    above. Thus, we argue that — unless a paradigm shift is proposed or new evidence
    emerges from field experiments or new applications are envisioned that call for
    improved or refined routing strategies (see e.g., opportunistic crowd sensing
    discussed later on) — research activities on this topic should be put on hold.
    Content dissemination in ONs was also quite exhaustively investigated in the past
    years. Differently from routing, in this case a node stores a content because
    either the local user is interested in it, or the node is willing to cooperate
    in the content dissemination when it encounters interested nodes (possibly, it
    is the content generator). The goal here is to select what content items a node
    should store, as a trade-off of several local and global aspects, such as local
    memory availability and interest in the item, probability for the node to encounter
    other nodes interested in the item, item popularity, number of item copies in
    the system (i.e., of nodes concurrently performing that item dissemination), load
    balancing amongst nodes. In most proposals (e.g., [86], [88], [89]), these parameters
    are weighted through utility functions that rank the items so as to balance effective
    delivery vs. resource consumption. The ranking prioritizes the exchange of items
    most relevant and less disseminated so far. Alternatively, the items may be related
    to a certain geographical area within which their spreading is bounded [87]. In
    all cases, the decision must be taken based only on local observations. Works
    exist that consider the issue of performing accurate decisions in spite of maintaining
    incomplete observation history [90]. The possibility of breaking up large content
    into pieces and deciding what pieces to exchange has also been investigated [91].
    Open areas of research in this field concern the use of recommender systems and
    machine learning mechanisms to predict which content items may be of interest
    for which users thus providing indications to caching policies. Adopting those
    mechanisms could help to incentivize the cooperation amongst users, thus supplying
    better performance in terms of both user satisfaction in obtaining content of
    interest, and convenient resource usage. 4.2. ONs out of the research lab While
    research on standalone opportunistic networks has thrived, it is now time for
    ONs to exit the research realm and enter into people''s real lives. However, two
    factors act as the main showstoppers: the human factor and the technology factor.
    As for the human factor, performing experiments of significant size and temporal
    length requires the repeated involvement of a user base willing to devote their
    time and patience to testing the prototype of a research product. While this can
    still be feasible for a one-time experiment (e.g., recruiting people attending
    a conference for several days), it is hard to replicate the experiment later on
    or bring it in a real daily life environment. However, this is crucial for testing
    the effectiveness of opportunistic networks and how people might react to them.
    In fact, the way in which people are actually inclined to collaborate and share
    the resources of their devices for the goals of the ONs remains not yet understood.
    Indeed, when two nodes come in reciprocal radio range, there are several reasons
    why they might decide to not exploit the formed link, e.g. resource shortage (in
    terms of battery power, computation or memory availability), scarce trust in the
    other part, selfishness, lack of interest in the content the other node would
    like to relay. This attitude can impact on the real connectivity of the ON and
    thus on their communication capability, and might require the development of adequate
    incentive policies. Several studies have been carried out to understand the effect
    of human behavior on the performance of ONs [92], [93], [94] and solutions have
    been proposed to overcome selfishness [95] and to incentivize cooperation [96],
    [97], [98]. However, all these works are based on some abstract and general model
    of selfishness with little ground truth specific to ONs. To the best of our knowledge,
    the only empirical evaluation of altruism in opportunistic networks has been provided
    in [99]. A better insight into the above issues can be gained only through the
    deployment of prototypes and applications whose widespread use would provide significant
    data about how people use ONs. Unfortunately, very few applications for opportunistic
    networking are available, which can be classified into four categories. First,
    there are prototypes developed for specific research purposes, such as gathering
    data about opportunistic contacts [100]. To this class belong also proofs of concepts
    such as the opportunistic jukebox in [101], where users opportunistically exchange
    musical content among themselves and/or with fixed points in the environment,
    and Ateneo On Fly [102], which allows content sharing among professors and students
    in a campus, where infostations are adopted to mediate the communications. Second,
    and perhaps similar, there are experimental opportunistic infrastructures to supply
    networking services in rural areas, such as [103], and [104], which supports search
    of both friends and data, and resource sharing. The applications in both classes
    above are likely of extemporary or niche use, and they are not available to consumers.
    Third, there are middleware infrastructures that do not provide applications per
    se; rather they supply services to deploy applications over an ON. An example
    is the CAMEO platform [105], which maintains the context of each user, allowing
    to make users aware of their neighbors and of the existence of content that may
    be of interest for them. Finally, there are genuine apps available in stores;
    two examples are Twimight [106] and SocialPal [107]. Twimight is an app for Android
    devices that allows to epidemically spread a tweet amongst users having the app
    installed, exploiting opportunistic encounters and the Bluetooth technology. Messages
    may be sent to the Internet once a participant device detects an Internet connection
    available. It has been designed to work in disaster scenarios, where cellular
    networks become unavailable. The SocialPal framework includes applications enabling
    communication through opportunistic interactions. For instance, the nearbyPeople
    app allows a person to discover the common friends in online social networks shared
    with users in the neighborhood, without revealing his/her own identity, thus supporting
    the establishment of new relationships. So far, all the above applications are
    used by small communities of users, especially in comparison with the huge base
    of potential users. Hence, there is still the need of large scale test beds that
    provide insights on the use of ONs in real environments and of widespread commercial
    apps that make ONs popular among users. It is interesting to notice that all the
    above prototypes rely on one-hop ad hoc data exchange. This is a direct consequence
    of the difficulty in using existing wireless technologies to implement opportunistic
    communications, what we have referred to as the technology hindrance. In fact,
    there are no mature solutions implemented on off-the-shelf mobile devices that
    enable seamless multi-hop ad hoc communications, and even currently available
    research solutions (e.g. WiFi-Opp [108]) are suboptimal. On Android devices, WiFi
    Direct, which is considered the best viable alternative by many, was not designed
    with opportunistic networking in mind and often requires cumbersome configuration
    (in particular when multiple groups of devices are involved [109]) and annoys
    the user with many interruptions for explicit connection acceptance. Opportunistic
    communications on iOS devices are even less understood. We believe that this is
    a major obstacle to the deployment of opportunistic networks in real life, thus
    representing one of the top priorities from the research standpoint. Even playing
    with the technological cards we are dealt, there still remains the problem that
    ad hoc communications tend to be very energy hungry [110]. This affects both the
    QoS in the network (because devices with no battery left simply will not deliver
    messages on behalf of other nodes) and user satisfaction (users will be less willing
    to join an ON if they are afraid their battery will be drained in a few hours).
    There are not many works in the literature explicitly addressing the problem of
    energy optimization in ONs. Those who do, mainly pursue the two lines of (i) optimizing
    neighbor discovery (which is typically very expensive in terms of energy) [111],
    [112], [113] and (ii) alternatively switching roles when a different energy expenditure
    is involved in the host-client roles of a pairwise wireless connection [114].
    Despite these attempts, energy issues in ONs still remain mostly unaddressed,
    and an open research challenge for ONs of the future. 4.3. Crowd sensing/computing
    and Opportunistic IoT According to the crowd-sensing paradigm, people with their
    smart devices, willingly or unwillingly, represent potential sensing nodes distributed
    across cities, see Section 7. For example, the microphones of smartphones can
    be used to measure the noise level in the environment, and these samples, put
    together, can provide a very detailed map of the noise pollution across a reference
    area. Given the distributed and spontaneous nature of this sensing paradigm, the
    use of opportunistic communications has been recently put forward. However, as
    discussed in [115], data delivery solutions designed for legacy opportunistic
    networks can unlikely be taken as they are, since they fail to take into account
    the specificity of a crowd sensing environment, such as the spatio-temporal correlation
    between sensory data. In addition, sensory data are typically of small size but
    manifold, so the network might be overloaded very soon. For this reason, in-network
    processing techniques should also be exploited. Besides, for reducing data deluge
    in crowd sensing, in-network processing is also a promising research direction
    per se. In fact, current portable devices also own non-negligible computing capabilities,
    which may be used for distributed processing. First envisioned in [116], the idea
    has been then investigated in [117], where its viability is studied and a framework
    for its implementation is proposed. A first attempt to deploy these concepts is
    represented by [118], while in [119], [120], [115] the possibility of involving
    opportunistic users in pervasive environment sensing is explored. We believe that
    there is still a lot of research in this direction: one can envision a connected
    world of Internet, fixed infrastructures, opportunistic nodes and smart things
    [121], [122], where users equipped with wireless devices interact seamlessly with
    all the network components, acting not only as final service users, but also as
    providers of data, memory, processing and bandwidth resources to others. In this
    sense, opportunistic networking becomes another enabling technology in the development
    of the Internet of Things. 4.4. ONs in HetNets Due to the unprecedented mobile
    traffic growth, not compensated by an equivalent increase in cellular capacity,
    a research trend of the last few years has been to exploit heterogeneous wireless
    technologies for cellular traffic offloading [123], [124]. Within this framework,
    opportunistic device-to-device communications operate in synergy with the cellular
    infrastructure and are seen as capacity enhancer in a terminal-to-terminal delayed
    offloading scenario [125]. Content dissemination is an application particularly
    relevant to data offloading, since a single piece of content is shared by many
    interested users. Thus, once a few copies are injected via the cellular infrastructure,
    the remaining ones can be disseminated by the users themselves, which communicate
    opportunistically with each other. The cellular network only takes over in case
    content has yet to reach the interested users after a predetermined deadline.
    Research on this topic has pursued two main directions: the optimal selection
    of the subset of nodes to which the content should be initially injected [126],
    [127], [128] and the understanding of what type of traffic should be offloaded
    and how [129], [130], [123]. On the technological side, the LTE Direct technology
    [131] is under development, with the specific aim of allowing discovery of resources
    (e.g. people, services) in the same cell as the device, and direct device-to-device
    communication. This technology is still in its infancy, research in the field
    is at the very beginning, and its potential and impact have yet to be determined.
    Despite the fervent research activities in the last few years, several problems
    remain open, such as how to integrate in a coherent architecture the different
    data offloading opportunities, or to what extent the operator should impose a
    control on the content dissemination process (see [125] for a thorough discussion).
    Besides these, ON-based data offloading shares many open problems with standalone
    opportunistic networks, such as willingness of users to cooperate, energy issues,
    and lack of test beds. 4.5. Cloud-assisted ONs In a heterogeneous network, the
    availability of a cellular link connecting mobile devices to the Internet opens
    up the possibility of cloud-assisted networking. The cloud can be exploited to
    assist either the cellular infrastructure or mobile devices. As far as mobile
    devices are concerned, several proposals [132], [133], [134], [135] suggest offloading
    heavy computations to the cloud in order to save energy on mobile devices (thus
    addressing also the energy issues discussed previously). Unfortunately, in practice
    currently available solutions are able to offload very few computations, and even
    worse, since the most energy hungry applications are actually those that involve
    communications, rather than computation, current solutions do not prove very effective
    [134]. An original take on using the cloud infrastructure is discussed in [136],
    where the authors suggest performing neighbor discovery on the cloud (since it
    only involves sending a tiny amount of information) and delegating data exchange
    to local pairwise WiFi contacts. When used for offloading the cellular infrastructure,
    the cloud is usually assigned the role of implementing the control plane of the
    data offloading process [137]. This relieves the burden on the cellular infrastructure
    while at the same time moving the control of content dissemination from the cellular
    operators to third-parties, thus potentially opening up new business opportunities.
    Despite these preliminary contributions, however, the role a cloud infrastructure
    can play in hybrid opportunistic networks is still largely unexplored and we believe
    it deserves significantly more attention from the research community. 4.6. Grand
    challenges Three main directions have characterized the ON research: human mobility
    and mobility models, routing protocols and data dissemination. The research in
    these areas is now quite consolidated and there is a very limited space for novel
    and high-quality contributions. On the other hand, new exciting research opportunities
    exist in addressing the following topics: • Make ONs enter people''s lives: dealing
    with this aspect requires delving into several facets, namely, (i) understanding
    how people behave and interact in an ON, and motivating users to join an ON, so
    as to both design appropriate solutions for real ONs and guarantee sufficient
    density of users in order to have effective opportunistic communication support;
    (ii) deploying prototypes and applications on a large scale; (iii) addressing
    the technological limitations that make multi-hop ad hoc communications between
    off-the-shelf devices a daunting task, also paying attention to improving and
    optimizing the energy consumed by the portable devices participating in an ON.
    • ONs and IoT: researches should investigate how opportunistic networking can
    be brought into the crowd sensing/computing and IoT domain. • ONs and other networking
    technologies: in order to extend the applicability of ONs, it is important to
    integrate ONs into a coherent architecture for HetNets and continue exploring
    the benefits that the integration of heterogeneous networking paradigms can bring.
    • ONs and clouds: following recent developments in network architecture, it is
    interesting to study how ONs can be enriched and assisted by a synergy with a
    cloud infrastructure, when available. 5. Vehicular networking6 Vehicular Ad hoc
    NETwork (VANET) is a multi-hop ad hoc network made up of vehicles that communicate
    among them by exploiting wireless technologies, generally, belonging to the 802.11
    family. In this network, the mobility of the network nodes (i.e., vehicles) is
    constrained by the road characteristics and the other vehicles moving along the
    road. Typically, power consumption is not an issue for this network, as vehicle
    batteries are continuously recharged. The high socio-economic value of vehicular
    applications pushed the international standardization bodies to develop technical
    specifications to be adopted by vehicle industry. Among these, it is worth reminding
    the IEEE 1609 standard family for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE)
    that has been developed upon the IEEE 802.11p standard [138]. VANET is a specialization
    of the multi-hop ad hoc network paradigm well motivated by the socio-economic
    value of advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aimed at reducing the
    traffic congestions, the high number of traffic road accidents, etc. Indeed VANET
    can support a large plethora of applications including safety traffic applications
    (e.g., collision avoidance, road obstacle warning, safety message disseminations,
    etc.), traffic information and infotainment services (e.g., games, multimedia
    streaming, etc.). For example, a car involved in an accident can exploit the possibility
    to directly communicate with other vehicles to inform nearby vehicles of the dangerous
    situation. Advanced ITS systems require both vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) and vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V) communications. In V2R communications, a vehicle typically exploits infrastructure-based
    wireless technologies, such as cellular networks, WiMAX and WiFi, to communicate
    with a roadside base station/access point. However the roadside units are not
    dense enough to guarantee the network coverage required by ITS applications, and
    hence V2V communications are adopted to extend the network connectivity/coverage
    and to guarantee better network performance. V2V communications are based on the
    “pure” multi-hop ad hoc network paradigm as MANET. Specifically, according to
    this paradigm, vehicles on the road dynamically self-organize in a VANET by exploiting
    their wireless communication interfaces. Therefore, in its initial stages, VANETs
    were thought of as a specialization of MANETs, where nodes moved along streets.
    As expected, researchers tried to apply existing MANET solutions (e.g. routing)
    to VANET scenarios. However, VANETs have very distinctive properties from MANET,
    and hence require very specific technologies and protocols. In particular, they
    exhibit a different network architecture, a topology with frequent network partitions,
    an uneven network density, as well as very strong demand for scalability due to
    the large number of vehicles that may form a VANET. Thus, it is well-known that
    MANET (and Wireless Sensor Network – WSN) solutions simply do not work in VANETs.
    Nowadays, this is something highly accepted and well-known within the research
    community. But, from time to time, we still receive contributions based on MANET
    or WSN protocols, which clearly do not scale with the number of nodes, or do not
    take advantage of any of the properties of VANETs such as the constrained mobility,
    the absence of strong energy constraints, or the ability of nodes to know their
    GPS position. The routing task is challenging in VANET due to the high mobility
    of vehicles and the possibility of sparse networking scenarios, which occur when
    the traffic intensity is low. This makes inefficient the legacy store-and-forward
    communication paradigm used in MANET and push toward the adoption of the more
    flexible, pragmatic and robust store-carry-and-forward paradigm adopted by the
    opportunistic networks (see the “Opportunistic Networking” section) [139]. In
    addition, whenever possible, V2V communications exploit V2R communications to
    make their communications more robust reducing some weaknesses and vulnerabilities
    of pure infrastructure-less communications. In VANETs, a special attention has
    been reserved to the development of optimized one-to-all (in a specific region)
    routing protocols as several applications developed for VANET use broadcasting
    (geocasting) communication services [140] to distribute a message from a vehicle
    to all other vehicles (in a given area). Broadcasting or geocasting are also the
    basic communication services for content dissemination in a VANET, i.e., the dissemination
    to other vehicles of a file containing relevant information (e.g., a city map
    or infotainment information such as a music mp3 file). Due to the intermittent
    connectivity conditions, the opportunistic paradigm applied to vehicular networks
    has recently generated a large body of literature mainly on routing protocols
    and data dissemination in vehicular networks (e.g., [141], [142]). In the current
    research scenario, a practice to avoid is that of proposing minor improvements
    to an existing protocol in a very specific scenario and network conditions. For
    example, a minor change to a routing protocol to achieve a limited increase in
    performance (e.g., only when vehicles are at a traffic jam), cannot be accepted
    for publication in a high quality journal. In addition, while so far we have published
    a plethora of communication protocols trying to solve very specific problems in
    very specific conditions (e.g., MAC, routing, management protocols, etc. [143],
    [144], [145], [146]), now we need to make a step forward, where the new protocol
    proposals should be integrated in a wider network architecture. We need to focus
    our future research in heterogeneous scenarios in which vehicles can exploit and
    combine all types of possible communication technologies to support advanced ITS
    applications. The case for communication protocols for hybrid VANETs has finally
    become the common scenario. During the last five years almost every communications
    paper in the area of VANETs considers such scenario with Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),
    Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications as well as road-side units (RSU)
    and access to cellular networks (e.g. LTE.). So, unless there is a very innovative
    and disruptive solution or technology, specific data communication protocols for
    VANETs, which cannot be integrated into a wider heterogeneous scenario with a
    diversity of devices, networks and applications, can be considered a cold topic
    in VANET research. A survey of the VANET research is presented, in the chapter
    by Awwad, Yi and Stojmenovic, in [1]. Few other chapters in same book survey the
    ongoing research activities on experimental testbeds and simulation tools. 5.1.
    Research challenges Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks continue being one of the most promising
    technological developments in the area of computer communications. After more
    than a decade of research and great advances in the field, interest in vehicular
    networks has extended beyond academia. ICT companies and car manufactures have
    come into play and many standardization efforts are also on their way. Moreover,
    public authorities, such as the European Commission (EC) in Europe and the Department
    of Transportation (DoT) in the USA, are also getting involved and promoting several
    Field Operational Test. The U.S. Federal Government announced last February that
    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is starting work on a regulatory
    proposal to require Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) devices in new vehicles, sometime,
    in the coming years. In Europe, ETSI has finally standardized higher layer networking
    protocols. With such a context, one may question whether the remaining efforts
    are just industrial, or there is still room for academic research. We must admit
    that many basic VANET communications topics lack research interest nowadays. However,
    there are open research challenges that need to be solved before VANET can be
    deployed to its full potential. In this section, we elaborate on that, with the
    aim of helping journal readers find interesting research opportunities. Hereafter,
    we discuss, without being exhaustive, some research opportunities in the context
    of VANETs. Knowing fundamental performance limits. While there are areas in VANET
    research with a very large number of research contributions, this is one of those
    in which we are lacking contributions. There are some papers on fundamental limits
    for data aggregation [147], asymptotic throughput capacity [148], the optimal
    broadcasting structure [149], and the multicast capacity for hybrid VANETs with
    directional antennas [150]. However, there are still many of the well-known fundamental
    limits questions that remain un-answered. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) for inter-vehicle
    communications. Although the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has
    allocated a total of 75MHz in the 5.9 GHz for DSRC, it is a reality that vehicular
    networks suffer from spectrum scarcity in scenarios with high density of nodes,
    or when infotainment services using high data rates, are considered. DSA has been
    one of the recent hot topics in wireless communications and can be a very interesting
    technology to solve the spectrum scarcity problem in VANETs. The basic idea is
    allowing unlicensed users to opportunistically exploit the spectrum opportunities
    that licensed users are not using. For instance, vehicles can opportunistically
    access to digital TV or 3G/4G licensed bands to get better QoS. Recent works over
    TV White Space (TVWS) have proven the feasibility of this approach, usually referred
    as Cognitive Radio VANETs (CR-VANETs) [151]. However, traditional DSA schemes
    assume static users. Thus, using DSA, cognitive radios and cooperative communications
    in VANETs poses a number of research challenges. During the last four years there
    has been an increasing number of papers on CR-VANETs, but there are still interesting
    open issues in many areas of VANETs such as routing, Quality of Experience (QoE),
    handling mobility and even on security. The reader can refer to [152] for a state-of-the-art
    in the matter and a list of interesting open issues. Simulation, validation and
    experimental results. Both simulation and experimentation have a major role in
    designing and evaluating the solutions developed for vehicular networks. It is
    widely recognized that simulation results are only significant when realistic
    models are considered within the simulation tool-chain. Indeed, in the simulation
    of vehicular networks a lot of attention has been dedicated to develop realistic
    models of roads, and of the vehicle mobility, by exploiting the extensive literature
    developed in the field of transportation systems, e.g., models of how cars move
    along a road taking into consideration their speeds, the distance among them,
    traffic signals, the road layout, etc. [153]. However, quite often research works
    on the subject are based on simplistic models unable to capture the unique characteristics
    of vehicular communication networks. As stated in [154], we count nowadays with
    enough tools to perform high-fidelity simulations and there is no excuse for not
    using them. For example, ns-2, ns-3, SWANS, OMNET++, OPNET are able to take as
    input trace files, generated by specialized vehicle mobility models (e.g., VanetMobiSim
    and SUMO), which provide realistic vehicle mobility behaviors. Of course, it would
    be desirable to have higher level of detail but for many of our research needs,
    they are adequate. However, in some scenarios, the interdependences among vehicle
    communications and their mobility patterns make the problem more complex. For
    example, when a congestion/accident occurs the communication among vehicles influences
    their mobility by triggering a road change and/or a speed reduction. For this
    kind of simulation, the above approach is not suitable and therefore the VANET
    community is currently developing simulators that are able to take into account
    the interdependencies between the vehicles’ mobility and their communications.
    For example, TraNS (Traffic and Network Simulation environment) integrates ns-2
    and SUMO by providing feedbacks from the network simulator (ns-2) to affect the
    mobility traces produced by the SUMO mobility simulator. Another important aspect
    to consider (to produce realistic VANET simulations) is related to the simulation
    of the wireless channel among vehicles and to/from roadside units taking into
    account how the radio signal propagates in this environment. An updated and in-depth
    discussion of VANET simulations models and tools can be found in “Mobility Models,
    Topology and Simulations in Vanet” [1]. At this stage, more research is needed
    in validating existing simulation software and models compared to experimental
    data. VANET prototypes have been extensively used to verify the feasibility of
    VANET solutions and the effectiveness of VANET applications. Several testbeds
    have been developed worldwide. Among these, it is worth remembering the CarTel
    project at MIT (which developed a 27-car testbed for testing V2V, V2R, road surface
    monitoring, etc.), the DiselNet project at UMass (which is based on 35 buses which
    implement a DTN-based communication paradigm), the ShanghaiGrid project (which
    involves thousands of taxies and buses for vehicle and traffic monitoring and
    environment sensing) and the pioneering FleetNet project (involving several companies
    and university in Germany to demonstrate their platform for inter-vehicle communications).
    An updated survey of VANET experimental activities can be found in “Experimental
    work on Vanet” [1]. We know the difficulty of running large-scale VANET experiments.
    However, for many parts of the system, small-scale experiments can serve to validate
    models and simulations and such research is both needed and valuable. Highly Heterogeneous
    VANET systems. There have been a number of solutions to deal with very specific
    problems in hybrid VANETs encompassing V2V, V2I and V2R communications such as
    broadcasting, data dissemination, routing, etc. However, we still need a lot of
    research to effectively manage those highly heterogeneous scenarios consisting
    of a plethora of technologies, addressing schemes, and simultaneously deployed
    applications. This kind of scenarios where everything is connected to everything
    using different technologies are difficult to handle and have been referred recently
    as Internet of Vehicles (IoV). One of the promising research directions in the
    short term is exploiting cross-layer designs especially for complementing ad hoc
    and existing cellular technologies so that applications can get the service they
    need, without having to know the underlying details of where the packet is to
    be routed. Such intelligent strategies for traffic offloading can help mitigate
    congestion problems while improving the overall QoS. There are many other mid-term
    and long-term open research questions in such scenarios such as how to accommodate
    security without negatively impacting some of the devices (e.g. energy in sensors),
    how to orchestrate the operation of data communications while still preserving
    the required scalability constraints, how to manage QoS so that competing applications
    with strict requirements (e.g. safety and infotainment) can coexist, etc. General
    directions on how to explore research solutions in these highly heterogeneous
    scenarios can be found in [155]. Application-aware VANET networking. One common
    pitfall that we often see in many VANET papers is that of considering communication
    scenarios that are not relevant for vehicular network applications. They can be
    an interesting engineering exercise, but that certainly does not help advancing
    the field. Application needs are the ones that drive communication protocol design
    and not the other way around. In WSNs, it is a common practice to employ cross-layer
    schemes whereby network protocols try to minimize energy consumption by only getting
    data that is relevant for the applications, or getting only enough level of detail
    about the data. However, such close interrelation between applications and networking
    protocols have not been exploited enough in VANETs. With the advent of the so
    called Vehicular Sensor Networks (VSN) in which vehicles act as moving sensors
    collecting data, we should explore if VANET networking protocols can employ similar
    data-centric techniques. Why asking all vehicles in an area to report data? How
    many is enough to detect traffic congestion? Mobility and other VANET properties
    make solutions such as compressive sensing and similar schemes not directly applicable
    to VANETs. However, finding similar data-centric designs for VANETs is certainly
    an interesting research topic that can bring important benefits in terms of reducing
    spectrum usage, improving performance, etc. Information-centric networking for
    VANETs. Significant enhancements in VANET are expected by adapting new communication
    paradigms to VANETs. For instance, it is worth exploring the use of Information-Centric
    Networking (ICN) [156], [157], [158] in vehicular networks because it can bring
    important benefits. By using named content, name-based routing, and in-network
    content caching applications can just say what they need without knowing where
    it is. Although there exists already some works using ICN [159], [160] and content
    caching strategies in VANETs [161], there are still many open research questions
    on how to make it work efficiently in such highly heterogeneous scenarios. Software
    Defined VANETs. As we have learned from the Internet, large-scale deployment requires
    a very flexible architecture. For the case of VANETs we are in very similar situation
    where industry is starting to consider some deployments, but getting global acceptance
    of protocols and being able to change them in the future may not be really easy.
    One promising direction to avoid repeating the same mistake we did with the Internet
    could be employing the emerging network paradigm of Software Defined Networking
    (SDN). The idea is to separate the control and data planes, so that the forwarding
    behavior of vehicles can be controlled externally from the underlying network
    infrastructure. Some initial study in [162] established a starting proposal on
    how SDN can be brought to VANETs. However, in the same way that SDN is still a
    growing research discipline, its application to VANET is also in its early stages
    and there is a lot of research to be done. However, this new paradigm can bring
    interesting benefits so as to make highly heterogeneous VANET systems mentioned
    above easier to manage and easier to integrate in the future with other new paradigms
    such as IoT and the so called Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Security and privacy.
    Security is one of the research areas that have received significant attention
    from VANET researchers since its inception [163], [164]. Obviously, many of the
    envisioned VANET applications (especially safety) cannot be really deployed without
    strong security and privacy guarantees. There has been a significant advance in
    security and privacy for VANETs during the last decade. In fact, as stated in
    [165], there are aspects such as using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Public
    Key Infrastructures (PKI) and Digital Certificates (DC) in which there is clear
    agreement. This is also the case for aspects such as guaranteeing message integrity
    through the use of digital signatures and the use of tamper-proof devices in vehicles.
    Solving privacy issues using pseudonyms and using reputation schemes to monitor
    consistency and detect misbehavior are also highly researched topics in which
    most research issues are solved. As in MANET, security mechanisms that enforce
    the correctness and integrity of the network operations are not sufficient and
    mechanisms to guarantee/enforce the cooperation among network nodes have also
    been devised (e.g., see [166], and the reference herein). To summarize there are
    many security aspects for which we have good solutions. However, we still lack
    scalable solutions being able to work in large-scale deployments. We also lack
    solutions that take into account how to achieve a good trade-off between security
    and the amount of required network resources that are needed for its operation.
    In particular, when we consider highly heterogeneous scenarios as mentioned above,
    we still lack an integrated and general security and privacy solution that can
    work with such level of diversity of devices and technologies while still being
    effective and practical. In addition, we need to further investigate on security
    of devices and low-level security. As recently shown [167], even if protocols
    are secure, if systems are not, car hacking can become something very common in
    the near future. 6. Wireless sensor networks7 The increased success in integrating
    communication and sensing circuitries on miniaturized devices has led to the emergence
    of the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) paradigm [168], [169], [170], [171], [172],
    [173]. WSNs represent a “special” class of multi-hop ad hoc networks that are
    developed to control and monitor a wide range of events and phenomena, e.g., precision
    agriculture, surveillance, pollution monitoring, health monitoring, structural
    monitoring [174], [175], [176], [177], [178], [179], [180]. The application driven
    view, and the need for solving concrete problems, made WSNs successful both in
    the academia and industry. In a WSN, a number of sensor nodes are deployed to
    monitor an area. These nodes can communicate directly among themselves by exploiting
    their wireless interfaces, and typically pursue multi-hop paths (through the other
    sensor nodes) to disseminate the collected information toward a sink node. The
    sink node interface the WSN to remote command centers through dedicated long-haul
    links and/or other interested users through the Internet. The design of WSNs highly
    depend on the specific application scenario and performance requirements in terms
    of reliability, timeliness etc. For some of these applications, such as space
    exploration, coastal and border protection, combat field reconnaissance and search
    and rescue, it is envisioned that a set of mobile sensor nodes will be employed
    to collaboratively monitor an area of interest and track certain events or phenomena.
    By deploying these sensors for autonomous/unattended operation in harsh environments,
    risk to human life can be avoided and the cost of the application can also be
    lowered. In other applications such as structure monitoring and manufacturing
    automation, the WSNs operate in controlled setups. Initially researchers considered
    energy and resource constraints to be the key challenge in designing WSNs in comparison
    with general ad-hoc networks [181], [182]. Scalability, security and data fidelity
    have also been deemed design objectives, which made work on routing, MAC, clustering,
    coverage, data integrity, etc. to be dominating. A comprehensive library of techniques
    has been developed over the past 15 years or so. After such extensive research,
    the technical community expects mature solutions to emerge for practical application
    scenarios. Consequently, cross-layer and multi-objective design methodologies
    are of great interest. In addition, supporting applications in 3D environments
    [183] and under unstable and dynamic connectivity considerations are also of interest
    [184]. Examples include underwater sensor networks, airborne sensor networks,
    and robot-assisted sensor networks [185]. The following subsections highlight
    what we view as being accomplished (extensively researched) and what the research
    community ought to focus on in the next years. 6.1. Conventional and widely-researched
    design issues The following areas have received the most attention of the WSN
    researchers. The results have enriched the literature with numerous publications.
    We just provide general highlights and point out few topics that are worthy further
    investigation related to these areas. • Node placement: Careful node placement
    can be a very effective optimization means for achieving the desired design goals,
    e.g., energy costs, coverage, connectivity [186]. Since many variants of the placement
    optimization problem is NP-hard, numerous heuristics have been proposed. Published
    work spans stationary and dynamic node positioning schemes, random and controlled
    placement strategies, as well as analytical studies [187]. • Topology management:
    The primary objective of existing topology management techniques in WSNs is to
    achieve sustainable coverage while maintaining network connectivity and conserving
    energy. For example, these techniques are employed to track the status of communication
    links among nodes, to conserve energy by switching off some of the nodes without
    degrading network coverage or connectivity, to support hierarchical task assignment
    for data aggregation, to balance the load on existing nodes and links, or to provide
    scalability by minimizing medium access collision and limiting overhead [188],
    [189], [190], [191], [192]. Provisioning multi-tier hierarchy through node grouping
    into clusters is one of the popular topology formation methodologies with techniques
    factoring in all sort of parameters and metrics, e.g., resource conservation,
    load, energy harvesting, delay, etc. [193], [194]. • Medium access arbitration:
    The distributed operation of typical WSNs has fuelled interest in devising MAC
    protocols that are lightweight in terms of control messaging overhead, limits
    passive listening and support sleep modes [195], [196], [197]. While quite a few
    of the published MAC protocols could yield good performance using single medium
    access sharing methodologies, e.g., time or frequency base multiple access, a
    number of protocols, such as [198], [199] have demonstrated that combing multiple
    methodologies is more effective. Some of the protocols have matured and become
    widely accepted as the de-facto standard [200]. Support for quality of service
    and exploiting advanced physical layer features have been also be studied as well
    [201], [202], [203]. • Routing, data dissemination and fusion: Routing data in
    WSNs is an area that has been researched quite extensively, or probably exhaustively.
    Both flat and hierarchical routing trees have been investigated. Numerous centralized
    and distributed path formation schemes have been developed [204], [205], [206].
    In the design of a WSN routing protocol, energy efficiency is a main design objective
    [207], [208]. Routing schemes with mobile nodes and/or mobile sinks have been
    also extensively investigated [209], [210], [211], [212]. Data aggregation and
    fusion have been factored in some of the work [213], [214], [215], [216], [217],
    [218]. Link and network cross-layer optimization has been popular as well [219].
    • Secure communication: The resource constraints of the sensor nodes and the lack
    of continuously-accessible trusted authorities have been deemed the major differentiator
    for WSNs from contemporary networks [220], [221], [222]. One of the research thrusts
    has been in the management of cryptographic keys [223]. Nonetheless, the bulk
    of the research efforts have been dedicated to devising lightweight versions of
    contemporary security solutions in order to suit WSNs and trading off attack resilience
    for resource conservation [224], [225], [226], [227]. After the development of
    an extensive library of techniques, the community is eager to see systems that
    utilize a subset of these techniques in the implementation of real life applications.
    It is argued that it is time to judge the practicality of what has been developed
    in the above areas of research. Therefore, experience with engineered systems
    and actual WSN deployment is of great interest; particularly cross-layer optimization
    and synergetic interaction among the various techniques will be invaluable for
    both researchers and practitioners. In addition, some specific problems can still
    benefit from additional research efforts despite the major progress made to-date.
    The following topics can be noted: • Decentralized node placement and topology
    self-configuration: While quite a few techniques have pursued self-spreading of
    nodes and relocation of assets, adaptive node positioning solutions that can deal
    with dynamic changes in the application requirements and emerging events are of
    interest. Example scenarios include the autonomous recovery from failure and self-reconfiguration
    to cope with varying QoS requirements. In many WSN applications, the network is
    deployed in harsh environments such as battlefields where the nodes are susceptible
    to damage. Although a number of distributed solutions have been proposed for tolerating
    single node failures [228], the loss of multiple collocated nodes is very challenging.
    Distributed recovery schemes for such multi-node failure are in demand. A similar
    scenario is when QoS requirements, e.g., coverage and data fidelity, dynamically
    vary due to the emergence of an event that warrants reshaping of the WSN topology.
    • Anti-traffic analysis measures: Intercepting a wireless transmission enables
    an adversary to locate the sender and estimate its proximity to the receiver.
    Analyzing the WSN traffic by correlating interceptions throughout the network
    enables the adversary to locate key network assets, namely, the base-station and
    active data sources, which may then be targeted by pinpointed attacks. This is
    serious vulnerability that cannot be mitigated by contemporary security primitives
    such as packet encryption. Similarly, camouflaging or hiding nodes does not provide
    protection when their location is unveiled. Furthermore, employing spread spectrum
    technologies does not constitute a sufficient countermeasure since it reduces
    rather than eliminates the prospect of transmission detection and interception.
    Moreover, the broadcast nature of the wireless links and the traffic pattern in
    the network make anonymous communication techniques developed in the realm of
    peer-to-peer networks inapplicable and ineffective for concealing the location
    of WSN nodes. While location privacy of data sources in the realm of WSN has received
    some attention [229], we argue that in many application scenarios the sources
    are not as important given the implicit node redundancy. Instead, the base-station
    becomes the favorite target for the adversary, especially when considering its
    major role in managing the WSN and interfacing it with remote command centers
    [230], [231], [232]. Therefore, we view the problem of guarding a base-station
    against traffic analysis attacks warrants increased attention. • WSN with voluminous
    data: In applications that involve imaging and multi-media sensors [233], the
    volume of data overwhelms the network communication resources and in-network data
    processing becomes necessary. Of particular interest is the integration of emerging
    techniques for compressive sensing and big data analytics with contemporary WSN
    management primitives [234]. Computation and communication trade-off, balancing
    delay, energy and data fidelity metrics, and the pursuance of heterogeneity in
    WSN design are important issues that are worthy of investigation. 6.2. Research
    topics of growing importance In recent years, a number of emerging WSN applications
    have stimulated interest and motivated researchers to refocus their efforts. We
    have grouped the areas that we believe are worthy attention into two sets. The
    following enumerates these areas, briefly highlights key issues and points out
    publications that can be checked for detailed analysis. Our objective is to hopefully
    steer the efforts towards these areas and direct the readers to open research
    problems in WSNs. 6.2.1. WSN for challenging environments/applications With the
    continual advance in low-power and high-density electronics and increased level
    of miniaturization, WSNs have being gaining ground and finding applications in
    challenging environments and need to achieve very ambitious objectives. The following
    highlights popular examples of these applications: • Underwater WSNs: Examples
    of underwater WSN applications include environmental state monitoring, search
    and rescue, oceanic profile measurements, leak detection in oil fields, tracking
    seismic activities, seabed profiling, search-and-rescue and coastal patrol missions,
    distributed surveillance, and navigation [235], [236], [237], [238], [239], [240],
    [241]. For these applications, either a set of sensor nodes or autonomous underwater
    vehicles (AUVs) will be deployed to collaboratively monitor an area of interest
    and track targets, e.g., submarines, or track certain phenomena. Since radio waves
    tend to get absorbed in water, underwater applications have to rely on free-space
    optics [242], laser [243], or acoustic [244], [245], [246] rather than radio channels.
    However, free-space optics have a limited range, using laser requires significantly
    high power, and acoustic channels are slow and sensitive to the water properties,
    suffer major distortion, and have low bandwidth. To be effective, directional
    transmission will be required or at least highly recommended for these channel
    types. Therefore, the link establishment will be further complicated by the inherit
    mobility of the node due to the water current. Furthermore, the mobility, link
    instability and the 3-D environment make node localization and topology management
    very challenging. Although some progress has been made over the past few years
    and node platforms and products have started to emerge [236], [247], [248], the
    research community has a way to go before mature solutions are developed. For
    a detailed discussion of the design issues of underwater sensor networks, the
    reader is referred to [249], [250], [251], [252], [253]. • Underground WSNs: In
    most developed societies, utility companies rely on an extensive network of pipelines
    for supplying natural gas and water to residences and industries. The bulk of
    the utility pipeline system is laid belowground and would significantly benefit
    from the use of WSN to monitor the structural integrity of the pipe segments,
    and to detect and locate leaks and clogs. Conserving water and countering pollution
    due to hazardous leaks have been a focal point for the public and government agencies;
    thus detecting and containing problems in early stages would be invaluable. Underground
    WSNs would also be useful for boarder security, e.g., detecting infiltration through
    illegally dug tunnels, and for tactical military missions, e.g., the deployment
    of smart landmines. In addition, underground WSNs find applications in precision
    agriculture by tracking the moisture and minerals levels in soils, and in disaster
    warning by monitoring seismic activities for early landslides and earthquakes.
    However, the implementation of underground WSNs faces major challenges [254],
    [255]. Unlike aboveground deployment, the propagation of electromagnetic signals
    is significantly restrained with a loss of more than 100 dB per meter [256]. Such
    high signal attenuation varies based on the type of soil and the moisture level.
    Raising the antenna of the individual nodes above ground and the use of wired
    links is logistically infeasible or impractical in most applications. While the
    topology of an underground WSN is controlled, the establishment of reliable communication
    links and harvesting energy for powering up the nodes complicate the node placement
    optimization. Few solutions have been worked out so far [257], [258], [259], [260],
    [261], and major research efforts are needed to tackle the underground WSNs design
    issues [262]. • Body Area WSNs: A body sensor network fundamentally consists of
    a set of wearable and implanted devices in the human body to continuously assess
    the health status through measuring key indicators, e.g., blood pressure, heart
    beat, etc. Meanwhile, the notion of Body Area Network (BAN) is a bit broader and
    involves devices that are not mounted on the human body. Although a BAN is widely-known
    as a tool for conducting medical studies and as an outpatient healthcare instrument
    [263], [264], [265], applications in the entertaining and gaming industry have
    recently emerged [23]. Most of the technical challenges for BANs are motivated
    by the physical characteristics of the involved devices. Fundamentally most of
    the numerous ongoing projects are multidisciplinary in nature [23], [263]. In
    addition to the complexity of the application-specific data fusion, the main design
    challenges include coping with the very stringent energy constraints for the employed
    devices and the relatively high path-loss when transmitting at low-power as a
    means to extend the network lifetime. These challenges become even more prominent
    with emergence of nano-scale devices [266], [267]. A major push from the biomedical
    industry to standardize the protocol stack and the application interface has yielded
    the IEEE 802.15.6 standard. However, the IEEE 802.15.6 standard opts to ensure
    interoperability rather than providing complete specifications of the MAC protocol.
    Therefore, optimal medium access sharing among the BAN nodes is an open and complex
    research problem given the energy constraints, delay sensitivity of the transmitted
    data, and the signal interface that the miniaturized BAN devices are subject to.
    In addition, supporting the integration of non-wearable sensors is an interesting
    research direction. With technological advances in gesture and facial expression
    analysis, a BAN can grow in scope to include sensor data that reflects the appearance
    of a human and factor that into the overall assessment of the body condition [268],
    [269]. For example, the presence of back pain or distress can be inferred if someone
    is bending during a walk. • Airborne WSNs: The recent years have witnessed major
    growth in the popularity and availability of small and battery-operated unmanned
    airborne platforms such as quadcopters and drones. The reliability and capabilities
    of these platforms have reached such an advanced level that an online retailer
    like Amazon is considering the use of quadcopters for package delivery if it receives
    regulatory approval [270]. The size of some of these platforms is as small as
    that of a bird and can be equipped with a wide variety of sensors. While unattended
    airborne vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in some WSNs as base-stations and
    as relays in order to enable connectivity among sensors on the ground [271], [272],
    [273] research on the use of a group of networked UAVs as an airborne WSN is still
    in an early stage. Compared to ground-based WSNs, a networked UAVs are not constrained
    by terrain and enable wide field-of-view sensing. In addition, an airborne WSN
    provides high levels of agility and adaptability to environment changes, and achieve
    broad temporal and spatial coverage. Given these advantages, the interest in the
    use of airborne WSNs in scientific, defense and civil applications has been rising
    [274], [275], [276], [277], [278], [279]. Nonetheless, the networking of UAVs
    is quite challenging, and mature and practical solutions for many of the design
    issues are yet to be developed. Most notable among the technical challenges are
    achieving accurate node localization, sustaining network connectivity, and supporting
    coordinated navigation and coverage. While airborne WSNs resemble MANETs in terms
    of mobility and energy constraints, the 3-D nature and the speed of node motion
    introduce major complications that would render published solutions for topology
    management in the realm of MANETs ineffective. In addition, the small form factor,
    weight and battery capacity constraints may make it infeasible to equip a node
    with GPS receivers; therefore, node localization and navigation have to be based
    on relative rather absolute coordinates and conducted in a cooperative manner
    while relying on error-prone techniques such as accelerometers and radio ranging
    [280], [281]. 6.2.2. Federated sensory systems The conventional view of a WSN
    is that it is an application specific. This view still holds and is consistent
    with the cost, energy and size constraints that a node is usually subject to,
    and which hinder the provision of generic capabilities. Nonetheless, with the
    increased deployment of WSNs it is envisioned that data sharing and sporadic and/or
    opportunistic interactions among multiple WSNs will be necessary to achieve emerging
    application needs. For example, the BANs of two individuals may exchange alerts
    when they get in range of one another. These alerts may be on pollution and unhealthy
    conditions or the risk that one of the two individuals may pose to the other,
    e.g., when some infection is suspected due to a high temperature. We view federation
    of multiple WSNs to be a major trend in the future where the capabilities of the
    individual WSNs will be combined to form a networked sensory system. Such federation
    is characterized as short-lived integration of features, e.g., sensing modality,
    and leverage of services (target tracking). In the following we highlight some
    federation scenarios and points out some technical issues that arise. Among federated
    sensory systems, the widespread use of mobile and other personal devices is generating
    the emergence of a new paradigm for sensing the physical world with human in the
    loop: phone sensing. This paradigm is generating a people-centric revolution of
    wireless sensor networks and therefore it will be discussed in a separate section
    (see Section 7). • Inter-networking diverse WSNs: In applications such as disaster
    management, fugitive tracking, target tracking, and military reconnaissance, it
    will be desirable to augment the capability of a WSN when some event of interest
    is detected. The objective for such capability augmentation is to boost the fidelity
    of the data, engage different and/or more powerful sensing modality, or to cope
    with increase in the scope/scale of the detected event. While the complexity for
    achieving such federation varies widely based on the application, three issues
    may be commonly faced. First, the federated networks may operate under different
    protocols; therefore, gateways will be required for inter-WSN data exchange. Second,
    a model will be needed to coordinate the various activities and synchronize the
    execution of tasks across individual WSNs in order to achieve the federation objective.
    Thirdly, a temporal and spatial baseline has to be defined to synchronize the
    time and map the coordinate systems of the federated networks. Only little efforts
    have been dedicated to the internetworking of WSNs, with the focus on federating
    an airborne WSN with ground-based [281], [282], [283], [284], [285] and with sea-based
    networks [286]. • Space SensorWeb: The vision of the SensorWeb project at NASA
    is to facilitate the federation of satellite-based sensing capabilities with ground
    and airborne WSNs [287], [288]. The objective is to support Earth science through
    multi-modality space- and ground-based sensory systems and to enable access to
    such a comprehensive sensory system via the Internet. For example, offering data
    from a diverse set of sensors would improve the understanding of physical phenomena,
    such as volcanic eruptions, desertification, climate change, tsunami, etc. Currently,
    a web interface is provided for scheduling satellite observations and a data log
    is then sent to requesters to be visualized using tools like Google Earth and
    alike. However, rather than such primitive arrangements, the technical goal is
    to automate the process so that the space, airborne and ground WSNs become inter-networked
    and autonomously trigger the observation activities based on the detected phenomena.
    The realization of the networking aspect of the Space SensorWeb is yet to gear
    up and many research problems are to be tackled. In addition to the issues mentioned
    above for inter-networking diverse WSNs, the Space SensorWeb requires the handling
    of very slow and intermittent satellite links, routing subject to QoS requirements,
    and dealing with diverse security and access control policies for individual WSNs.
    In general, the realization of Space SensorWeb involves complex integration issues
    across many domains such as security, delay tolerant networking, satellite communication,
    WSNs, etc. • WSN support for IoT: The prevalence of wireless communication technologies
    has motivated the introduction of the notion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) [9].
    An IoT refers to the pervasive interaction between entities, human, objects, animals,
    using wireless communication links without human coordination. The pervasive and
    autonomous inter-node interaction within an IoT requires standardized protocol
    interface. 6LoWPAN is gaining popularity as one of the suitable choices for standardization.
    Another characteristic of IoT is the lack of stable topology where links typically
    stay active for short durations due to node mobility. Interfacing WSN with an
    IoT would lead to the formation of a federated sensory system that serves a wide
    range of applications such as smart homes, efficient work space, factory automation,
    etc. [289]. Basically, the nodes in an IoT can leverage the WSN services without
    knowing how the network is architected and managed. To illustrate in a smart home
    one''s cell phone or vehicle can communicate with a controller at the garage door
    to turn on the light when arriving. The controller can connect with a WSN that
    tracks the weather in the surroundings to estimate the effect of clouds during
    the day and determine the intensity of light that suits the owner''s need while
    conserving energy. Even such a simple scenario requires major software and protocol
    support. Complex application scenarios involving mobility of the WSN as well as
    the IoT nodes is quite challenging [290], [291]. Research on WSN support for IoT
    is in early stage and is expect to attract lots of attention over the next few
    years, especially with advances in the development of nanoscale devices [292].
    7. Mobile-phone sensing8 In recent times, mobile phones (and other smart personal
    electronic devices) have shown rapid improvements in processing power, storage
    capacities and network data rates, and are quickly growing in the sophistication
    of the embedded-sensors. The mobile phones of today have evolved from merely being
    phones to full-fledged computing, sensing and communication devices. It is thus
    not surprising that over 5 billion people globally have access to mobile phones.
    These advances in mobile phone technology coupled with their ubiquity have paved
    the wave for the emerging of people-centric networking (and computing) paradigms.
    In fact, the major innovation introduced by mobile phones is the fact that they
    do move, and move with people (their owners). For this reason, the networking
    paradigms based on mobile phones are shifting from device-to-device paradigm toward
    people-to-people paradigm [4]. Opportunistic networks have been a first example
    of this new paradigm in which data forwarding is strongly coupled with the human
    mobility [293], but it is with the phone-sensing paradigm that we fully realize
    the people-centric networking and computing paradigm [294]. In mobile phone sensing
    (also known as crowd sensing) the physical world can be sensed, without deploying
    a sensor network, by exploiting the billions of users’ mobile devices/phones as
    location-aware data collection instruments for real world observations. The key
    idea is to empower the citizens’ mobile phones to collect and share sensed data
    from their surrounding environments using their mobile phones [294], [295], [296],
    [297]. Mobile phones, though not built specifically for sensing, can in fact readily
    function as sophisticated sensors. The camera on mobile phones can be used as
    video and image sensors. The microphone on the mobile phone, when it is not used
    for voice conversations, can double up as an acoustic sensor. The embedded GPS
    receivers on the phone can provide location information. Other embedded sensors
    such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and proximity sensors can collectively be used
    to estimate useful contextual information (e.g., is the user walking or traveling
    on a bicycle). Further, additional sensors can be easily interfaced with the phone
    via Bluetooth or wired connections, e.g., air pollution or biometric sensors.
    In mobile-phone sensing, citizens have a (passive or active) role in sensing the
    physical world. We typically refer to participatory sensing when citizens take
    an active role in using their devices to sense the world and publish and share
    the collected information. On the other hand, in opportunistic sensing the sensing
    activities are performed by the (opportunistic) exploitation of all the sensing
    devices available in the environment, including those available on personal devices
    without the need of a direct involvement of the devices’ owner [298]. Participatory
    sensing offers a number of advantages over traditional sensor networks that entails
    deploying a large number of static wireless sensor devices, particularly in urban
    areas. Firstly, since participatory sensing leverages existing sensing (mobile
    phones) and communication (cellular or WiFi) infrastructure, the deployment costs
    are virtually zero. Second, the inherent mobility of the phone carriers provides
    unprecedented spatiotemporal coverage and also makes it possible to observe unpredictable
    events (which may be excluded by static deployments). Third, using mobile phones
    as sensors intrinsically affords economies of scale. Fourth, the widespread availability
    of software development tools for mobile phone platforms and established distribution
    channels in the form of App stores makes application development and deployment
    relatively easy. Finally, by including people in the sensing loop, it is now possible
    to design applications that can dramatically improve the day-to-day lives of individuals
    and communities. This generates a cyber-physical convergence as the mobile phone
    acts as proxy of human behavior in the cyber world. While people really move into
    the physical dimension, their mobile phones sense the physical world and transfer
    the sensed information in the cyber world. A plethora of novel and exciting participatory
    sensing applications have emerged in recent years. CarTel [299] is a system that
    uses mobile phones carried in vehicles to collect information about traffic, quality
    of en-route WiFi access points, and potholes on the road. Micro-Blog [300] is
    an architecture that allows users to share multimedia blogs enhanced with inputs
    from other physical sensors of the mobile phone. Other applications of participatory
    sensing include the collection and sharing of information about urban air and
    noise pollution [301], [302] cyclist experiences [303], diets [304], or consumer
    pricing information in offline markets [305]. A typical participatory sensing
    application operates in a centralized fashion, i.e., the sensor data collected
    by the phones of volunteers are reported (using wireless data communications)
    to a central server for processing. The sensing tasks on the phones can be triggered
    manually, automatically or based on the current context. On the server, the data
    are analyzed and made available in various forms, such as graphical representations
    or maps showing the sensing results at individual and/or community scale. Simultaneously,
    the results may be displayed locally on the carriers'' mobile phones or accessed
    by the larger public through web. Participatory sensing can leverage and yet complicate
    the operation of and interaction with legacy WSNs. Basically, voluntary participants
    can augment the capabilities of a WSN and provide a wealth of additional sensor
    data. Despite the obvious advantage of increased fidelity through the sensor readings,
    participatory sensing can also allow bogus and inaccurate data that is a detriment
    to the quality and trustworthiness of WSN services, particularly when the volume
    of bogus participant samples is large. In addition, interaction with voluntary
    participants both in coordination and data collection would be stressful for the
    WSN communication and energy resources, especially when in-network data processing
    is applied. Therefore, algorithms are needed to determine when a WSN accepts/solicits
    participatory sensing based on a careful trade-off between performance and load.
    Moreover, a suite of protocols needs to be developed to enable participant recruitment,
    WSN access control, query processing, etc. Furthermore, participatory sensing
    will introduce privacy issues that WSNs typically are not concerned about [306],
    [307]. 7.1. Research challenges Since participatory sensing relies on existing
    networking and sensing infrastructure, the key challenges are associated with
    handing the data, i.e., data analysis and processing, ensuring data quality, protecting
    privacy, etc. We now present a short overview of the key research challenges posed
    by this new and exciting paradigm. We also discuss some recent work in overcoming
    these challenges. Dealing with incomplete samples. Since a participatory sensing
    system relies on volunteers contributing noise pollution measurements, these measurements
    can only come from the place and time where the volunteers are present. Furthermore,
    volunteers may prioritize the use of their mobile devices for other tasks. Or
    they may choose to collect data only when the phone has sufficient energy. Consequently,
    samples collected from mobile phones are typically randomly distributed in space
    and time, and are incomplete. The challenge is thus to recover the original spatiotemporal
    profile of the phenomenon being monitored from random and incomplete samples obtained
    via crowdsourcing. In [302], the authors have developed an innovative approach
    to deal with this issue using the technique of compressive sensing, in the context
    of a noise monitoring application. Inferring user context and activities. Inferring
    the surrounding context (e.g., is the user in a party or a quiet room) and activities
    (is the user walking, running, traveling by car, etc.) undertaken by the phone
    carrier is of interest in various participatory sensing applications. This is
    usually achieved using data collected by one or more embedded sensors in the phone,
    which include accelerometers, microphone, GPS, etc. At the high-level, this is
    essentially a machine learning problem, since we want to the phones to be embedded
    with the smarts to recognize human activity. The typical approach adopted is to
    make use of supervised learning. This involves the following three steps. The
    first step is to collect properly labeled sensor data for the various categories
    of interest (i.e. training). The second step involves identifying important features
    from this training data, which can uniquely identify each category (i.e. fingerprints).
    The final step is to choose an appropriate classification algorithm (e.g., support
    vector machines, neural networks, etc.), which can be used to achieve accurate
    classification. Preserving user privacy. Current participatory sensing applications
    are primarily focused on the collection of data on a large scale. Without any
    suitable protection mechanism however, the mobile phones are transformed into
    miniature spies, possibly revealing private information about their owners. Possible
    intrusions into a user''s privacy include the recording of intimate discussions,
    taking photographs of private scenes, or tracing a user''s path and monitoring
    the locations he has visited. Many users are aware of the possible consequences,
    and may therefore be reluctant to contribute to the sensing campaigns. Since participatory
    sensing exclusively depends on user-provided data, a high number of participants
    are required. The users'' reluctance to contribute would diminish the impact and
    relevance of sensing campaigns deployed at large scale, as well as limiting the
    benefits to the users. To encounter the risk that a user''s privacy might be compromised,
    mechanisms to preserve user privacy are mandatory. The authors in [308] present
    a comprehensive application independent architecture for anonymous tasking and
    reporting. The infrastructure enables applications to task a mobile device using
    a new tasking language, anonymously distribute tasks to mobile devices and collect
    anonymous yet verifiable reports from the devices. Evaluating trustworthiness
    of data. The success of participatory sensing applications hinges on high level
    of participation from voluntary users. Unfortunately, the very openness, which
    allows anyone to contribute data, also exposes the applications to erroneous and
    malicious contributions. For instance, users may inadvertently position their
    devices such that incorrect measurements are recorded, e.g., storing the phone
    in a bag while being tasked to acquire urban noise information. Malicious users
    may deliberately pollute sensor data for their own benefits, e.g., a leasing agent
    may intentionally contribute fabricated low noise readings to promote the properties
    in a particular suburb. Without confidence in the contributions uploaded by volunteers,
    the resulting summary statistics will be of little use to the user community.
    Thus, it is imperative that the application server can evaluate the trustworthiness
    of contributing devices so that corrupted and malicious contributions are identified.
    Recent work [309] proposes a novel reputation system that employs the Gompertz
    function for computing device reputation score as a reflection of the trustworthiness
    of the contributed data. Motivating participants. For a participatory sensing
    system to be a success, one of the key challenges is the recruitment of sufficient
    well-suited participants, those who are suitable for tasks that require domain-specific
    knowledge or expertise. Without adequate motivation, participants may not be willing
    enough to contribute, which in turn, reduces the data reliability. An effective
    approach to address this challenge and provide long-term participation is awarding
    incentives. Incentives can be broadly classified as intrinsic (such as users participating
    in a sensing campaign that will improve their community) or extrinsic (such as
    the system providing compensation for user participation) [310]. It is yet unclear
    which approach is best suited for participatory sensing. Conserving energy. Note
    that, the primary usage of mobile phones should be reserved for the users’ regular
    activities such as making calls, Internet access, etc. Users will only volunteer
    to contribute data if this process does not use up significant battery so as to
    prevent them from accessing their usual services. Even though, most users charge
    their phones on a daily basis, it is thus important that participatory sensing
    applications do not introduce significant energy costs for users. Energy is consumed
    in all aspects of participatory applications ranging from sensing, processing
    and data transmission. In particular, some sensors such as GPS consume significantly
    more energy than others. As such, it is important for participatory applications
    to make use of these sensors in a conservative manner. In [300], the authors present
    an adaptive scheme for obtaining phone location by switching between the accurate
    but energy-expensive GPS probing to energy-efficient but less accurate WiFi/cellular
    localization. Similar approaches can be employed for duty-cycling other energy-hungry
    sensors. 8. Summary and conclusions Multi-hop (mobile) wireless networking is
    a mature networking paradigm that provides well-known benefits such as network
    coverage enlargement, throughput increase by means of spatial reuse, and improved
    reliability through multi-path availability. In this article, we have reviewed
    the current status of the multi-hop (mobile) ad hoc networking research. We observed
    that after two decades of research activities the research on MANET protocols
    is now a cold research area. Then, after presenting the evolution of wireless
    technologies supporting multi-hop ad hoc networking, we have discussed the milestones
    and challenges in mesh, opportunistic, vehicular, and sensor networks. For each
    paradigm we have pointed out the research topics that we believe are worthy of
    further attention. We have also discussed the evolution of sensor networks towards
    the people-centric sensing paradigm. Thanks to the increasing diffusion of the
    smartphones, the people-centric paradigm combines wireless communications and
    sensor networks with the daily life and behaviors of people. The next step is
    to exploit the mobile phones and other personal devices to provide localized computing
    and communication services that are tightly coupled with people and their devices.
    Specifically, the mobile smart devices, by pooling their resources can start offer
    services as a mobile cloud bringing services and resources closer to where they
    are needed [4], [311], [312], thereby avoiding the energy and bandwidth costs
    associated with accessing the services in the cloud [313]. People-centric computing
    and communication paradigm highly depends on human mobility and social relationships.
    After extensive studies to characterize the properties of the human mobility and
    define mobility models, e.g., [66], [314], the research community is currently
    investigating the impact of people social behavior on people-centric paradigms,
    e.g., [315]. Indeed, mobile devices act as proxies of the humans in the cyber
    world and thus inherit the social links of their owners [316]. Therefore there
    is a growing interest in connecting the networking research with human-science
    research on human social network [317], [318]. It can be expected that, in the
    near future, the various ad hoc paradigms will be mixed together and/or integrated
    with infrastructure-based networks, thus generating novel networking paradigms
    merging the self-* features of multi-hop ad hoc networks with the reliability
    and robustness features of infrastructure based networks [4]. Examples of this
    trend are the hybrid cellular-opportunistic networks, which aim to mitigate the
    cellular data traffic problems by offloading some traffic by opportunistically
    exploiting the users’ devices (see Section 4), and the vehicular networks where
    opportunistic networking techniques are exploited to overcome the coverage limitations
    of roadside infrastructure-based networks (see Section 5). The mix of technologies/paradigms
    needs, first of all, solutions for supporting seamless mobility among a wide range
    of (mobile) access networks [319]. We conclude by observing that, several hot/emerging
    networking paradigms which are affecting infrastructure-based networks [320],
    such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)/cognitive radio networks [321], Information
    Centric Networking (ICN) [322], and Software Defined Networking (SDN) [323], are
    opening new research directions also in the mobile/multi-hop ad hoc network field,
    e.g., [324], [325], [326], [327], [328]. References [1] S. Basagni, M. Conti,

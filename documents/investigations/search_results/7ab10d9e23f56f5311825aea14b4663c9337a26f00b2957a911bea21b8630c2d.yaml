    is a revolutionary technology that represents the future of computing and communications.
    Most of the people over all worlds depend on agriculture. Because of this reason
    smart IT technologies are needed to migrate with traditional agriculture methods.
    Using modern technologies can control the cost, maintenance and monitoring performance.
    Satellite and aerial imagery play a vital role in modern agriculture. Precision
    agriculture sensor monitoring network is used greatly to measure agri-related
    information like temperature, humidity, soil PH, soil nutrition levels, water
    level etc. so, with IoT farmers can remotely monitor their crop and equipment
    by phones and computers. In this paper, we surveyed some typical applications
    of Agriculture IoT Sensor Monitoring Network technologies using Cloud computing
    as the backbone. This survey is used to understand the different technologies
    and to build sustainable smart agriculture. Simple IoT agriculture model is addressed
    with a wireless network. Published in: 2017 International conference on Microelectronic

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vellore, India SECTION I. Introduction Around
    60–70 %(predicted value) Indian population directly or indirectly depends on agriculture.
    That effects on food security and economic growth of India. With help of Precision,
    agriculture process can easily monitor or observe of crop growth based on collected
    information (soil condition and weather information) from a crop field. This mechanism
    also called as satellite farming or site-specific crop management (SSCM) [1],
    manually can''t able to collect environmental information because it is a tuff
    task. New farmers are coming out without knowledge of soil characteristics because
    insufficient soil testing labs properly not available in the states of the country.
    So now what is the importance of IoT in agriculture? The solution is Manual data
    collection; absolutely it is a risk for farmers and also to processes from the
    crop field. So it is difficult for farmers to get optimal levels of efficiency.
    To solve this difficulty, IoT (Internet of Things) is only the solution. It plays
    vital role in collecting information. IoT has been already in raising with novel
    multiple techniques. In this paper, a survey on smart agriculture IoT with cloud
    computing is carried out to understand the recent IoT -based technical developments
    in smart agriculture is explained in Section II, Section III describes a conceptual
    model for IoT and Wireless sensor network based agriculture with cloud computing,
    Section IV describes a hardware analysis of architecture, Section V describes
    a mathematical explanation, Section VI describes a future work. SECTION II. Litiracher
    Survey In papers [2]–[4] proposed an agricultural application of wireless sensor
    network for crop field monitoring. These systems fully equipped with two type
    sensor nodes to measure humidity, temperature, and an image sensing node to compare
    information by taking images of crops. Parameters play an important role for taking
    a good decision making for healthy crop within a time. The parameters are temperature,
    humidity, and images. By following these methods can achieve high stability of
    sensors with low consumption of power. With it''s a long period of monitoring
    the agriculture field area. Paper [5] proposed a greenhouse Monitoring System
    based on agriculture IoT with a cloud. In a greenhouse, management can monitor
    different environmental parameters effectively using sensor devices such as light
    sensor, temperature sensor, relative humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor.
    Periodically (30 seconds) the sensors are collecting information of agriculture
    field area and are being logged and stored online using cloud computing and Internet
    of Things. [6] Papers explain an IOT Based Crop-Field Monitoring and Irrigation
    Automation system. In their work, to monitor crop-field a system is developed
    by using sensors and according to the decision from a server based on sensed data,
    the irrigation system automated. By using wireless transmission the sensed data
    forwarded towards to web server database. If irrigation is automated then that
    means if the moisture and temperature fields fall below of the potential range.
    The user can monitor and control the system remotely with the help of application
    which provides a web interface to the user. In [7] proposed a smart drip irrigation
    system. In this, an Android mobile application is used to reduce the involvement
    of human and it used to control, monitor the crop area remotely. Water wastage
    can reduce with Drip Irrigation system and it works based on information from
    water level sensors. Some more different sensors are used to monitor the environmental
    conditions. [8] [9] [11] Proposed smart irrigation systems using Internet of Things.
    To calculate humidity and water levels of soil some wireless sensors are needed.
    These sensed data are sent to a smart gateway through a network, using a gateway
    called Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br 1000. From the gateway, the data
    is then sending to a web service through a network. [12] Conducted a survey on
    Smart Agriculture Irrigation systems to get better understand about the IoT -based
    development in agriculture with cloud computing. Figure (1): Tempareture and weather
    sensors Show All IoT -based smart agriculture system designed to perform various
    agricultural activities like weeding, spraying, moisture sensing, bird and animal
    scaring [13]. A GPS based robot has developed for this purpose. Here one intelligent
    decision making is proposed for smart control and irrigation system for monitoring
    agriculture area along with database management system [14]. To store the collected
    data here one database management is needed and it contains all soil information.
    Based on the temperature sensor values they have mainly focused on automatically
    controlling the water flow to the agricultural field. pre-prediction of rain can
    be done with the help of sensor to sense the weather condition, this will be intimated
    to farmer''s smartphone for his references through GSM. In wireless sensor networks
    automatically analyze sensed data from agriculture area field by using intelligent
    software application and this will take a decision, that is forwarded to the farmer
    for a healthy crop.[15] in this paper author Proposed a low maintenance and high
    gain Agriculture using novel Eco-friendly and Energy Efficient Sensor Technology.
    this paper clearly explains about automated farm monitoring and irrigation techniques
    which include wide range of sensors to remotely sense and monitor various parameters
    of the soil like temperature, moisture, and fertility and controls the supply
    of water and fertilizer to the land. [16] GSM Proposed a system for monitoring
    Pest Insect Traps Using Image Sensors & Aspic. GSM used distributed imaging devices
    which are operated through a wireless sensor network. GSM is used to acquire and
    transmit images of the trapping area to a remote host station. To the farmer''s
    mobile information regarding pest, accumulation is sent via call/message. This
    method only detects pests doesn''t suggest any method to control the pests. For
    controlling the deceases of crop one spray system is needed for pesticide utilization
    [17]. In Paper [18] Design and Development of Automatic Weed Detection and Smart
    Herbicide Sprayer Robot are presented. For identification of deceases in a crop
    can do with the help of an image processing algorithm. In which images are captured
    of a crop can be easy to identify the weeds of a crop as an interval manner. In
    paper [19] Proposed a Smart Beehive for Environmental, Agriculture, and Honey
    Bee Health Monitoring. Within and outside a living beehive for monitoring the
    multidimensional conditions such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, pollutant levels,
    temperature, and humidity paper [19] deployed a wide range of sensors. From the
    results obtained they have developed an algorithm for automatically determining
    the status of the bee colony. Based on Predicted Evapotranspiration a Green Roofs
    Smart Irrigation Controlling System is explained in [20]. For buildings, Green
    roofs are beneficial in a number of ways. Crops in green roofs are exposed to
    direct solar radiation and strong winds. This paper contains a new system Based
    on Predicted Evapotranspiration a Green Roofs for Smart Irrigation Controlling
    System. For deciding the amount of water to be irrigated this system is capable
    of predicting the evapotranspiration. A Sensor Network Data acquisition and Task
    Management for Decision Support of Smart Farming [21]. In order to perform necessary
    tasks required for farmers using Internet of Things (IoT), this paper presents
    a conceptual model and system design for decision support of smart farming with
    network sensor applications. A Smartphone Irrigation Sensor [22] is proposed.
    To use in agricultural crop field they designed and implemented an automated irrigation
    sensor with the utilization of Smartphone we can capture and according to with
    that digital images can able to find out and monitor the crop area and easy to
    measure water levels. Smart agriculture monitoring system used for controlling
    and can increase the yield production value [23]. Without the involvement of human
    they can identify rodents, deceases of crops and send update notification analysis
    information and processing is focused here. Using Python scripts sensors and electronic
    devices are integrated. Based on attempted test cases, they were able to achieve
    success in 84.8% test cases. An experiment for Implementation of IoT and Image
    Processing has been conducted. Smart Agriculture [24] describes an approach to
    combine IoT and image processing in order to determine the environmental factor
    or man-made factor (pesticides/fertilizers) which is specifically hindering the
    growth of the plant. Decision-making system used to take the better analyzed process
    from collected information of difficult environment system and the image of the
    leaf lattice; it is processed by MATLAB software by the help of histogram analysis.
    In paper [25], it facilitates Smart Sensors Based Monitoring System for Agriculture
    to arrive at conclusive results. for monitoring agricultural environment a new
    different technology is used. That acts as the gateway (FPGA) which comprises
    of the wireless protocol, different types of sensors such as temperature, soil
    moisture, and relative humidity sensors, microcontroller, serial protocol and
    the field programmable gate array with the display element. With the wireless
    Bluetooth module, the sensed data in an agricultural environment is provided into
    a microcontroller and interfaced. A wireless transmitter receiver module pair
    helps in transmitting and receiving the data which is then fed to FPGA using a
    serial communication protocol UART. To monitor the level of prelatic aquifers
    they have presented a smart, ultralow power, cheap and energy neutral system with
    Microbial Fuel Cells [26]. The Lora TM radio chip is used to transmit acquired
    data kilometers away also in a noisy environment keeping low the complexity of
    the network. By means of a terrestrial Microbial Fuel cell the device power supply
    is generated in an eco-friendly and zero emission manners. In paper [27] by using
    IoT technology the traditional methods are became Smart Agricultural Solutions
    to end users to get good yield. With the involvement of cloud computing and agriculture-IoT,
    the monitoring process became very fast and easy to maintain and helps to realize
    the smart solution for agriculture and efficiently solve the issues related to
    farmers. Agri-System is processed with input information''s, may be PH value calculation,
    humidity prediction and temperature of apiculture area field and Multiprocessing
    can be achieved with cloud computing intemet-of- Things (IoT), Sensors; Mobile-Computing
    & Big-Data Analysis [29] is used. Here, Soil and Environment properties are sensed
    and periodically and are sent to Agro Cloud through IoT (Beagle Black Bone). For
    fertilizer requirements, best crop sequences analysis, total production, and current
    stock and market requirements Big data analysis on Agro Cloud data is done. Proposed
    model is beneficial for an increase in agricultural production and for cost control
    of Agro-products. Automated Irrigation System is proposed with IOT sensors [30]:
    by using this method easy to maintain without an involvement of humans. The sensor
    senses the change in temperature and humidity whenever there is a change in temperature
    and humidity of the surroundings and gives an interrupt signal to the microcontroller.
    By reducing the power consumption Microcontroller in the system promises about
    an increase in systems life. For proper irrigation, this technique is used in
    Cricket stadiums or Golf stadiums and also in public garden area. SECTION III.
    Four Layers Iot-Agriculture Architecture A conceptual model for smart agriculture
    is proposed by analyzing the literature survey. Before that, let us know the overall
    structure of IOT. Constituting many physical devices in practice IOT basically
    has a three-layer structure. The first layer is the integrated application layers
    which in agriculture-related applications are operated because it is considered
    as user interface layer. It is user free and it includes farmer''s cell phones
    and personal devices are takes place to monitor the agriculture area. According
    to with this layer the farmers can take a decision to protect their crop as healthy
    and get better food production output. The second layer is information management
    layer which contains some responsibilities like formation and classification of
    data, creating, monitoring, decision making etc. These roles are maintained and
    performed in this layer. The third layer is network management layer which represents
    the communication technologies like Gateway, RFID, GSM, Wifi, 3G, UMTS, and Bluetooth
    Low Energy, Zigbee etc. The fourth layer is information collection layer which
    contains all types of sensors, cameras etc. These are used to collect information
    of crop for better and easy field monitoring of agriculture area. Figure 1 shows
    the four layer IoT structure. Figure (2): Layers of IoT architechture Show All
    In every method by default, a process is, several sensors are deployed in the
    crop field for measuring various parameters like temperature, humidity, soil PH,
    light intensity. Each device in the network will be assigned with an IP address
    for identification purpose. For example, the temperature sensor in the network
    will be addressed with object ID T1 within the communication Network. Addressing
    methods of IoT objects include IPV6 and IPv4. Identification methods are used
    to provide a clear identity for each object within the network., IoT sensors can
    be smart sensors, actuators or wearable sensing devices. The sensed data''s from
    crop field are sent to a cloud through a gateway which is connected to the internet
    via Wifi or any other communication network. From the cloud, the data''s are sent
    to farmer''s smartphones or computers. By analyzing this data farmers can take
    appropriate decision. SECTION IV. Analysis and Comparision of IoT Hardware Requriement
    Device: An IOT system uses devices which provide sensing, actuation, control,
    and monitoring activities. Based on temporal and space constraints (i.e. memory,
    processing capabilities, communication latencies, and speeds, and deadlines IOT
    devices can exchange data with other connected devices and application, or collect
    data from other devices and that collected data sends to base station server and
    from it to cloud server by using gateway or perform some tasks locally and other
    tasks within IOT Infrastructure). An IOT device may consist of several interfaces
    for communications to other devices, both wired and wireless. These include (i)
    I/O interfaces for sensors, (ii) interfaces for Internet connectivity, (iii) memory
    and storage interfaces, and (iv) audio/video interface. Communication: communication
    between devices and remote servers is done by the communication block. Data link
    layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layers generally work with
    IOT communication protocols. Table (1): Comparisons of wireless communications
    Services: Functions such as device modeling, device control, data publishing,
    data analytics, and device discovery can be done by IOT system. Management: Different
    functions like to govern an IOT system& to seek the underlying governance of IOT
    system can be done by management block. Security: providing functions such as
    authentication, authorization, privacy, message integrity, content integrity,
    and data security can be done by security block. Security block also secures IOT
    system. Application: For users, the Application layer is the most important layer.
    This layer provides necessary modules to control, and monitor various aspects
    of the IOT system. Applications allow users to visualize and analyze the system
    status at present stage of action, sometimes prediction of futuristic prospects.
    Some of the wireless sensors are listed out below and explained briefly i. 802.11-
    Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 is a collection of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication
    standards. For example, 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz band, 802.11b and 802.11
    g operate in the 2.4 GHz band, 802.11n operates in the 2.4/5 GHz bands, 802.11ac
    operates in the 5 GHz band and 802.11 ad operates in the 60 GHz band. These standards
    provide data rates from 1 Mb/s to 6.75 GB/s. the communication range of Wi-Fi
    is in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100 m (outdoor). Table (2): Comparison of
    the IOT cloud platforms may be used for agricultural domains: A case study i.
    802.16- WiMax IEEE 802.16 is a collection of wireless broadband standards. Data
    rates from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 GB/s provided by WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for
    Microwave Access) standards. Data rate of 100 Mb/s for mobile stations and 1 GB/s
    for fixed stations is provided by (802.16 m). On the IEEE 802.16 working group
    website (IEEE 802.16, 2014) specifications are readily available. iii. 802.15.4-LR-WPAN
    IEEE 802.15.4 is a collection of Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN)
    standards. High level communications protocols such as ZigBee are formed by 802.15.4.
    Data rates from 40 Kb/s to 250 Kb/s are provided by LR-WPAN. Low cost and low-speed
    communication to power constrained devices is provided by LR - WPAN. The low frequency
    data rate of LR-WPAN is 868/915 MHz and the high data rate frequency of LR-WPAN
    is 2.4 GHz. iv. 802.15.1-Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1 is the Bluetooth standard. For
    a short range (8-10m) data transmission between mobile devices is provided by
    Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a low power, low cost wireless communication technology.
    The Bluetooth standard defines a personal area network (PAN) communication. It
    operates in 2.4 GHz band. Bluetooth data rate ranges from 1 Mb/s to 24 Mb/s. Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE or Bluetooth Smart) is the ultra low power, low cost version of
    Bluetooth. BLE was merged with Bluetooth standard v4.0 in 2010. 1.5.6. Lora WAN
    R1.0 The LoraTM Alliance which is an open and non-profit association recently
    developed long range communication protocol called Low Power Wide Area Networks
    (LPWAN) standard protocol to enable IOT. The main aim of this protocol is interoperability
    between various operators in one open global standard. LoRaWAN data rates range
    from 0.3 kb/s to 50 kb/s. LoRa operates in 868 and 900 MHz ISM bands. LoRa communicates
    between the connected nodes within 20 miles range, in unobstructed environments
    according to post capes. Battery life for the attached node is normally very long,
    up to 10 years. SECTION V. Matmatical Explanetion for High Yield Process Most
    of the mathematical explanations are carried out for better yield production.
    For instance, rice and wheat formula is Yield =no. plants/m2×no. of effective
    fillers/plants× no.of grains/piants×%of filled grains × test weight/100× 10,000/1000.
    View Source Where yield analysis is done with two parameters. The relation between
    Biological yield and economic yield is Biological yield ×K=economic yield View
    Source A crop which produced a dry matter is called Biological yield and a fraction
    of biological yield which is used by man is called economic yield. In order to
    get high production yield, two important parameters are involved. Temperature
    and soil moisture. The temperature and soil moisture must within 18-25’ c and
    15-60% respectively. Y=T×M×A×100 View Source T= temperature optimal range 18-25°
    c M= soil moisture optimal range 15-60% A= area of crop field This equation is
    used to finalize the yield of the crop field. When these values are increased
    or decreased (violating the optimal range) means, there is a chance of minimal
    production yield. It seems must be within optimal range only. SECTION VI. Future
    Work A large research effort is still required although the architectures described
    in earlier section make IOT concept practically feasible. Technical problems associated
    with current IOT architectures are reviewed in this section. To meet all necessary
    parts that are missing in existing architecture, later on, a novel concept of
    IOT architecture was developed. Before the IOT will be widely accepted and deployed
    in all the domains, a sufficient understanding of industrial characteristics and
    requirements on factors such as cost, security, privacy, and risk has to be discussed.
    Let us discuss a few problems in this regard: Maintaining cost- is a more important
    parameter in case of farmers. So on order to reach this point, researcher concentrate
    on developing new smart agriculture IoT architecture with added advantages. Current
    database management system may not handle in a real-time manner because the originated
    data may be too much large in size. Proper solutions need to be idealized. In
    a rapid speed, IOT based data would be generated. Current RAID technology is incapable
    of handling the collected data at receivers end. To handle this problem IOT based
    data service-centric architecture need to be revised. Data is a raw fact that
    generally does not conform to non-relevant handouts. Data play the massive role
    in decision making in IOT. The value of data is the pool of data. By orientation
    of mining, analysis, and understanding meaningful information of data can only
    be obtained. For handling similar regression Big data problem is sufficient. Data
    mining, analytics, and hence decision-making services can be done by a relevant
    architectural framework. With data mining analytics Big Data approach could be
    aggregated. The design of Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) for IOT is a big
    challenge where service-based objects may face problems from performance and cost
    related issues. To handle a large number of devices connected to the system which
    phrases scalability issues, SOA needed. Challenges like: data transfer, processing,
    and management become a matter of burden over headed by service provisioning.
    The quality of service is also a big issue. To achieve an optimal range of QoS,
    a developer needs to concentrate on parameters of QoS. An incredibly high number
    of nodes are envisaged with IOT. All the attached devices and data shall be retrievable.
    For efficient point-to-point network configuration, unique identity is the must.
    IPv4 protocol identifies each node through a 4-byte address. The availability
    of IPv4 numbered addresses is decreasing rapidly by reaching zero in next few
    years, so new addressing policy named IPv6 is developed. to pursue device naming
    and identification capability IPv6 area is the area where utmost care is needed
    and appropriateness of architectural proficiency is a must.. SECTION VII. Conclusion
    precision agriculture can be made more accurate and efficient with IOT enabled
    technologies. IOT can be applied in different domains of agriculture First one
    is the Water and Energy: for Agriculture, Water and energy are the most important
    inputs and their costs can improve or break the agricultural business. Due to
    leaky irrigation systems, inefficient field application methods and the planting
    of water-intensive crops in the wrong growing location water wastage is done.
    For its operation Pumps, boosters, lighting etc need electrical energy. water
    use can be made smarter for agriculture by monitoring and change water volume,
    location timing and duration of flow can be done with IOT. With the help of IOT,
    use of effective energy for pumps, boosters, lighting and other purposes also
    done the second one is the crop monitoring: the major concerns in this area are
    an application of fertilizers, pesticides based on crop and soil health, pest
    control. By deploying sensors and image capturing devices in the crop field which
    is connected to the internet for an appropriate decision can be taken with IOT.
    Efficient use of fertilizers and pesticides can be made with IOT. Finally conclude
    that need to develop on optimal Agri-IoT architecture which is enclosed with low
    cost, low power consumption of devices, better decision making process, QoS service,
    optimal performance and it is easy to understand the farmer without knowledge.

    Metrics Abstract: This article provides a survey on the adoption of LoRa in the
    agricultural field and reviews state-of-the-art solutions for smart agriculture,
    analyzing the potential of this technology in different infield applications.
    In particular, we consider four reference scenarios, namely, irrigation systems,
    plantation and crop monitoring, tree monitoring, and livestock monitoring, which
    exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, density, sensors’
    complexity, and energy demand, as well as latency in the decision process. We
    discuss how LoRa-based solutions can work in these scenarios, analyzing their
    scalability, interoperability, network architecture, and energy efficiency. Finally,
    we present possible future research directions and point out some open issues
    which might become the main research trends for the next years. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the
    agricultural sector is called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly
    scarce resources, extreme weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction
    in arable land [1]. Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population
    will reach about 10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to
    produce 70% more food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from
    the old farming concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information
    and communications technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and
    optimize their operations more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural
    production can be improved: from soil management to minimizing water consumption,
    from plant protection to animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices
    located infields are able to collect information and control the evolution of
    the different processes at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization
    of electronic components allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor
    and energy consumption, monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations,
    crop growth, and solar exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought,
    hail, or flooding. IoT systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into
    useful statistics: for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the
    strictly necessary resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where
    there is a real need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick
    plants, etc. [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart
    agriculture systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization
    of agriculture is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas.
    In the literature, several communication protocols have been proposed, with different
    characteristics related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability
    [9]. Among the available technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power
    consumption and coverage range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened
    in a dashed box in Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture
    requirements. One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers
    wide network coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption
    during operation [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power
    consumption versus communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open
    system based on a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several
    interesting features for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such
    reasons, LoRa has been widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting
    environmental sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control
    different kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such
    as tractor communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13],
    [14]. Differently from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with
    all other IoT solutions or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider
    the adoption of these systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa
    is cited in [5] in the general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most
    promising technologies for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by
    [8] which dedicated a Section to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies;
    similarly [15] includes LoRa in IoT communication protocols suitable for smart
    agriculture. On the other hand, [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on
    the protocol performance, [13] takes into consideration only the energy consumption
    of LoRa, [17] discusses the application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in
    the context of smart agriculture. Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues
    meaning the decision support system (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively.
    Instead, in this article, we strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis
    on LoRa/LoRaWAN application in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view
    of the advancements and in-field applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN
    relies on LoRa modulation, a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by
    Semtech [20]. It supports wireless connectivity with limited data rates over large
    areas and without the need of an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry,
    smart home, smart city and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment.
    In the view of the authors of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths
    (low-cost, long-range, low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can
    bridge the gap between smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover,
    several recent improvements on the resource allocation, channel access protocol,
    and network planning can enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing
    capital and operational costs [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated
    good coverage of LoRa [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have
    been obtained in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation
    conditions, respectively. In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage
    range can be increased by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In
    terms of power consumption, LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its
    devices. The low power consumption is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal
    choice for smart agriculture applications. It was demonstrated experimentally
    that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa device may be six times that of
    a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee device [26]. In this article, we
    provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture systems, analyzing the
    state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the possible adoption of Machine
    Learning, control automation techniques, and energy autonomy features. We classify
    these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation systems; 2) plantation and
    crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring. These LoRa systems
    are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability, network architecture,
    energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which traverse most of the current
    smart agriculture systems. References have been selected based on recent papers
    dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions in different fields
    useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present the lessons learned
    and draw future research directions which we think crucial for the success and
    widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article is structured as
    follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and its perspectives
    in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart agriculture
    applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general purpose
    LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead, discusses
    specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the four above-mentioned
    categories. Lessons learned and future research directions are proposed in Section
    VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION II. LoRa and Its Perspectives
    in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary physical layer technology patented
    by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising solution for large-scale low-power
    IoT deployments, including smart agriculture applications. Indeed, by operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands and with
    a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa provides a cheap solution for supporting
    wireless connectivity with limited data rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas
    and without the need of an operator. Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated
    by having a maximum transmission power of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable
    bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500 kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which
    permit low energy consumption. In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices
    can last up to 15 years. Although LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer,
    different network solutions can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission
    interfaces. Among these, the most consolidated one is the open-source solution
    promoted by the LoRa Alliance, which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks
    are based on a simple star of star topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such
    as sensors or actuators deployed infield, transmit packets on the wireless medium
    to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs), which, in turn, forward the collected packets
    to a central network server (NS) interacting with several application servers
    (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based
    on a wired Internet technology, while EDs are not associated to a specific GW,
    which greatly simplifies implementation (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case
    a duplicate packet is simultaneously received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible
    of filtering these packets and performs other simple decisions on network configuration.
    Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity
    and the energy consumption, LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines
    three classes of devices (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of
    managing the reception operations performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding
    to the lowest energy profile, can receive downlink packets only in two time windows
    following the transmission of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices
    can sleep all the time and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an
    uplink one. Class B devices add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception
    windows, by keeping a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices
    are constantly listening to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a
    new packet is ready for transmission, devices attempt to transmit by randomly
    selecting one of the available channels in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz
    there are 16 channels in Europe), together with a modulation parameter called
    spreading factor (SF). More into details, six different SFs are used in LoRa (from
    SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol times and in almost orthogonal
    transmissions: when two signals modulated at different SFs overlap, the GW is
    able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power ratios among the signals
    [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN specification offers dedicated
    end-to-end encryption to application providers, together with network-level security
    primitives, which allow sharing the same network among multitenant applications
    [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack. Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment
    with excellent coverage, the availability of devices with very low energy demand,
    and intrinsic security mechanisms make these systems very suitable for innovative
    agriculture applications. Indeed, several state-of-the-art IoT applications in
    smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. For example, LoRa is used
    to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental parameters or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for irrigation purposes), and in applications
    such as livestock monitoring and location tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications
    are not critical for data rates and latency, but often require to work in large
    rural areas, with limited access to energy grids and the Internet, and with decision
    mechanisms which benefit from data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture
    Applications and Challenges While industrial production processes have already
    become smarter and autonomous thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry
    4.0 concept, the integration of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence
    (AI), robotics, and big data is more recent in agriculture. The availability of
    IoT technologies for supporting wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling
    infields smart objects shows a great potential for improving the agricultural
    sector, toward the so called smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm
    monitoring and automation can make production more efficient and sustainable [7],
    by promptly detecting and reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw
    materials, crops’ diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems
    related to the wellbeing of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart
    agriculture applications has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization
    of agricultural sensors and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for
    reducing the intense physical labor traditionally required in agriculture [15].
    Apart from the availability of smart devices for interacting with the farm in
    the physical world, smart agriculture applications require to build a digital
    representation of the farm status and a decision logic based on the collected
    data. Different protocols can be envisioned both for providing the wireless connectivity
    to heterogeneous devices (from simple low-cost temperature sensors, to complex
    remote-controlled robots) and exporting data for analysis and decisions [32],
    [33]. Since a large amount of data can be produced by agricultural sensors, big
    data analysis can provide efficient monitoring and processing methods [34]. Data
    processing may involve various features such as data loading, validation, aggregation,
    prediction, classification, image or video processing, and data mining. Thus,
    based on the acquired data, DSSs can optimize the productivity and reduce the
    ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers recognize that digitization of farming
    processes and activities is an important challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture
    technologies [32], [35]. In particular, the major challenges to digitization in
    agriculture can be categorized as follows. Communication Issues: As we will detail
    later, large-scale implementations of IoT solutions require robust and secure
    network architectures. The reliability of communicating information still represents
    a challenge to be addressed in the agricultural context and justifies the adoption
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies. Energy Management: The power supply in devices for
    smart agriculture is a significant challenge and energy harvesting systems are
    a relevant area of research. The main issue concerns the sensor’s power supply
    and how to optimize efficiently the power consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes
    can execute some computations (Edge computing) which consumes more energy, while
    sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently, smart devices require
    efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity: In general, the
    agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors, weather
    sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices generally
    use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to sensors heterogeneity,
    network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered as well. Getting these
    technologies to work together is often an issue, especially for unskilled farmers.
    Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on farms proves to be a significant
    challenge, especially when the entire farm needs to be monitored across a large
    area and with different application scenarios (soil, plants, trees, animals, etc.).
    Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting the data can be a huge barrier:
    indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big data analysis could be required
    to better understand and forecast the unpredictability of agricultural ecosystems.
    Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart agriculture technologies is
    often required to develop user friendly software platforms. The challenge here
    is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified to support different
    types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock. These challenges,
    together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity of technologies,
    lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and privacy and security
    concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative platforms,
    specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture [32],
    [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

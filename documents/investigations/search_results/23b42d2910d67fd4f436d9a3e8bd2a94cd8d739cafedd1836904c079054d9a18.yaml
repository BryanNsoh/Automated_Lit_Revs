    content Abstract This work presents the main methodological aspects and results
    obtained from the activity of the Irrigation Advisory Service for Farmers (SIAR)
    of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. Castilla-La Mancha is a broad semi-arid region,
    with a total area of 8 million ha and an irrigable area of more an 475,000 ha.
    Most of these irrigated areas (at least 60%) present serious problems of water
    scarcity, and are in need of improvement in the use of irrigation water. SIAR
    upgrades farmers’ capacities and awareness, thus minimizing the negative environmental
    impacts of irrigation, decreasing the production costs and contributing to the
    sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the area. Approximately, 25% of the
    irrigated area is advised, representing 499 collaborator farmers within an area
    of ca. 100,000 ha. Water-scarce areas are where the SIAR advice is more closely
    followed by the farmers and irrigation performance indicators are highest. The
    total estimated cost for the service is of about €3 ha−1 yr−1. A team of field
    technicians forms the core of SIAR. The team is assembled via a cooperation agreement
    between the University of Castilla-La Mancha and the Regional Government. Among
    the results and conclusions obtained, the most important is the improvement of
    water use. However, technical, social and economic limitations are relevant, and
    constitute a handicap to achieve the objectives of the advisory service. Previous

    One of the greatest challenges for the coming decades will be to increase food
    production with less water, particularly in countries with limited water and land
    resources. The sustainable use of water for agriculture has become a global priority
    of vital importance, requiring urgent and immediate solutions in view of intensifying
    worldwide competitiveness (FAO, 2002). The problem is not only to develop more
    refined techniques and practices to apply water accurately to the crop according
    to its requirements. There still exists a large gap between the availability of
    technologies for effective water use and their adoption. One of the reasons is
    that relatively little attention has been paid to establish an effective support
    system to assist farmers in the adoption of new techniques and technologies. As
    a result, the impact of the investments in many irrigation projects is considerable
    lower than expected in terms of production, water conservation, and sustainability
    (both economical and environmental). Irrigation advisory services can play an
    important role in assisting users to adopt new techniques and technologies and
    to increase productivity (economic or social), minimizing environmental risks
    and contributing to the sustainability of the agrarian sector (Smith and Muñoz,
    2002). Such services can be provided by private companies, public or co-operative
    agencies. Financial sustainability is the critical point in the promotion of irrigation
    advisory services. Many universities and research institutes, and some private
    consultants too, have been involved in the development of several models and offered
    services for advisory services to farmers. These irrigation advisory services
    have been more developed in the arid areas, with limitations of amount or quality
    of water or when the water price is high (Smith and Muñoz, 2002, English, 2002).
    One of the better well-known and pioneering Irrigation Advisory Services is the
    one in California (USA). The arid conditions of California combined with a highly
    productive agricultural sector and a dense population with outspoken environmental
    concerns have made California one of the states in the USA with the most stringent
    regulatory framework of water resources (Smith and Muñoz, 2002, Eching, 2002).
    To respond to demands for water conservation and water quality control, a range
    of initiatives have been taken to promote more effective water use. In the early
    eighties, the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) was
    established with a main objective: to provide the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) as a basis for the irrigation scheduling. CIMIS also provides information
    related to irrigation in particular and agricultural practices in general (CIMIS,
    2004). CIMIS was developed as a joint project between the California Department
    of Water Resources (CDWR) and the University of California. CIMIS has developed
    a great activity, having one of the most complete networks of automated climatic
    stations of the USA to determinate the ETo, the crop coefficients, and to provide
    irrigation scheduling, disseminating this information to the users. At present,
    new technologies are used (remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS),
    Internet, etc.) to continue providing accurate and timely information to the farmers
    (Eching, 2002). CIMIS has been the model for the development of other Irrigation
    Advisory Services, although adapted to the particularities of each situation (social,
    economic, environmental, etc.). In addition to CIMIS, other Irrigation Advisory
    Services have been developed in USA, e.g. University of Florida, University of
    Georgia, Texas Cooperative Extension, Utah State University Extension, University
    of Minnesota (Smith and Muñoz, 2002). Other examples are the Rural Water Use Efficiency
    Initiative in Australia and in Europe, services acting in the United Kingdom and
    in Italy (Hess and Knox, 2002, Giannini and Bagnoni, 2002). They are quite common
    in Spain, such as the services in Murcia, Navarra, and Castilla-La Mancha, which
    are currently under operation, and new ones are taking the first steps in other
    Spanish regions. Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) is a wide semi-arid region of southeastern
    Spain with an irrigated area of more than 475,000 ha distributed all over the
    region (Fig. 1). The irrigated area represents 11.2% of its agricultural land
    but it provides more than 40% of the final agricultural production of the region
    (JCCM, 2003, Álvarez and Matamala, 2004). In these irrigated lands, as in many
    other semi-arid territories all over the world, water limitations are increasingly
    common: 60% of the irrigated land in Castilla-La Mancha is under-supplied and
    65% uses underground resources (PNR, 2002). At present, two large aquifers are
    declared overexploited (Aquifers 23 and 24, Hydrogeological Units 04.04 and 04.06,
    respectively). These figures express the need to make good use of water through
    adequate irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation systems (adequately managed
    and designed). Additionally, crops with low water requirements, high added value
    and water productivity should be introduced. In addition to the serious problems
    of water scarcity, there is an increment of non-point source pollution of the
    hydrogeological units of the region. For example in Aquifer 24, more than 70%
    of the samples have a concentration of nitrates higher than 50 mg l−1. Download

    regional distribution of irrigation: irrigated lands, overexploited aquifers and
    weather stations of SIAR. Under these conditions, it is thus necessary to develop
    advice and support services for helping farmers in decision-making. In June 1999,
    following its policy for sustainable agriculture, the Regional Department of Agriculture
    in collaboration with the Regional Water Research Centre (CREA) established the
    regional Irrigation Advisory Service for Farmers (Servicio Integral de Asesoramiento
    al Regante, SIAR). The purpose of this paper is to disseminate SIAR''s activities,
    especially the experience gained from working in a large semi-arid zone where
    two situations coexist: irrigated lands with a serious water shortage and high
    water prices on the one hand, and lands with an adequate volume at a normal cost
    on the other. The most recent aspects of the advisory service will also be emphasized:
    economically optimum irrigation water depth, integration of the evaluation of
    irrigation systems, etc. The overall SIAR objective is to help farmers to achieve
    an efficient use of their production factors, especially of water, fertilizers
    and energy. Adequate scientific and technical support is provided to farmers in
    order to optimize its management, making agriculture a sustainable activity, compatible
    with the environment. For the success of the SIAR, or any other Advisory Service
    (e.g. CIMIS), it is necessary to offer the information and tools, which are useful
    to the farmers and the society as a whole (environmental benefit, nourishing security,
    etc.). The main reasons for the interest in SIAR are the benefits of the reduction
    in applied water and yield increases. This idea agrees with the results of the
    CIMIS (Eching, 2002). 2. The Irrigation Advisory Service, description and operation
    Taking as a basis multifunctional agriculture, integrated in its context (economic,
    social, environmental and landscape), SIAR acts in coordination with the farmers,
    having them participating in the solutions offered and providing useful feed-back.
    On the other hand, SIAR contributes as much as possible to farmers’ capacity building,
    so that they develop the tools required to take business-oriented decisions in
    the management of their farms. This initiative aims channelling technology to
    irrigated agriculture, bearing in mind the relevance of local experience, and
    considering also the frequent divergence between research results and farmers’
    practices. SIAR is coordinated by the Regional Water Research Centre (CREA) of
    the University of Castilla-La Mancha and directed by the Regional Department of
    Agriculture, which is in charge of the general guidelines, promoting contact with
    farmers and providing the basic meteorological data from 43 weather stations distributed
    throughout the region (Fig. 1). These are automatic weather stations with the
    records centralized by a mobile phone network in a computer server. The following
    meteorological variables are currently recorded: temperature, relative humidity,
    total solar radiation, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Some of SIAR''s
    key activities for achieving an efficient and economic use of irrigation water
    (English et al., 1990, Ortega et al., 1997, Tarjuelo and de Juan, 1999, English,
    2002, Ortega et al., 2004a) are as follows: • Irrigation scheduling. The timing
    and volume of irrigation must be specified according to standard scheduling criteria.
    SIAR works with the main crops of each area, including field crops (barley, wheat,
    maize, alfalfa, sugar beet), which occupy a large area and use a large share of
    the water resources; horticultural crops (garlic, onion, potato, pepper, melon)
    having a large social and economic relevance; and finally vines and fruit trees
    (olive, apricot) normally showing low water requirements but playing an important
    social and economic role. • Distribution network and on-farm irrigation systems.
    Both levels must be correctly designed, maintained and managed to achieve high-irrigation
    performance. The distribution network must ensure that the required flows are
    available timely, according to the crop water requirements for any type of water
    delivery scheme. When dealing with farm irrigation systems, water must be applied
    with high uniformity and efficiency, while evaluation is necessary in order to
    identify possible problems. Likewise, it is necessary to advice farmers concerning
    management so that efficiency parameters can be improved (e.g. determining the
    time of sprinkler irrigation in order to decrease drift and evaporation losses).
    • Crop rotations to maximize the gross margin. Since agriculture is an economic
    activity, it is important to maximize water profitability. Thus, the search for
    profitable crops must be a recurrent activity for farmers and advisory services.
    Water management plans must include deficit irrigation strategies searching maximum
    gross margin instead of maximum yield. For a number of local crops, applying the
    water requirements for maximum production does not lead to maximum economic profitability
    (Ortega et al., 2004a). Likewise, it is also important to assess the optimization
    of production techniques that are more closely linked to water use (e.g. fertilization
    scheduling), thus obtaining lower costs and environmental improvement of the irrigated
    land. In addition to the transfer of information, the formative tasks that SIAR
    should carry out are also of importance. These aspects are fundamental to the
    sustainability of irrigated lands in areas, such as Castilla-La Mancha, even when
    other political, administrative, and legal action can be of influence. In this
    scenario, the economic and social optimization of the available water is a high-priority
    objective, which must be integrated into the Advisory Services. The economic efficiency
    of water use must be included in the decision-making process, opening new strategies
    for water management (Ortega et al., 2004b). Fig. 2 shows the general operation
    of SIAR based on climatic data, growth stage and development of crops along with
    the economic optimization of water use. This will lead to either a personalization
    or generalization of irrigation requirements. The information is conveyed by means
    of several different media (Internet, reports, etc.). In SIAR, irrigation system
    evaluation is essential, and its results are used to prepare performance improvement
    strategies and to elaborate personalized irrigation recommendations. Download

    is available (agricultural engineers, hydrogeologists, electronic engineers, computer
    specialists, and economists). Together with the researchers, a field engineer''s
    team is in charge of collecting field data, providing information to farmers,
    and performing irrigation system evaluations. The areas where SIAR operates are
    presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 3. All of them count on an automated weather station.

    systems in the region. These areas are strategically distributed to achieve a

    areas of SIAR are water-scarce, except for those in Toledo and Guadalajara. Download

    2.1. Irrigation scheduling The methodology used to determine the irrigation requirements
    and irrigation scheduling is based on the FAO guidelines, taking into account
    the simplified daily water balance in the soil–plant–atmosphere set (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1992, Allen et al., 1998, Pereira and Allen, 1999). The estimation
    procedure begins with the determination of reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
    and ends with the water balance, considering soil water content, the irrigation
    timing and the resulting gross irrigation depth. ETo is calculated using the Penman–Monteith
    method (Pereira and Allen, 1999). This methodology, generally accepted in the
    literature for semi-arid areas, has been validated for local conditions by means
    of measurements in weighting lysimeters (López Urrea, 2004). The automated weather
    station network used (Fig. 1) has the main sensors to calculate the ETo by means
    of that method. The crop ET (ETm) for the different crops in each one of the pilot
    areas is determined from the crop coefficient (Kc) curve, and is established based
    on the literature and experience in the area (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1992, Martín
    de Santa Olalla et al., 1992, Martín de Santa Olalla et al., 1994, Allen et al.,
    1998, Fabeiro et al., 2001, Ortega et al., 2004c). Many factors are involved in
    irrigation management, including water availability, product prices and market
    uncertainties, plus the constraints imposed by agrarian policies. All these factors
    should be considered when designing an irrigation schedule. SIAR uses the MOPECO
    decision-making tool (Ortega et al., 2004a) to assist farmers in the development
    of irrigation strategies, while also determining correct depths of applied water
    in order to economically optimize water use. Conventional irrigation management
    strategies are usually planned without deficit irrigation, even though the economical
    optimum will imply some degree of under-irrigation, depending on the crop, its
    water requirements and gross margin (Tarjuelo and de Juan, 1999, Ortega et al.,
    2004a). The MOPECO model is composed by three computing modules (Ortega et al.,
    2004a): Module I determines seasonal net irrigation depths (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1992, Pereira and Allen, 1999). Module II employs a normal statistical distribution
    to simulate water distribution for the irrigation system based on the Christiansen''s
    Uniformity Coefficient (CU). By considering the crop yield and economic data,
    the gross margin is related to the irrigation depth for each crop. The functions
    of the second computing module are the following: • A normal statistical distribution
    function representing the water applied by the irrigation system (Keller and Bliesner,
    1990, Anyoji and Wu, 1994). This function simulates crop yields for different
    CU values when it is integrated into a production function. • Yields and crop
    prices are used to estimate the farmer''s gross revenue. • A cost function is
    developed to quantify the global production costs for different crops. Cropping
    costs linked to yield (e.g. seeding rates, fertilizer use and harvest costs) and
    therefore, indirectly linked to applied water, are treated as a function of yield.
    The model starts with the production function of Stewart et al. (1977), which
    estimates the crop yield based on the relation of actual to maximum evapotranspiration.
    (1) where Ya is the real harvested yield (kg ha−1), Ym the agronomic maximum yield
    that can be achieved in a given area when crop development is not limited by water
    availability or other factors (kg ha−1), ky the proportionality factor, which
    shows the sensitivity of the crop to water stress, ETa the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), ETm the crop evapotranspiration for maximum yield (mm), and i represents
    the developmental stages of the crop. ETa is estimated according to Doorenbos
    and Kassam (1979) model. ETa is, therefore, determined on a daily basis with the
    following model for each one of the management strategies studied: (2) (3) where
    Wt is water stored in the soil at time t (mm), p the depletion level of soil water
    for the crop at the point when ET begins to decline from the potential rate (decimal),
    DM the soil management deficit at moment t (decimal), TAW the total available
    soil water (mm cm−1), and Zr the crop''s root depth (cm). The deficit coefficient
    in the root zone (Cd), based on the quantity of water in the irrigated field,
    is integrated (by means of its effects on actual evapotranspiration, ETa) into
    the production function as follows: (4) where Cdmi is the mean deficit coefficient
    for each growth and development stage (i) and (1−α)i the ET fraction for each
    of the growth and development stages of a crop whose requirements are met through
    the irrigation water applied (the rest is supplied by the effective rainfall and
    the variation of the water stored in the soil). Global production costs include
    all the costs associated with the agricultural production process, except the
    fixed or structural costs and those relative to irrigation water application.
    The global production costs include the following (de Juan et al., 2003): • Direct
    costs: production costs (fertilizers, seeds, treatments, utilization of machinery,
    insurances, and lease). • Financial costs: the cost of money invested temporarily
    in each agricultural production campaign. To determine crop costs, questionnaires
    and personal interviews were given to farmers. These studies reflect, chronologically,
    the farm work and operations with a definite target yield along with the most
    important technical information about the operations carried out (machinery, labour,
    performance, running time, time efficiency, etc.). This information, therefore,
    permits to quantify the inputs and outputs of the production process. Finally,
    by analyzing the different yield objectives, the costs are modelled as a function
    of the crop yield. The gross margin is obtained from the commercial products plus
    the possible subsidies minus the production costs: (5) where GM is the gross margin
    (€ ha−1), Y the real harvested yield (kg ha−1), Pp the price of the product (€
    kg−1), Ysp the commercial by-product yield, if present, is estimated as a relation
    between Y/Ysp (kg ha−1), Psp the price of the by-product (€ kg−1), CP stands for
    payments from the compensatory subsidy for some crops (€ ha−1) in Europe by Common
    Agricultural Policy (CAP), PC the global production costs for actual yield (€
    ha−1), Cw the cost of irrigation water application (€ m−3), and Dg the gross depth
    applied by the system (m3 ha−1). The model allows us to determine the relation
    between the gross margin and the gross irrigation depth. Normally, the authors
    work with the water application cost, CU and water cost scenarios for each irrigated
    area. The relation between the gross margin and the gross irrigation depth (Eq.
    (5)) allows us to analyze the water irrigation depth that maximizes the gross
    margin (optimum water depth). When planning strategies for the economic optimization
    of irrigation water, different gross irrigation depths must be considered. Therefore,
    the results of the MOPECO Module II are very useful for economic analysis of the
    irrigation strategies in the different pilot areas, establishing the economic
    optimum for each scenario. This irrigation strategy, associated with a different
    deficit for each crop (objective relationship ETa/ETm) will be recommended for
    each experimental area by means of the objective of the adjusted evapotranspiration
    of the crop (ETc adj) and according to the simulated ETa. The ETc adj is estimated
    by using a multiplication factor that involves the effect of soil water stress
    on the crop ET (Ks) (Eq. (6)) (Allen et al., 1998). This is simulated by MOPECO
    and obtained as the relation between the objective of ETa and ETm. (6) It is also
    possible to study the economic efficiency of irrigation water use (EE), defined
    as a parameter which indicates the relation between gross margin and water resources
    discharged by the irrigation system (Eq. (7)) (ASAE S526.2, 2004, Ortega et al.,
    2004b). (7) € Module III identifies cropping patterns (crop rotation) and irrigation
    strategies that maximize total profits at the farm level using genetic algorithms.
    This module uses the relation between gross margin and the irrigation depth for
    an individual crop to optimize crop rotation on the whole farm. Crop rotation
    must satisfy certain restrictions: (a) available area on the farm, (b) maximum
    or minimum area for the different crops considered, (c) availability of irrigation
    water, (d) restrictions imposed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and (e)
    environmental constraints. All these restrictions should ensure that the simulation
    setting reflects the real situation. In general, there is a high percentage of
    horticultural crops (garlic, onion, potato, etc.) included in the rotational crops,
    thus, replacing the traditional field crops in the area, which are economically
    dependent on the CAP compensatory payments (maize, barley, etc.). The woody crops,
    such as vineyards or olives trees, are interesting as well. This diversification
    strategy, when considering market restrictions and European and worldwide policy
    modifications (market globalization), can be essential for the economic viability
    of irrigation. When the mean availability of water resources is reduced, dry farming
    becomes part of the optimum strategy (10–20% of the total area) in average climatic
    years, while crops with high gross margin are usually well irrigated (optimum
    depth). Also, in the selected crop rotations when scarce and expensive water,
    an economic optimization criteria must be used (Ortega et al., 2004a). The results
    of this module are disseminated to technicians and farmers. This information is
    generated after two or three field campaigns in each area when the production
    systems are sufficiently known and the information required for the MOPECO application
    has been collected. In SIAR the results of this process are regarded as orientate,
    and an additional source of information for farmer decisions on planning his crops
    due to the uncertainly of the process and variability in farm costs. 2.2. Field
    irrigation systems evaluations The methodology used for irrigation evaluation
    was derived from well-established references (Merriam and Keller, 1978, Merriam
    et al., 1980, Bralts and Kesner, 1983, Keller and Bliesner, 1990). In the case
    of stationary sprinkler irrigation systems the norms ASAE S330.1 (2004), ASAE
    S398.1 (2004), ISO 7749/1 (1986), and ISO 7749/2 (1990) were applied. For center
    pivot, the ASAE S436.1 (2004) and ISO-11545 (1994) were adopted. Irrigation evaluations
    make possible to identify problems or deficiencies in the irrigation systems,
    which should be solved to improve irrigation efficiency. The application rate,
    under normal working conditions, in both drip and sprinkler irrigation can also
    be derived from irrigation evaluations. Once the gross irrigation requirements
    are determined, the system application rate can be used to calculate the required
    operation time to meet the crop requirements. This level is achieved only in those
    farms where the farmer requests a personalized irrigation scheduling, including
    information about the irrigation set time. 2.3. Dissemination of information There
    are multiple ways of disseminating the information generated by SIAR; among them,
    the following ones can be highlighted: • The information is available in the Internet
    through the web site of “Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha” (http://www.jccm.es)
    or the Regional Water Research Centre (CREA) of Castilla-La Mancha University
    (http://crea.uclm.es) (Fig. 4). Among all the information provided by the web,
    the most valued by farmers is related to the crop water requirements. Fig. 5 presents
    the example of requirements published weekly in an area (Daimiel). Download :

    the web site of JCCM. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example “water
    requirements” data presentation corresponding to the irrigable area of Daimiel.
    The web is completed with the information about other services, the most important
    being the advice for fertilization and the possibility to consult the regional
    meteorological data. The goal of this Internet portal is to offer service rather
    than information. Therefore, in the future, water requirements will be calculated
    for each particular farmer, considering his peculiarities. • Sending weekly information
    by fax to the farmers. Farmers associations and cooperatives often use this way
    of information dissemination. Managers take up the responsibility to make this
    information available to their associates. • Diffusion workshops to present SIAR
    and to present to users the catalogue of available services. • Communication media
    using newspapers, radio and local television. This diffusion level has been employed
    to inform about the activity that the service is developing. 3. Results 3.1. Water
    requirements and irrigation scheduling One of the main activities of SIAR is to
    assess the water requirements of crops and, if personalized cooperation exists,
    to carry out the irrigation scheduling. To achieve this, the parameters that characterize
    each zone must be taken into account (climate, soil, CU of the irrigation systems,
    availability, and irrigation water cost) and the working ETc adj of each crop
    must be defined. The three main strategies to quantify the water requirements
    and irrigation scheduling are as follows: (1) Depth for maximum yield (ETc adj
    = ETm) according to the classic criteria used for irrigation scheduling. In general,
    these are not used by SIAR since they result in an irrigation value that is far
    from the economic optimum of most of the crops. (2) “Optimum” depth for maximum
    gross margin: this depth is obtained from the relation between GM and Dg (Fig.
    6) for the different scenarios of the analysis. Fig. 6 shows the relation between
    GM and Dg for the Tomelloso/Alcázar pilot area and for two crops with different
    characteristics: garlic (high GM and average water requirements) (Fig. 6a) and
    maize (low GM and high water requirements) (Fig. 6b), both in different working
    scenarios (CU and water cost). This depth introduces economical strategies for
    deficit irrigation and is lower than the previous one (Ks = 0.85–0.97 in Eq. (6)).
    In general, for most field crops (with average gross margins), a fixed recommendation
    for the ETc adj objective of 0.85 of ETm is used (Fig. 6b), while for horticultural
    crops (with high gross margin) 0.90 of Ks is used (Fig. 6a). These are the multiplicative
    factors for ETm used by SIAR for determining the irrigation requirements and irrigation

    farmers’ profits and obtain environmental benefits when the water used is reduced.

    (b) maize for a mean year. (3) Maximum EE: this gross irrigation depth is significantly
    lower than the “optimum” (0.70–0.94 of ETm) (Ortega et al., 2004b). Fig. 7 shows
    an example of the EE evolution (Tomelloso/Alcázar pilot area) for several prices
    of the irrigation water for garlic and maize crops. For garlic, one of the crops
    with greater gross margin and higher EE, the maximum EE in the situations studied
    varies between €0.58 and €0.49 m−3 for a water cost of €0.06 and €0.15 m−3, respectively
    (Fig. 7a). For maize, the maximum EE is much lower, €0.17–0.08 m−3 for the water
    costs analyzed (Fig. 7b). Clear differences in water prices are observed, as well
    as maximum EE values registered for depths smaller than for those crops of maximum
    gross margin. Nonetheless, the water depth for maximum EE is maintained for the
    different water costs, this being 325 mm for garlic and of 500 mm for maize (Fig.
    7). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Evolution of the economic efficiency
    for irrigation water use for a CU = 82% and a mean year in Tomelloso/Alcázar area
    on (a) garlic and (b) maize crop. These results are maintained for all the crops
    studied, even though the differences are greater when the gross margin of the
    crop decreases (Ortega et al., 2004b). Usually, the water depth of this irrigation
    strategy is not recommended by SIAR, except for the isolated case of important
    water scarcity. In most of the crops categorized as vines or fruit trees, the
    recommendations involve the use of controlled deficit irrigation, thus ensuring
    a high level of quality with reduced irrigation water. For example, in the case
    of vineyards, irrigation is applied in specific moments, and the ETa during the
    crop season is no higher than 40–50% of the ETm in order to assure medium production
    levels with a high quality for wine production (Montero et al., 2003). The total
    water volume per crop season is, therefore, not higher than 1500 m3 ha−1 (Table
    1). This production level is 6000–10,000 kg ha−1, depending on the zone (climate,
    soil, etc.), variety, canopy management (vessel or trellis), and irrigation systems.
    In any case, experiments for different strategies of controlled deficit continue
    to be carried out. These experiments search for the optimum application moments
    that permit lower water applications. Table 1. Average net irrigation depth for

    the advised net irrigation depths for three pilot areas distributed throughout
    the region (Fig. 3) are presented in Table 1, with each depth determined by the
    principles of economic optimization. The values correspond to the average of three
    or more irrigation seasons, including the coefficient of variation (CV) linked
    to climatic variability. Field crops, such as maize or sugar beet, with high requirements
    and a low CV (lower than 10%) stand out, since their summer cycle and the influence
    of precipitation is not important. On the contrary, other crops such as barley
    or wheat show higher CV, even close to 30% due to the great influence of spring
    precipitation in the final consumption of the crop and the high inter-annual variability
    of precipitation. The horticultural crops, with higher Ks (0.90) present variable
    requirements with average CV. The complexity of the advisory service for these
    crops is higher, especially in those for fresh consumption and with a harvest
    spread out at intervals due to the variability of the cycles and handling (e.g.
    pepper and melon). The fulfilment of the advised water requirements by the farmers
    has been very satisfactory, especially in the areas where farmers had already
    participated in previous seasons. In the new pilot areas where the SIAR was applied
    in the 2001–2003 campaigns, farmers have steadily increased their response to
    the recommendations. About 500 farmers from all pilot areas directly collaborate
    with the service (Table 2) in the monitoring of their exploitations (crops, yields,
    water application, etc.). More than 1200 farmers receive irrigation advice, mainly
    through associations (irrigation districts, or cooperatives), and about 25% of
    the irrigated land in Castilla-La Mancha (100,000 ha) benefits from the SIAR irrigation
    advice. There are great differences in the follow-up of irrigation scheduling
    among different pilot areas (Table 2). This is due to factors, such as water availability
    and cost, irrigation tradition and type of distribution network, and irrigation
    system. In all pilot areas where resources are scarce and application costs are
    high, the adherence to the irrigation advice is also high. In the pilot areas
    of the Tajo basin (Toledo and Guadalajara provinces) where water is not so restricted
    (farmers pay for the irrigation water by surface instead of by volume), the adherence
    of SIAR is low. However, even these farmers resort to SIAR for consultations related
    to crop management or specific problems in their irrigation systems. Table 2.

    Field irrigation systems evaluation From the beginning of the SIAR activities,
    more than 875 irrigation system evaluations have been performed, particularly
    in drip (615) and sprinkler (262) irrigation. In Fig. 9, the average results of
    Emission Uniformity (EU) are presented. The average EU is high with 75% of the
    irrigation systems having values higher than 86%. However, a number of farms have
    been identified that should improve their irrigation uniformity to achieve a better
    irrigation efficiency. In most of the cases, the problems are design-related,
    often including large pressure differences in the irrigation subunit. There are
    important differences between crop categories. In general, fruit trees equipped
    with drip irrigation systems and horticultural crops show the highest EU. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Emission uniformity distribution of drip irrigation
    systems in Castilla-La Mancha (result of 615 field tests). An important problem
    with drip irrigation is the working pressure and the pressure differences within
    the subunits. Fig. 10 displays the histogram of average working pressure distribution,
    remarking that 45% of the evaluated subunits have a working pressure below 100
    kPa (Fig. 10). In some cases, very low pressures were recorded, with average pressures
    of just 18 kPa and minimum pressures in the subunits of 5 kPa. Under these low-pressure
    conditions (lower than 100 kPa), most emitters will fail to work properly. Only
    some pressure-compensating emitters could discharge an adequate flow rate under
    these conditions. Some 30% of the evaluated irrigation systems work at an adequate
    pressure for most emitters (100–150 kPa). The pressure variations within the subunits
    were often found to be excessive due to design problems. However, this judgment
    finally depends on the characteristics of the installed emitter. When the characteristics
    of the emitter and the pressure variations were considered at the same time, most
    of the irrigation laterals were judged to be adequate. Download : Download full-size

    results obtained in sprinkler irrigation are shown in Fig. 11 for permanent solid
    set systems, using the Christiansen''s Uniformity Coefficient (CU). In this case,
    65% of the irrigation systems presented CU''s lower than 85%, and 45% presented
    CU''s lower than 80%. Fig. 12 shows the working pressure in the permanent solid
    set system evaluated, with 50% of the fields showing pressures from 250 to 350
    kPa, well adapted to the most frequent sprinkler spacing. Download : Download

    pivots, the Hermann and Hein''s Uniformity Coefficient (CUh) is presented in Fig.

    the machines, the CUh is lower than 80%. All these center pivots have design problems
    and in a number of cases, management problems have been identified as well (e.g.
    inadequate working pressure or sprinklers package). Normally, these machines are
    in areas with scarce tradition in its management. In such areas, the SIAR''s work
    is essential to train the farmers in its management and in the necessity of an
    adequate design. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Result of evaluation
    in center pivot (result of 105 field tests). 3.3. Main limitations to proper functioning
    of SIAR When considering the implantation of advisory services in other areas,
    it is important to consider the limitations that have arisen during the SIAR experience:
    • Scientific limitations: even if the teams are multidisciplinary, some of the
    methodologies and the parameterization of the model used (e.g. for the estimation
    of irrigation requirements and irrigation scheduling) had not been scientifically
    contrasted in all the pilot areas of Castilla-La Mancha. In addition, local experimentation
    on crop fertilization had not been generalized. • Technical limitations: SIAR
    needs to broaden its activities and extend to additional crops, mainly fruit trees,
    yield and quality studies regarding irrigation depths that are required for decision-making.
    Phenological studies need to be further developed to establish the duration of
    the different phenological stages of additional crops. To achieve efficient results,
    the SIAR needs to pursue the adequate maintenance of the weather stations, including
    calibration and sensors check-up, adequate grass coverage of the area surrounding
    the station, and immediate repairs of sensors and data-loggers. The SIAR must
    integrate different strategies of irrigation scheduling from real economic and
    agronomic information from farms, promoting seasonal deficit irrigation, controlled
    deficit irrigation, application of depths for maximum gross margin and support
    irrigation. • Institutional limitations: possibilities of information dissemination,
    implication of public institutions, and structure and organic dependence of the
    service. • Sociological limitations: irrigation tradition, expertise level and
    age of the farmer, presence of additional technicians in the farmer''s association
    or irrigation district. • Budgetary limitations: the need of local experimentation
    and large staff allocations for dissemination activities (courses, congresses,
    and workshops). A possible solution is the establishment of cooperation agreements
    with private organizations (districts or cooperatives), public administration
    and research centers or universities. In addition, SIAR is completely free as
    a demonstration project for the farmers during the first years. To achieve the
    SIAR objectives in the current pilot areas (Table 2), 12 field technicians are
    needed. Investments include the equipment necessary for the irrigation system
    evaluations and irrigation scheduling. The total annual cost of the SIAR is €260,000.
    The yearly maintenance costs for the agro-meteorological stations and other durables
    add up to an additional €36,000. Consequently, the total yearly cost of the SIAR
    is €296,000. Since the total advised area benefited by the SIAR has been estimated
    as about 100,000 ha, the average cost is lower than €3 ha−1. This cost, nowadays
    founded by the Regional Government of Castilla-La Mancha, is having a clear effect
    on the global irrigation efficiency, improving farm competitiveness, and minimizing
    the irrigation environmental impact. 4. Conclusions There are important differences
    in irrigation management among the pilot areas of the region depending on the
    irrigation tradition, availability and cost of resources, etc. Thus, in general,
    the drought-prone areas and/or those having a higher water cost are characterized
    by a large SIAR follow-up by farmers. This is often demonstrated by a sustained
    request of assistance from SIAR technicians. An advisory service for the economic
    aspects of irrigation scheduling and requirements for crop water are very important
    in a context of water scarcity and high cost. Under these conditions, SIAR recommendations
    are increasingly followed since they allow farmers to optimize their productive
    process and the competitiveness of their farms. As a result of the irrigation
    evaluations, in general, the irrigation systems present an adequate uniformity
    of water application. On the other hand, their level of water application is correct,
    even if in some areas it would be advisable to improve the management and to recommend
    the farmer to follow more technical irrigation scheduling criteria. A higher integration
    of the farmers associations in the SIAR is necessary, taking the responsibility,
    along with the Regional Government of Agricultural and the University of Castilla-La
    Mancha to achieve as soon as possible and in the most efficient way, the desired
    objectives. The average cost of the actuation in the area is lower than €3 ha−1
    yr−1, and the benefits obtained with the SIAR extend not only to the reduction
    of water use, but also to irrigation efficiency and environmental improvement.

    farming is the greatest consumer of the Earth’s freshwater resources. In the light
    of an increasing water demand caused by growing population, effective methods
    are required that use the available water resources efficiently and increase the
    overall productivity of irrigation systems. In this contribution, a combined approach
    of simulation–optimization and experiments was applied to investigate and evaluate
    two different irrigation strategies and their parameters for maize with the objective
    to achieve high water productivity (WP) with high reliability. Thereby, a soil–vegetation–atmosphere
    transfer (SVAT) model was used to simulate crop growth and soil water transport,
    together with task-specific optimization algorithms to determine optimal parameters
    for irrigation schedules and sensor-based full and deficit irrigation controls.
    An intensively monitored 3-year irrigation experiment was conducted for testing
    different irrigation designs and verifying the simulation–optimization approach.
    A new sensor for measuring soil water potentials from pF 0 to pF 7 allowed for
    applying optimized irrigation thresholds greater than 1,000 hPa. Attained from
    the irrigation experiments were generally high and ranged from 1.8 to . The impact
    of irrigation system parameters on WP, such as irrigation interval, sensor depth,
    number of irrigation thresholds, and the soil’s initial water content were evaluated
    and discussed. Results indicate that thresholds beyond the measurement range of
    commonly used tensiometers are feasible. Furthermore, the combination of SVAT-modeling
    and optimization has the potential to systematically investigate and improve irrigation
    systems as well as to reduce the number of required field experiments. Similar

    13 July 2021 Introduction Seventy percent of the Earth’s freshwater resources
    are used for agriculture (FAO 2010). Especially in arid and semi-arid regions,
    characterized by low availability of freshwater from renewable sources, the water
    demand for agriculture has competition from the municipal and the industrial sector.
    The increase in population may further intensify the distribution problem leaving
    little space for wasting water due to bad management or low efficiency in irrigation
    practices. Investigations and techniques are needed that foster good water management
    practices by developing methods further that support water-saving strategies as
    shown by Feng et al. (2011), Liu and Wang (2012), and Masoud and Atwia (2011),
    among others. The task is to improve the overall productivity of the irrigation
    system in order to use the available water resources more efficiently. The performance
    of an irrigation systems is reflected by its water use efficiency or water productivity
    (WP). When confronted with severe water scarcity, increasing or improving WP of
    irrigation systems is, in general, a viable strategy to conserve limited water
    resources and to make best use of the available water supply. WP is defined by
    a gain over its expenses. This could be, for instance, the amount of assimilated
    carbon, crop yield, marketable yield or any generated amount of produce for each
    unit of transpiration or evapotranspiration (ET) (Molden et al. 2010; Vazifedoust
    et al. 2008). In the irrigation sector, WP refers to crop yield over applied water.
    Where only directly provided irrigation water is considered, it is referred to
    as and may also include precipitation, if contributing considerably. When related
    to evapotranspiration, the term is used, which also recognizes the change in the
    soil water reserve ( ). An overview of achieved from experiments was provided
    by Zwart and Bastiaanssen (2004), where values range from 0.6 to 1.7  for wheat,
    0.6– for rice, 0.14– for cotton, and 1.1– for maize. The range in indicates great
    potential for improvement. When looking at the lower values in particular, these
    figures seem to come from irrigation systems that run little efficient. A suboptimal
    full irrigation (FI) system, for instance, is characterized by high yields but
    also high percolation losses from over-irrigation, which will result in a low
    WP (English 1990). Fully irrigated, suboptimal irrigation systems ought to be
    transformed into optimal FI systems, where yields are still high but little to
    none water is lost by deep percolation. Improvements of WP beyond that point can
    only be achieved by optimal deficit irrigation (DI), which makes use of the plant’s
    different phases of susceptibility to water stress. During flowering, for instance,
    tolerance to drought is mostly little and stress should be avoided. Other phases
    are less prone to stress and water can be saved without affecting yield formation
    greatly. To achieve an optimal water supply, an accuracy is needed, which can
    only be provided by drip irrigation systems (Jones 2004). The success of DI systems
    depends on their irrigation scheduling (Shock and Wang 2011). It is mandatory
    to maintain the soil water status in a suitable range for plant production. For
    FI systems, that range would be around field capacity, whereas for DI systems
    it is not easy to determine. Besides plant or soil water balance-based approaches
    for irrigation scheduling, a suitable option is to find a water status-based indicator
    for triggering irrigation such as the soil water potential. Using the soil water
    potential is reasonable when looking at the working principle behind plant transpiration.
    The plant serves as transmitter of pressure gradients between soil and atmosphere.
    Therefore, the soil water potential of the surrounding soil can be directly related
    to exerted stresses in the plant tissue. Furthermore, characteristic points of
    soil water potential are similar for all soils whereas the soil moisture differs,
    depending on soil type and profile. Hysteresis effects have also not to be considered
    (Shock and Wang 2011). Thresholds, that are used for irrigation scheduling in
    such a way, find their implementation in sensor-based irrigation systems. A lot
    of research has been conducted for finding suitable irrigation thresholds, irrigation
    amounts, and sensor positions for irrigation control, but investigations seem
    to focus rather on trial and error methods in field experiments. Derived thresholds
    for maize and other vegetables, such as tomato, onion, or potato, range from 100
    to 500 hPa (Wang et al. 2007a, b; Steele et al. 1994; Rivera-Hernandez et al.
    2010) and seem to be limited to the measurement range of commonly used tensiometers,
    which is 700 to 800 hPa. However, field experiments are time consuming and expensive,
    and fail to encompass all environmental boundary conditions, present as well as
    future. Results are not transferable to other sites and restricted to the conditions
    under which the experiment was run. Therefore, extending field experiments by
    soil–vegetation–atmosphere transfer (SVAT) modeling that help to understand and
    calculate involved processes, such as water transport and crop growth, offers
    the opportunity to investigate other yield-affecting factors and to generalize
    results, thus making them transferable to other sites, while reducing experimental
    expenditures. Many SVAT-models such as APSIM (Keating et al. 2003), Daisy (Abrahamsen
    and Hansen 2000), or Pilote (Mailhol et al. 1997) are available and were tested
    in various applications for their suitability to simulate crop growth (e.g., Asseng
    et al. 2013; Kloss et al. 2012; Palosuo et al. 2011). Combining SVAT-modeling
    with optimization allows finding optimal irrigation thresholds for irrigation
    scheduling with regard to the desired objective such as crop yield, farm profit
    or others. Soundharajan and Sudheer (2009) examined optimal irrigation schedules
    for rice using the crop model ORYZA2000 and a genetic algorithm. Dabach et al.
    (2013) applied Hydrus2D/3D for determining optimal irrigation thresholds in sensor-based
    irrigation systems, but the model was not suited to simulate a whole growing period.
    Schütze et al. (2012b) presented the optimization method Global Evolutionary Technique
    for Optimal Irrigation Scheduling (GET-OPTIS) that can be coupled with any SVAT-model
    for simulating and optimizing the scheduling of DI systems over the whole growing
    period. This method is able to achieve highest crop yield for a previously defined
    but limited amount of water while minimizing the number of decision variables,
    i.e., number of irrigation events. Mailhol et al. (2011) applied GET-OPTIS in
    a study where a combination of simulation, optimization and field experiments
    was used to achieve a certain targeted crop yield by optimized DI schedules for
    surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems. However, many simulation–optimization-based
    approaches do not regard variability from soils and climate (e.g., precipitation,
    temperature or solar radiation), which is mandatory to obtain reliable irrigation
    schedules. Studies that investigate WP and considered climate variability and
    change were conducted by Semenov (2007), Soltani and Hoogenboom (2007), and Garcia
    et al. (2008), among others, but focused mainly on rain-fed, non-irrigated or
    fully irrigated sites. For DI systems, Brown et al. (2010) derived optimal irrigation
    schedules for maximizing farm profits under a limited water supply by identifying
    soil moisture levels that would trigger irrigation. Brumbelow and Georgakakos
    (2007) derived probability functions of crop production, so-called crop water
    production functions (CWPFs), where climate change scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change were incorporated to estimate potential crop production.
    Based on this concept, Schütze and Schmitz (2010) developed the framework Optimal
    Climate Change Adaption Strategies for Irrigation (OCCASION) that allows for generalizing
    and utilizing site-specific stochastic CWPFs. These functions contained optimal
    and, with regard to climate variability, reliable irrigation schedules for DI
    systems and were applied in a case study for an arid environment (Schütze et al.
    2012a). However, all these contributions were merely theoretical studies and were
    not tested in real-world application nor were they used in conjunction with field
    experiments. A comprehensive application of experiment, simulation and optimization
    for improving irrigation systems seems to still be missing (McCarthy et al. 2013).
    In this contribution, existing gaps were addressed by employing a simulation–optimization
    approach for investigating optimal irrigation strategies. These strategies included
    optimal irrigation schedules and sensor-based irrigation systems with focus on
    DI and were compared to a fully irrigated reference. The simulation–optimization
    approach was accompanied by an intensively monitored irrigation experiment with
    drip-irrigated maize in containers in a greenhouse. For monitoring and irrigation
    control, a new sensor called pF-meter was used that allowed measuring the soil
    water potential in a range between 1 and (pF 0 to pF 7). Focus was put on improving
    WP and the investigation of factors that determine the behavior of the irrigation
    system, namely irrigation interval, sensor depth, number of irrigation thresholds,
    and the soil’s initial water content (IWC). Results from the experiment were used
    to verify the simulation–optimization approach as well as to compare, evaluate
    and discuss the performance of investigated irrigation strategies. Materials and
    methods This section describes the combined approach of the simulation–optimization
    and the experiments to investigate two different irrigation strategies regarding
    WP. The methodologies for determining optimal irrigation schedules and optimal
    parameters for a sensor-based irrigation strategy are laid out and treatments
    that were derived from these strategies are presented. This is followed by the
    layout of the experiment where these treatments were tested in a greenhouse with
    drip-irrigated maize. Optimal irrigation strategies For determining optimal decision
    variables for both irrigation strategies the simulation–optimization framework,
    OCCASION (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) was used and slightly adapted to better fit
    the presented problem. The adapted framework consists of three parts: (i) the
    weather generator LARS-WG (Semenov et al. 1998) that provides site-specific synthetic
    weather series with statistically comparable properties from observed weather
    thus adding statistical significance to the investigated objective; (ii) the crop
    growth model Daisy (Abrahamsen and Hansen 2000 ) for simulating plant production
    and water consumption; and (iii) an optimization algorithm that finds optimal
    solutions for the applied irrigation strategy and under given constraints. Daisy
    is a physically based 1D soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model with a modular
    structure. Modules for bioclimate, vegetation and soil allow to determine fluxes
    and balances for water, heat, and solutes. Crop growth is simulated by photosynthesis
    and respiration. The crop’s development is divided into the development stages
    (DS) of emergence (DS 0), flowering (DS 1), and maturation (DS 2) where the thermal
    time determines the duration of each stage. The single root concept is applied
    to withdraw water from the ground. Water transport through the soil matrix is
    calculated by Richards equation. Daisy uses daily values of observed weather to
    operate. Daisy was tested for moderate and no water stress scenarios and performed
    satisfactorily (Kloss et al. 2012). An already calibrated and validated Daisy
    model for the experimental station Lavalette in Montpellier, France where maize
    of the same variety was grown in 2007 and 2009 (Mailhol et al. 2011; Seidel 2012)
    was used for the optimization. Optimal irrigation schedule Objective of an optimal
    irrigation schedule was to maximize the crop yield Y for a given but limited amount
    of water , which is distributed over the growing period of the crop. The amount
    of individual irrigation events as well as dates when to irrigate had to be determined.
    The effect of the irrigation schedule on the crop yield was simulated by the Daisy
    model. The optimization problem can be described as a mixed integer nonlinear
    optimization problem with continuous and discrete decision variables by the objective
    function : (1) (2) (3) with the yield and the irrigation schedule over the growing
    period, consisting of with individual irrigation events. Each individual event
    is specified by a date and an irrigation amount . The number of irrigation events
    is not fixed and part of the optimization, i.e., a decision variable itself. The
    objective function is deducted by a regulatory term that accounts for the number
    and equality of individual irrigation events. The smaller the number of individual
    events and the closer their values to each other, the smaller the deduction and
    the higher the fitness value. This is implemented for practical reasons in real-world
    application by ensuring the irrigation events to be as small in numbers and as
    equal in amounts as possible. The optimization is additionally subjected to the
    constraints the minimum time between consecutive irrigation events and the minimum
    amount of water per irrigation event, which reduces computational efforts by restricting
    irrigation schedules to feasible solutions only. The computation of optimal irrigation
    schedules is done by GET-OPTIS (Schütze et al. 2012b) and starts with a random
    set of schedules (population). Each member has a fitness value assigned to it
    which is directly related to the objective function . This fitness value is determined
    and tried to be maximized in each iteration step of the optimization. The optimal
    irrigation schedule for highest is then: (4) For determining optimal schedules
    in this study, an average year was derived from 500 years of synthetic weather
    provided by LARS-WG. Synthetic weather scenarios are normally used to increase
    the reliability of derived schedules by incorporating the statistical characteristics
    of a random sample of generated weather scenarios. In order to reduce computational
    efforts, however, the average year was used instead. The optimization loop (Fig.
    1) maximized the crop yield (according to Eq. 1) for that average year for a given
    amount of water , which was chosen in a way to apply moderate water stress only.
    The irrigation schedule started after an initial full irrigation phase until root
    water uptake at the 30 cm depth in the irrigation experiment, which was conducted
    parallel, was apparent in order to ensure plant establishment. Therefore, the
    soil’s IWC as well as irrigation events from that phase were part of the simulation
    model. The solution converged in less than 1,000 iterations. Fig. 1 Methodological
    procedure for determining optimal irrigation schedules (modified after Schütze
    and Schmitz 2010) Full size image Optimal sensor-based strategy The design of
    an optimal sensor-based irrigation strategy requires knowledge about appropriate
    soil water potential thresholds as well as sensor positions triggering the irrigation,
    the irrigation amount per irrigation event and the pause between consecutive irrigation
    events. Those parameters should be determined in a way to allow for achieving
    a high crop yield or WP with high reliability under varying local weather conditions.
    In order to account for the variability of local weather, the optimization problem
    was described in a probabilistic form: (5) (6) (7) with the objective function
    that aimed at maximizing the probability P of being equal or higher than the 90
    %-quantile, meaning that this value will be achieved in 90 % of all cases of possible
    weather realizations. The optimal solution is then: (8) Decision variables were
    the soil water potential thresholds and the irrigation amount per irrigation event
    for numbers of considered plant development stages. The sensor position and the
    pause between consecutive irrigation events were fixed and subject to analysis
    within field experiments. Two constraints were introduced: the total amount of
    water from individual irrigation events had to exceed a minimum total irrigation
    to ensure exerted water stress to the crops was moderate only; and a minimum yield
    had to be reached or surpassed. The sensor-based irrigation control started after
    an initial full irrigation plan which ensured that obvious root water uptake was
    observed at the 30 cm sensor depth in the irrigation experiment. Hence, the soil’s
    IWC and applied irrigation until the sensor-based control was implemented, were
    part of the simulation model. Fig. 2 Methodological procedure for determining
    optimal sensor-based irrigation strategies Full size image The determination of
    optimal parameters for the sensor-based DI strategies was carried out as a Monte
    Carlo optimization, consisting of an inner Monte Carlo step and an outer optimization
    loop (Fig. 2). Out of 500 years of generated weather realizations from historical
    weather data, 200 realizations were randomly chosen and simulated by the calibrated
    Daisy model for an initial set of decision variables—the soil water potential
    threshold and irrigation amount per irrigation event—provided by the optimization
    algorithm. values were calculated for each of the simulations and analyzed statistically
    in order to determine the 90 %-quantile of . The single objective method Covariance
    Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES, Hansen 2006) was used to solve the
    outlined optimization problem, which aimed on maximizing the value of the 90 %-quantile
    by improving the set of decision variables. Depending on the number of sensor-based
    irrigation phases, the number of decision variables varied between two (for )
    and eight (for ). Here as well, the solution converged in less than 1,000 iterations.
    Fig. 3 Experimental layout of the irrigation experiment with the containers from
    side view: a including sensor positions in the main container (Main) and replicates
    (R1 and R2) and their aggregation b to four treatments (i, j, m, n) shown in top
    view Full size image Investigated treatments The above presented methodologies
    were used to calculate different designs of schedule-based and sensor-based irrigation
    strategies. These treatments differed in the irrigation interval, the location
    of the sensor that controlled irrigation, the number of irrigation thresholds,
    and the soil’s IWC. This allowed comparing irrigation strategies with each other
    as well as to investigate the effects of their designs on WP. A treatment for
    a deficit irrigation schedule (DI-schedule) was calculated and served as comparison
    for the sensor-based irrigation strategies. For the sensor-based deficit irrigation
    treatments, a single constant threshold and irrigation amount per irrigation event
    was investigated. A depth of 20 and 30 cm for the location of the sensor that
    controlled irrigation was selected to see whether a greater or lower sensor depth
    is more preferable. To account for water redistribution in the soil after an irrigation,
    two minimum pauses between irrigation events were chosen, namely 4 and 24 h. The
    corresponding treatments were named DI1-4h-30cm, DI1-24h-30cm and DI1-24h-20cm.
    Another treatment comprised four irrigation thresholds and respective irrigation
    amounts per event to better account for the stress susceptibility of the plant’s
    development stages and to compare it to the single threshold treatments. Plant
    development was divided into vegetative phase (before DS 0.75), flowering (DS
    0.75–DS 1.15), yield formation (DS 1.15–DS 1.75) and ripening (DS 1.75–DS 2.0).
    The treatment was denoted DI4-4h-30cm, with the minimum pause set to 4 h and the
    sensor positioned at a depth of 30 cm. The sensor-based fully irrigated reference
    FI-4h-30cm served as comparison to all investigated treatments. For all treatments,
    nutrition deficiency of plants was disregarded and an irrigation efficiency of
    100 % assumed. Experimental layout Irrigation strategies were tested in an intensively
    monitored irrigation experiment under controlled conditions. The experiment was
    carried out in a greenhouse located at Dürnast experimental station, Technische
    Universität München, Germany ( , elevation 473 m). The roof of the greenhouse
    was opened on days without precipitation and was otherwise closed to avoid additional
    water to the treatments from rainfall. Maize (Zea maize L., variety Pioneer PR36K67)
    was grown in containers in three consecutive years (2010–2012) (Fig. 3b). Each
    container was in size ( ). The maize was sown in the middle of May and harvested
    by the end of September. Each container held five maize plants in a single plant
    row. Three containers were combined to one treatment with the main container in
    the middle and bordered by the replicates (Main, R1, and R2, respectively). Plant
    row spacing measured 75 cm with a plant density of ten plants per square meter.
    The soil was filled into the container up to a height of 70 cm and was composed
    of 77 % sand and 23 % silt (according to USDA). The bottom was sealed so no water
    could seep out of the container. The drip line was placed alongside each plant
    row with drip emitters in close proximity to the plant and a discharge rate of
    . Fig. 4 Sums of daily mean global radiation in  (left) and daily mean temperature
    (right) expressed as cumulative heat during the 3-year irrigation experiment series
    from observation in 2010 (solid), 2011 (dashed) and 2012 (dotted). The average
    synthetic year (thick solid) was used for calculating optimal schedules. Synthetic
    global radiation, minimum and maximum temperature are depicted in light gray (solid)
    Full size image Soil moisture and soil water potential was monitored at the depths
    of 20, 30, 40 and (Fig. 3a) by pairs of TDR probes (CS630, Co. Campbell Scientific,
    Inc., USA) and pF-meters (Co. ecoTech Umwelt-MeSSsysteme GmbH, Germany). The measurement
    principle behind the pF-meter allowed for measuring the soil water potential in
    a range from 1 to (pF 0 to pF 7). The sensor uses a heat impulse to measure the
    amount of water in the sensor’s ceramic tip, which is in contact with the surrounding
    soil matrix, and derives the respective soil water potential from the change in
    temperature during that measurement. Sensor pairs at the 20 and depth were horizontally
    displaced by 15 and around the middle, respectively, while the remaining pairs
    were arranged in a vertical line below the plant. Sensor readings were taken every
    15 min. Weather data (solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
    and wind direction) was collected by a weather station inside the greenhouse as
    well as by a nearby meteorological station outside. Fig. 5 Sensor readings of
    soil moisture a and soil water potential b in four different sensor depths of
    the main container for a sensor-based treatment (DI4-4h-30cm) including applied
    irrigation and irrigation thresholds after finishing the fully irrigated initial
    phase (shaded area) Full size image All treatments were fully irrigated at the
    beginning until obvious root water uptake was observed at the 30 cm sensor depth.
    After that, irrigation practices were changed to optimal irrigation schedules
    and optimal sensor-based irrigation strategies. Results Overview about the experiments
    The irrigation experiments took, on average, 137 days per year from sowing to
    harvest. The maize received a global radiation sum of in total 1,500 and a cumulative
    heat, expressed as growing degree days or thermal time, of 2,850 simply by adding
    daily mean temperatures. This lay well within the range of magnitude from the
    synthetic time series that were provided by the weather generator for model calculations
    (Fig. 4). Table 1 Overview of investigated deficit irrigation treatments (DI)

    soil water potential thresholds. It shows the different phases of stress the plant
    was subjected to and how soil moisture and soil water potential changed with depth
    from one irrigation phase to another. During the fully irrigated initial phase,
    the soil moisture content was high. Through plant growth and subsequent root water
    uptake, the soil dried up considerably. The first sensor-based irrigation phase
    (before DS 0.75) provided the upper soil layer with enough water, whereas in the
    lower soil layer the water content diminished further. The second irrigation phase
    (before DS 0.75–DS 1.15), which can be regarded as full irrigation due to the
    low irrigation threshold (in pF), replenished the upper soil layers anew but water
    never reached the lowest roots at 60 cm. During the third irrigation phase (DS
    1.15–DS 1.75), more stress was exerted on the plants. Three distinct irrigation
    events took place that essentially affected the whole root zone. The final irrigation
    phase (DS 1.75–DS 2.0) was characterized by an even higher soil water potential
    threshold with irrigation that did not have any considerable impact on the overall
    water balance anymore. Optimal irrigation schedule strategy For the optimization,
    was chosen with in 2010 and in 2012, respectively. The IWC measured 28 % in 2010
    and 10.5 % in 2012, respectively. Upon completion of the fully irrigated initial
    phase, computed irrigation schedules (DI-schedule) (Fig. 6a) resulted in irrigation
    amounts per irrigation event of 6–20 mm in 2010 and in 2012, respectively. From
    the irrigation experiments, a dry grain yield of 9.1 and was harvested, with a
    total irrigation amount of 332 and . The change in soil water reserve measured
    136 and , resulting in a total water consumption of 468 and , respectively. Derived
    from those results, the treatment in 2010 reached a of and in 2012, respectively.
    Taking overall consumed water into account, changed to in 2010 and in 2012, respectively.
    Optimal sensor-based irrigation strategy Single constant threshold for all sensor-based
    irrigation designs was set to 250 mm and to . For the deficit irrigation treatment
    with constant irrigation threshold and minimum irrigation pause of 4 h (DI1-4h-30cm),
    an optimal irrigation threshold of pF 3.1 ( 1,259 hPa) and an irrigation amount
    per event of was determined (Fig. 6b). In the irrigation experiment a crop yield
    of and was harvested in 2010 and 2011, respectively. 415 and 553 mm was applied
    for irrigation with a change in the soil water reserve of 147 and 16 mm. The overall
    consumed water measured 562 and 569 mm leading to a of and , and a of and , respectively.
    Treatments, for which the minimum irrigation pause was increased to 24 h (DI1-24h-30cm),
    resulted in a threshold of pF 3.26 ( 1,820 ) and pF 2.99 ( 982 ) for the years
    2011 (Fig. 6c) and 2012, respectively. An amount of 36 and 30 mm was applied per
    irrigation event. Yields reached and with a total of applied water of 445 and
    503 mm. The change in the soil water reserve was 39 and 54 mm resulting in a total
    of 484 and 449 mm of consumed water. Calculated reached and , and a of and , respectively.
    The change of the sensor depth to 20 cm for irrigation control (DI1-24h-20cm)
    resulted in a threshold of pF 3.30 ( 1,995 ) and an irrigation amount per event
    of 39 mm (Fig. 6d). The treatment produced in crop yield and consumed 559 mm of
    water for irrigation. The soil water reserve changed by only 13 mm leading to
    an overall water consumption of 546 mm. and both reached . Multiple constant thresholds
    The treatment with multiple constant thresholds adapted to the four development
    stages of the crop (DI4-4h-30cm) resulted in the thresholds pF 3.15 ( 1,413 hPa),
    pF 2.18 ( 151 hPa), pF 3.10 ( 1,259 hPa), and pF 3.57 ( 3,715 hPa) with irrigation
    amounts per development stage and event of 6, 3, 11, and 2 mm, respectively (Fig.
    6e). were harvested from this treatment and 407 mm of total irrigation water was
    used. The soil water reserve changed by 164 mm and led to a total of 571 mm of
    consumed water. This resulted in a of and a of . Fully irrigated reference The
    fully irrigated reference treatments (FI-4h-30cm), where a single constant threshold
    and a 4-h minimum irrigation pause was used, resulted in a threshold of pF 2.10
    ( 125 hPa) and an irrigation amount of 7 mm per irrigation event (Fig. 6f). ,
    and were harvested in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. The total applied
    irrigation was 571, 630 and 621 mm. The soil water reserve changed by 4, 5 and
    14 mm resulting in a total water consumption of 567, 635 and 635 mm, respectively.
    for these 3 years was and . Considering the changes in the soil water reserve,
    measured , and . Discussion Attained for all investigated treatments from the
    irrigation experiment ranged from to and were generally high. Values lay well
    within the range of reported from other studies for maize, which ranged from to
    (Zwart and Bastiaanssen 2004). Irrigation schedule strategy vs. sensor-based irrigation
    strategy for irrigation schedule treatments ranged from to and lay within the
    range of sensor-based treatments where a between and was achieved. Applying irrigation
    water for sensor-based treatments was triggered automatically whenever the controlling
    sensor detected the soil water potential to exceed the threshold, whereas individual
    irrigation events from the irrigation schedule had to be entered manually into
    the irrigation controller and were then triggered automatically without personal
    attendance. The calculation of an optimal irrigation schedule would have been
    computationally even more demanding than for the sensor-based method since the
    number of decision variables would differ for every year used in the optimization.
    The extent of the optimization problem was therefore reduced by using an average
    year for the determination of optimal schedules. Nevertheless, the number of decision
    variables remained high with 27 (13 from the date of irrigation and 13 from the
    irrigation amount per event and 1 from ) in 2010 and 23 in 2012, respectively.
    For sensor-based treatments, merely multiples of two decision variables (i.e.,
    threshold and irrigation amount per event ) were needed depending on the number
    of irrigation phases, which was chosen as one and four, thus having two and eight
    decision variables, respectively. Based on the experiences from the conducted
    experiments, the irrigation schedule has the advantage of having relatively low
    expenses when comparing implementation costs for both strategies with each other.
    It is best suited for places where little precipitation occurs during the growing
    season, e.g., arid regions. A schedule would then have to be determined only once,
    preferably before the growing season begins and can be employed indefinitely (if
    boundary conditions do not change). There are no sensors for irrigation control
    or other equipment for evaluation needed. Potentials of irrigation schedules where
    CWPFs were used as a planning tool in irrigation farming and in integrated water
    resources management systems were discussed in Schütze et al. (2012a) and Grundmann
    et al. (2012), respectively. Optimal deficit irrigation vs. optimal full irrigation
    A comparison of achieved WP between optimal DI treatments and fully irrigated
    reference treatments showed no significant differences, which implies that DI
    treatments were not more successful than their FI counterpart. By definition,
    a DI treatment is then successful when its WP is considerably higher than that
    of a fully irrigated reference. However, the outline of the irrigation experiment
    with maize being grown in sealed containers prevented percolation from the root
    zone. Surplus water, which might have been applied could be stored at the bottom
    of the container and later be used by the plants. Under real field conditions
    that water would have percolated through the root zone and would have been lost
    for plant consumption. That would have increased the required irrigation amount
    for the fully irrigated reference, thus further reducing WP for FI treatments,
    as shown by Kloss et al. (2014) in which a detailed analysis of water transport
    and impacts on WP for open and closed containers was conducted. None of the DI
    treatments showed water being accumulated at the bottom of the container, whereas
    for the FI treatments, sensors at the 60 cm showed an accumulation of irrigation
    water. In any case, overall water consumed by the crop was smaller for DI compared
    to the fully irrigated reference with water savings up to 30 %. Optimal sensor-based
    deficit treatments Minimum irrigation pause Different minimum irrigation pauses
    between irrigation events (DI1-4h-30cm and DI1-24h-30cm, Table 1) seemed to have
    little effect on with achieved values ranging from to . However, overall water
    consumption of the treatments with 24 h of irrigation pause reduced applied irrigation
    by around 100 mm. Those treatments stood out by their fewer total irrigation events,
    but higher irrigation amounts per application. Such an irrigation practice generally
    reduces soil evaporation and supports root development into deeper soil layers,
    since the bigger part of water is transported there and roots will follow (Asseng
    et al. 1998; Weaver 1926). The chance of percolation and water transport out of
    the root zone increases, however, if irrigation is controlled poorly. Depth of
    the controlling sensor of the treatment with its sensor placed at 20 cm for irrigation
    control, (DI1-24h-20cm 2011), reached , which was slightly lower than the treatment
    with its sensor at 30 cm (DI1-24h-30cm 2011) with . However, the closer proximity
    of the sensor to the soil surface increased the total water consumption by 62
    mm. A sensor at a lower depth might be beneficial for initial development stages
    where roots are not fully developed yet and confined to a limited depth, but with
    passing time and progressing plant development, placing the sensor deeper into
    the ground seems to be beneficial. Panda et al. (2004) reported that maize plants
    get most of their water from a depth between 0 and 45 cm. Taking treatment DI1-4h-30cm
    2010 into account, water-saving effects seemed to be countered by lower irrigation
    intervals. Irrigation thresholds The threshold for the fully irrigated reference
    was determined with 125 hPa. Previously conducted investigations with a sensor-based
    irrigation control covered only a range from 50 to 800 hPa with recommended thresholds
    of 300 hPa for maize and highest (Rivera-Hernandez et al. 2010). Results from
    the plant growth-adapted deficit irrigation treatment DI4-4h-30cm seem to be inconclusive
    as the achieved of is in the range of of the single constant threshold treatments
    DI1-4h-30cm and DI1-24h-30cm. It was assumed that thresholds adapted to the development
    stage of the crop better account for stress sensitive and insensitive stages thus
    resulting in higher WP. Further research is required in that regard. The use of
    pF-meters for monitoring and irrigation control allowed the observation of much
    drier states of the soil than commonly used tensiometers would have made possible.
    Thresholds for DI phases in treatments (in single- and multi-DI-threshold treatments)
    ranged from 1,259 to 3,700 hPa. No other studies, reporting similar thresholds
    for sensor-based irrigation control, could be found. Initial soil water content
    The soil’s IWC at the beginning of the growing period affected achieved WP tremendously.
    By considering and , it was tried to account for these impacts. When IWC was high,
    less water was needed for irrigation since the plant could use the water already
    stored inside the soil, thus leading to an overall high . By considering the change
    in the soil water reserve, a more realistic WP regarding the true water consumption,
    i.e., , was obtained. For instance, DI-schedule 2010 started with a high IWC leading
    to a of , whereas DI-schedule 2012 began with low IWC and achieved a of . By taking
    changes of the soil moisture into account, both treatments actually consumed the
    same amount of water (around ), thus reaching a of in both cases. The same observation
    could be made for DI1-4h-30cm 2010 and DI4-4h-30cm 2010 where for both a greater
    than was reached but when looked at the change in the soil water reserve, both
    treatments achieved a of and , respectively. Beyond that, low IWC resulted in
    generally higher irrigation sums for the initial full irrigation phase since the
    soil water reserve was replenished until the irrigation threshold was reached.
    The IWC seems to have an effect on the efficiency of DI systems. In cases where
    IWC is high, plants profit from the water stored in the soil thus less irrigation
    water is needed. Farmers would profit from high IWC conditions where only that
    extra amount of water not stored in the soil would have to be provided. Regions
    such as in the Mediterranean or in semi-arid climates are examples where there
    is little water from precipitation during the growing season (for instance in
    summer) (Peel et al. 2007). During the off-season the soils would get replenished
    “for free” which the farmer can then use in the next season. The variable weather
    conditions would make a sensor-based irrigation control more feasible. When IWC
    conditions are low, farmers have to rely solely on irrigation water, thus the
    difference between and is negligible. Regions where there is little to none precipitation
    such as in arid climates are examples for that (Peel et al. 2007). Those regions
    would be eligible for schedule-based irrigation strategies. Summary and conclusion
    A combined approach of SVAT-modeling, optimization and experiments was applied
    for investigating and improving different irrigation strategies with regard to
    their WP. The approach consisted of the SVAT-model Daisy for simulating soil water
    transport and crop growth, and optimization methods: GET-OPTIS for determining
    optimal irrigation schedules describing when and how much to irrigate, and CMA-ES
    for finding optimal irrigation thresholds and irrigation amounts for sensor-based
    full and deficit irrigation systems. The investigation aimed for high WP with
    high reliability. Results from the optimization for different irrigation designs
    were tested in intensively monitored container experiments with drip-irrigated
    maize in a greenhouse. A new sensor that allowed measuring soil water potentials
    from pF 0 to pF 7 was used for irrigation control. The verification of derived
    irrigation strategies by conducting experiments was successful. Achieved were
    high, ranging from to , with equally successful values of for both irrigation
    strategies. On top of that, some of the investigated treatments resulted in considerable
    water savings despite achieving similar . Using pF-meters for monitoring soil
    water potentials and for controlling irrigation was successful and proved to be
    promising for future applications (Kloss et al. 2014). Using irrigation thresholds
    beyond the range of commonly used tensiometers is not only feasible, but also
    worth further exploring. First conclusions could be drawn on factors governing
    the behavior of the irrigation system for both irrigation strategies on overall
    water consumption and WP. However, due to the limitations of the conducted experiment
    with its restricted number of treatments and plants per container, future work
    should concentrate on deriving statistically sound conclusions and generalizing
    findings. In addition, experiments under real field conditions have to be considered,
    which is already under study in cooperation with the Agricultural Research Center,
    Oman. As a precondition, reliable and robust estimates of crop growth parameters
    and soil hydraulic properties (Werisch et al. 2014) are needed. Additional efforts
    for evaluating model suitability and transferability across different climatic
    and geographic regions are required. Approaches of two-dimensional soil water
    transport and soil variability may be included. Nevertheless, the combination
    of SVAT-modeling and optimization has the potential to systematically investigate
    and improve irrigation systems, while reducing otherwise necessary experiments.

    Get rights and content Abstract The efficient irrigation systems require key soil
    parameters, field capacity, and wilting point to estimate the maximum soil water
    holding capacity. The present study employs the inverse modeling method to determine
    the soil water contents at field capacity and wilting point through utilization
    of near-surface satellite soil moisture. The study also compares the field capacity
    and wilting point as obtained from the soil hydraulic parameters based on Rosetta
    pedotransfer functions. Efficiency is improved with reduction in root mean square
    error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) in estimating the soil water retention
    curve by the optimized method as compared to pedotransfer function. These parameters
    were then used as input parameters in the HYDRUS-1D model along with integration
    of tropical rainfall measuring mission rainfall data set and the results of observed
    and simulated soil water contents were compared. It was found that the optimized
    parameters were able to simulate the soil water contents with RMSE in the range
    of 0.03–0.07 and MBE in the range of 0.03–0.23 for all the depths during both
    calibration and validation. However, with pedotransfer-based parameters the RMSE
    and MBE were found in the range of 0.11–0.15 and 0.69–1.03, respectively. References

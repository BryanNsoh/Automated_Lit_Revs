  explanation: 'This study analyzes the irrigation water requirement of wheat grown
    in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) and predicts that the uncertainty associated
    with this requirement is largely driven by the selection of the evapotranspiration
    (ET) method, with the parametric uncertainty introduced by crop coefficients (Kc)
    playing a secondary role. The authors suggest using an ensemble of methods to
    represent structural and parametric uncertainty and using the reliability ensemble
    averaging (REA) technique to reduce the predictive uncertainty and provide a robust
    estimate of the irrigation water requirement.


    The authors found that the six ET equations they evaluated exhibited substantial
    variability in their estimates of ET, with the Priestley-Taylor (PT) and Penman-Monteith
    Point (PPET) methods giving the highest estimates and the Penman-Monteith 56 (PM56),
    Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Areal Potential ET (APET), and Turc methods giving lower
    estimates. The choice of Kc set had a smaller effect on the predicted irrigation
    water requirement compared to the choice of ET method.


    The authors then applied the REA technique to reduce predictive uncertainty, resulting
    in a decrease in the predicted irrigation water requirement and its uncertainty
    range. They also found that the REA-derived irrigation water requirement was less
    likely to exceed a given threshold, indicating that REA can help in defining thresholds
    for irrigation planning and decision-making.'

- explanation: 'The systematic literature review focused on assessing the application
    of deep learning (DL) methods in crop yield prediction using remote sensing (RS)
    data. It highlights the potential of DL for crop yield prediction, addresses challenges,
    and discusses strategies for overcoming limitations.


    DL approaches have shown promise in crop yield prediction due to their ability
    to learn complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been widely used
    for this purpose. LSTMs have proven particularly effective in modeling temporal
    sequences, which is crucial for crop yield prediction given the time-dependent
    nature of plant growth and yield formation.


    While DL methods have demonstrated high accuracy, challenges remain. One challenge
    is the lack of interpretability and explainability in DL models, making it difficult
    to understand the underlying factors influencing predictions. Furthermore, the
    effectiveness of DL models can be limited by the availability of high-quality
    and representative RS data. Additionally, computational resource requirements
    and the need for specialized expertise can pose challenges for practical implementation.


    To address these challenges, researchers are exploring strategies such as data
    augmentation to enhance data diversity, transfer learning to leverage knowledge
    gained from related tasks, and ensemble methods to improve model robustness. The
    use of explainable AI techniques is gaining attention to enhance the transparency
    and interpretability of DL models. Collaborative efforts between researchers,

  data_sources: Data from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) and the Australian
    National Water Commission
  explanation: The study conducted by Wildman and Forde (2012) examines the current
    policy for managing water shortages in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) and evaluates
    the viability of an interstate water market as a potential reform. The study focuses
    on the Shortage Guidelines, which represent the current policy for responding
    to low water levels in the basin's main reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
    The authors argue that the Shortage Guidelines are a stopgap solution that provides
    insufficient incentives for water conservation and places the burden of shortage
    disproportionately on certain states. As an alternative, they propose an interstate
    water market, similar to the one implemented in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin,
    as a potential reform to address water scarcity in the CRB.
  extract_1: An optimally efficient water market is one in which trading of water
    rights allows each user to get as much water as it is willing to buy and for each
    user to pay for the true value of the water it receives (Freebairn, 2003).
  extract_2: Preserving seniority of water rights should make interstate water trading
    attractive to senior rights holders across the CRB due to the strong potential
    for profit. Coupled with the access to new sources of water for junior rights
    holders, it may make interstate water trading more universally appealing across
    the Basin.

    insufficient incentives for water conservation and places the burden of shortage
    disproportionately on certain states.


    * An interstate water market could be a viable reform to address water scarcity
    in the CRB, as it would allow for more efficient and equitable allocation of water
    resources.

    Molle et al. (1999) reported that mango orchards in Thailand are receiving 20
    pesticide treatments and 5 fertilizer applications per season. Despite growing
    attention in irrigated orchards to leaking root zones, in general during the last
    decades, knowledge on evapotranspiration–percolation relationships is nevertheless
    limited. Thus the environmental impact of non-consumed irrigation water requires
    more attention. This paper addresses Ea measurements which, in conjunction with
    soil moisture storage changes, and rainfall, allow the isolation of percolation
    fluxes (instead of deriving Ea from percolation estimates, we assess percolation
    from Ea estimates). The general objective of this study was to find useful recommendations
    for a rational and strategic water management in irrigated mango orchards. The
    specific objectives of this study are \n• The evaluation of the performance of
    the eddy covariance technique for measuring actual evapotranspiration for tropical
    fruits. \n• Assessment of daily and seasonal mango evapotranspiration and related
    crop water parameters for two complete growing seasons having different rainfall

  explanation: 'This article describes the application of telecontrol data to analyze
    irrigation system efficiency and water management practices for individual farmers,
    on a crop-by-crop basis, in the Candasnos irrigation district of northeastern
    Spain. It is part of a larger study to evaluate the use of automated irrigation
    technologies and strategies to improve water management and increase agricultural
    productivity.


    The article begins by summarizing the overall goals of the larger study, which
    are:


    1. To explore the potential of automated irrigation management systems to improve
    efficiency and productivity.

    2. To assess the current state of end-to-end automated irrigation management systems.

    3. To identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the
    automated irrigation management system, from data collection to automated action.

    4. To highlight the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the
    integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

    5. To identify challenges and propose solutions for fully autonomous, scalable
    irrigation management.

    6. To guide future research and innovation in the field of real-time, automated
    irrigation management.


    The article then narrows its focus to the specific methods and results of the
    portion of the study that was conducted in the Candasnos irrigation district.
    The authors used telecontrol systems and crop water requirement data to analyze
    the irrigation performance (SIPI) of maize, alfalfa, and stone fruits. They found
    that:


    1. The average SIPI of maize, alfalfa, and peach was 83, 107, and 123%, respectively.

    2. Deficit irrigation practices were conducted on peach trees, but not in accordance
    with the recommended regulated deficit irrigation strategy.

    3. There was high variability in SIPI among farmers, indicating that irrigation
    management strategies could be improved.

    4. Telecontrol data could be used to improve irrigation management at the plot
    level by providing real-time information on irrigation performance and by facilitating
    the adoption of deficit irrigation strategies.


    The authors conclude by emphasizing the potential value of telecontrol data for
    improving irrigation management and water use efficiency in agricultural systems.'

  data_sources: Survey data, Interviews, Case studies, Literature review
  explanation: Kaur, Hazrati Fard, Amiri-Zarandi, and Dara shed light on the looming
    concerns farmers have over data privacy and how policies and standards that are
    already in place, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, can be used
    to protect farmers and their data. They also discuss how farmers can protect themselves
    and their data through direct action. They suggest farmers enhance their digital
    literacy and take steps to safeguard themselves against phishing and other cyberattacks.
    Lastly, they discuss data agreements and how farmers should read these agreements
    carefully and seek clarification on anything they don't understand so that they
    know exactly how their data is being used.
  extract_1: '"With the recent technological advancements, farming has been signiﬁcantly
    transformed by the adoption of so-called precision agriculture. Precision agriculture
    uses innovative technology such as sensors, drones, robots, precision machinery,
    and GPS technology to help farmers increase productivity, sustainability, and
    proﬁtability (Monteiro et al., 2021). These digital agricultural technologies
    use large amounts of data from multiple sources to improve the use of farming
    resources such as fertilizers, pesticide applications, and livestock health and
    welfare."'

    concerns about privacy of farm data. Privacy is deﬁned as the right of an individual
    to control or inﬂuence what information related to them is collected, how that
    data are stored and used, and with whom they are shared or disclosed (Linsner
    et al., 2021).


    However, farmers are usually not informed about the purpose of data collection
    from the farm, how their data is used, and whether their data is shared with the
    third parties (Linsner et al., 2021). Due to the lack of control and lack of transparency,

    farming.


    The paper emphasizes the importance of strategies to encourage widespread adoption
    of standards and best practices for interoperability in automated irrigation systems.'
  extract_1: With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network
    of smart devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of
    Things (IoT), allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared
    data among each other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications.
    In smart farming, as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates
    edge and physical layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them
    to interact with the cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer
    sensor communication system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data
    stores through high speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer
    about corp quality via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a
    means of communication to bind all other layers.
  extract_2: Although moving data processing and analytics to the edge enhances agility
    and efficiency, to say the least, it also imposes huge security risks due to the
    increased attack surface primarily because of the highly diverse use of IoT devices
    which are usually not built with security in mind. This gives attackers an easy
    entry point to the network since remote access to the edge layer, in most cases,
    is essential.

  key_findings: The paper finds that the growing use of IoT devices and data-driven
    applications in smart farming has raised security and privacy issues, and that
    there is a need for strategies to encourage widespread adoption of standards and
    best practices for interoperability in automated irrigation systems.

    sensing, irrigation suitability, and statistical data for irrigated cropland mapping
    over mainland China. Journal of Hydrology, 613(A), 128413.
  explanation: The novelty of the proposed method for mapping irrigated croplands
    lies in the incorporation of irrigation suitability into the process. The method
    consists of three major steps including irrigation suitability analysis, training
    pool generation based on suitability-adjusted vegetation indices and irrigated
    area statistics, and machine learning-based classification of irrigated and rainfed
    croplands.
  extract_1: To address the above gaps, this study proposes a novel approach to develop
    the first 250-m irrigated cropland map in mainland China (CIrrMap250) for the
    year 2000 by integrating remote sensing, irrigation suitability, and irrigated
    area statistics.
  extract_2: The major difference between our approach and other existing methods
    lies in the incorporation irrigation suitability into the mapping process.
  inline_citation: (Zhang et al., 2022)
  limitations: First, the proposed irrigation mapping method depends heavily on irrigated
    area statistics. Although the statistical irrigated areas were collected and reconstructed
    with an unprecedented level of detail in our study, they inevitably have some
    uncertainties and inconsistences (Ajaz et al., 2019). Furthermore, the statistics
    represent the effective irrigated area, i.e., the area equipped for irrigation,
    rather than the actual irrigated area, which may lead to biased results.
  relevance_evaluation: This study has important implications for the management of
    irrigated agriculture and water resources in China. By developing a more accurate
    and detailed map of irrigated croplands, the study can help policymakers target
    irrigation investments and improve water-use efficiency, which is crucial for
    sustainable agricultural development in a water-scarce country like China.

    \ which IoT technologies may facilitate the implementation of circular business\
    \ models (CBM). They discovered that IoT can improve the implementation of CBM\
    \ in a variety of ways, encompassing: (1) enhancing resource utilization through\

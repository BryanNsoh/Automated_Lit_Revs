  data_sources: Agro-meteorological parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity,

    distributed heterogeneous sensing systems.
  explanation: This study assesses the relevance of Sawant et al. (2017) to the point
    in the literature review that discusses challenges in adopting and implementing

    review argue that a lack of standardization hinders the integration of data from
    various distributed sensor networks, making it difficult to answer questions like
    "What is the crop water requirement during a particular crop growth stage?" Sawant
    et al. (2017) address this challenge by proposing a sensor platform (hardware)
    with integrated Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) architecture for precision agro-meteorological
    monitoring. They also demonstrate the utility of such interoperable sensing systems
    for agro-meteorological monitoring and potential evapotranspiration estimation.

  explanation: "The authors start by providing a concise overview of how the development\
    \ of Big Data in the context of precision agriculture has been given considerable\
    \ attention in recent literature. They note that the intersection of big data\
    \ and precision agriculture has enabled solutions for increasing food security,\

    \ to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and\
    \ future potential of real-time, automated irrigation management systems and their\
    \ integration. They plan to achieve this objective by utilizing a conceptual framework\
    \ that examines socio-economic impacts, which they describe as missing from most\
    \ other literature reviews on this topic.\n\nThe authors then outline the methodology\
    \ for conducting the review, which involved searching two major bibliographical\
    \ databases, Web of Science and Scopus, using relevant keywords and inclusion\
    \ criteria. They also included grey literature, such as conference proceedings,\
    \ magazine articles, blogs, and web items in English, into their review. The authors\
    \ assessed the relevance of each item using a combination of title and content\
    \ analysis.\n\nThe authors provide a detailed description of the conceptual framework\
    \ used for the review, which draws upon literature on chain network management\
    \ and data-driven strategies, and classifies the elements of the model into business\
    \ processes, network management, and network management technology.\n\nThe authors\
    \ then present their findings on the current state of Big Data and precision agriculture,\
    \ including the drivers for Big Data in this domain, such as improving profitability,\
    \ efficiency, and decision-making. They also discuss the challenges in adopting\
    \ and implementing standards across diverse hardware and software platforms, which\
    \ they identify as one of the main barriers to the integration of automated systems\

    \nFinally, the authors provide a list of conclusions and recommendations based\

    \ in scope and organization, including the introduction of new business models,\
    \ the reduction of agricultural labor due to further automation, and the empowerment\

    \ challenges need to be addressed including, but not limited to:\n    * Data ownership,\
    \ privacy, and security issues\n    * Data quality, which has always been a key\
    \ issue in farm management information systems, but is more challenging with big,\
    \ real-time data\n    * Intelligent processing and analytics, which is more challenging\
    \ because of the large amount of often unstructured, heterogeneous data which\
    \ requires a smart interplay between skilled data scientists, domain experts,\
    \ and machine learning/AI engineers\n    * Sustainable integration of Big Data\
    \ sources, which is crucial for the success of any business model and so must\
    \ be done in a financially and environmentally sustainable manner\n    * Business\
    \ models that are attractive enough for precision agriculture solution providers\
    \ but that also enable a fair share between the different stakeholders\n    *\
    \ Openness of platforms that will accelerate solution development and innovation\
    \ in general, but also empower farmers within supply chains\n4. While there are\

    196, 106897.
  data_sources:
  - Sensor data
  explanation: The paper presents a WSN-based beehive monitoring platform developed
    using a microservices architecture, which improves the sustainability of beekeeping
    activities through enhanced integration, interoperability, scalability, agility,
    reliability, maintainability, responsiveness, availability, and interoperability.
    The developed platform provides data collection, transmission, and processing
    functionalities, and makes the collected data available in various open formats
    to support decision-making by stakeholders in the beekeeping domain.
  extract_1: The proposed WSN-based beehive monitoring platform has been developed
    using microservices architecture within the scope of this paper. There are a great
    deal of motivations behind adopting microservices architecture in the developed
    system. Despite there are many useful characteristics of microservices architecture,
    we shall point out how to utilize its essential characteristics for the proposed
    beehive monitoring systems and discuss how we contribute to the body of knowledge.
  extract_2: The developed WSN-based Beehive Monitoring Platform is heterogeneous
    in respect to operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, data storage
    options, communication protocols, and client applications. For instance, four
    different operating systems (OS), three different programming languages, and two
    database systems have been used within the developed system. A particular server
    operating system (Windows Server 2016) has been used for hosting the microservices
    and web applications.

    and processing functionalities, and makes the collected data available in various
    open formats to support decision-making by stakeholders in the beekeeping domain.
  limitations: The study has successfully demonstrated how to adopt microservices
    architecture to WSN-based Beehive Monitoring Platform; however, it has certain
    limitations in terms of making use of generated data in different open formats
    for different stakeholders. Stakeholder and user perspectives are utmost importance
    to any system which exhibits new features like the proposed system. As such, the
    stakeholder perspective can be addressed as a matter of an appropriate business
    model, platform strategy, or open platform governance model. Regarding the user
    perspectives, one needs to examine further an extent to which the proposed system
    is adopted in real-world settings. More specifically, it would be valuable to
    compare experiences of application developers in handling collected and published
    sensor data in different open formats. Considerably more work will be needed to
    adjust and visualize the open sensor data to provide a compact system architecture
    for the beekeeping domain. A greater focus on analyzing open sensor data could
    generate interesting findings that contribute more to the solution of common issues
    concerning the beekeeping domain.

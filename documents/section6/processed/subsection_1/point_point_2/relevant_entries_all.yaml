    IEEE Conference Location: Maynooth, Ireland SECTION I. Introduction The important
    elements for any closed -loop process control can be simplified to the following
    blocks which are; input, processor, feedback and output, simply illustrated in
    Fig 1. Fig 1: Elements in a closed-loop process control Show All The control blocks
    (elements) shown in Fig 1 can be assumed as different technologies from different
    manufacturers. Controlling these completely different systems without a standard
    communicating protocol is highly difficult. This concept can be applied to any
    process and in any domain. This problem has been acknowledged by international
    professional societies who have over time standardized some of the communication
    protocols to leverage the benefits of interoperability. When adopted, these standard
    protocols not only work with different subsystems of the same vendor but with
    different vendors subsystems as well. This has led to flexible and tailored automated
    process controls. This idea has been adopted in precision farming for more sustainable
    and profitable farming practices. However, due to the vast number of unpredictable
    and uncontrollable factors like climate, soil and crop health, the control is
    limited. Currently, the control is especially limited for mobile farm machinery
    used for seeding/planting, variable rate spraying/spreading and harvesting. For
    seamless farm management, factors like plant and soil health, nutrients, moisture,
    climate etc. should also be considered for continuous adaption with a feedback
    mechanism. Though there are technologies available to monitor these factors, they
    are not unified or integrated, which is a shortcoming in Agriculture 4.0. Scope
    of This Paper This paper discusses the technologies, standards and their adoption
    which have paved the way for Industry 4.0. Also discussed are the advancements
    in precision farming and the challenges to fill the gap in closing the loop for
    automated control. The benefits of agronomic benchmarking when the standard technologies
    are adopted are discussed. Finally, standardization of protocols and unified architecture
    for Agriculture 4.0 to monitor and control the processes are proposed. SECTION
    II. The Success of Industry 4.0 The evolved term ‘Industry 4.0’ refers to any
    industrial manufacturing or assembly plant/factory of any domain which has adopted
    some level of automation in their processes using cyber-physical systems. This
    dates back to the early 1970s where pneumatic and hydraulic actuators were controlled
    by programmable logic controllers (PLCs) [1]. As companies scaled up, it became
    difficult to manage the individual PLCs and other control interfaces. This problem
    has been solved with SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and DCS
    (Distributed Control System) which represents the data and control at a higher
    level or HMI (Human Machine Interface) [2]. The intermediate layer between HMI
    and controlled surfaces is the communication layer. The communication between
    controlled surfaces and the controlling units forms a network. The lower part
    of the network (shown in Fig 2) which interacts with controlled devices is called
    the Fieldbus (in an industrial context). Fig 2: Connecting various networks in
    an industry setup [2] Show All The development of OSI (Open System Interconnect)
    has encouraged the industrial protocol developers to adhere to the standard communication
    protocols which have led to cable redundancy cost cuts. Various European countries
    like Germany, France and Denmark have developed their own industrial protocols
    which can be deployed in industrial automation. Their protocols are different
    from each other which has made it tough to standardize into one single standard.
    This resulted in maintaining different types of fieldbuses namely PROFIBUS [3],
    FIP [4], P-NET [5], WFIP [6]–[8], etc. as their national standards. The International
    Electrotechnical Commission published IEC 61158 with the above protocols as the
    standard protocols [9]. Companies themselves have come to devise innovative protocols
    which access the medium with a single set of cables. These include CSMA-CA (Carrier
    Sense Multiple Access - Collision Avoidance) [10], CAN (Control Area Network)
    [11] etc. Later, the development of wireless technologies like the WLAN (Wireless
    Local Area Network) standard, industrial sensor vendors have modified the OSI
    Model''s physical layer and kept the network layer and medium access layers similar.
    This has helped to modify different types of fieldbuses to adopt wireless technology.
    Similarly, the adoption of other wireless standards like Bluetooth and ZigBee
    have given rise to many wireless communication options to the industry. The adoption
    of these converged technologies by the vendors and end users has led to flexible,
    decentralized and cost-effective end-to-end automation in the industry today.
    In addition, adoption of IoT to help connect manufacturing plants in separate
    geographic locations as a single entity is a reality [12], [13]. This can be considered
    a success of ‘Industry 4.0’ technology. SECTION III. Process in An Agricultural
    Context In analogy to industry, the process in agriculture is viewed as the product
    undergoing changes in various stages from the primary stage to the final stage
    as a consumable product. Here the product can be seen as a seed in the primary
    stage, developing into a final consumable entity cultivated through intermediary
    stages. This is shown in Fig 3. Fig 3: Process stages in agriculture Show All
    As in industry, these stages require a lot of human intervention to monitor and
    supply adequate nutrients and care is taken to ensure proper crop growth. To increase
    yield, the fertilizers are spread. However, in order to efficiently manage the
    crop, the health of the soil and plants must be considered. This can be done if
    the plants and soil are closely monitored. Precision Farming mostly makes use
    of GPS (Global Positioning System), remote sensing, soil mapping, and variable
    rate technology (VRT) [14], which have enabled farm machinery to guide and precisely
    (up to a few centimetres accuracy) spray/spread fertilizer/nutrients. Similarly,
    in the Harvest stage, yield mapping and other parameters are considered and analysed.
    This is shown in Fig 4. Currently, precision farming is limited to only certain
    stages in the whole process. For continuous monitoring of the crop, sensors which
    constantly monitor soil parameters like moisture, pH, nutrient contents and plant
    health must be installed. Once the user is aware of these parameters, better control
    can be achieved. Currently, soil sampling and measuring plant nutrition (measuring
    chlorophyll) are done manually with the sensors in between the stages and these
    data are correlated with the fertilizer/nutrient spread/spray. Fig 4: Dry yield
    data overlay on a map Show All Currently, the process monitoring is also not seamless
    in agriculture, which hinders progress in achieving the ‘Agriculture 4.0’ scenario.
    SECTION IV. Challenges in Agriculture 4.0 In the Industry 4.0 ecosystem ‘almost’
    every stage can be controlled with human intervention. In analogy, the bio-ecosystem
    depends on various uncontrollable factors like climate. The only way to control
    the process is to adapt to these factors and maintain productivity. In addition,
    getting the process feedback or tracing is extremely difficult because of the
    vast spatio temporal nature of the farms. Unlike an industrial setting, conditions
    in agriculture can be very harsh. Due to extreme open weather conditions and soil
    nature, it is difficult to procure and install sensors which are rugged and able
    to measure key indicators of crop growth. This is vital for a feedback mechanism
    to adapt to the conditions. Industry standards are not compatible with this scenario.
    There are no sensor vendors who exclusively solve this problem and no standards
    like Fieldbus exist. However, processes can be monitored in some of the stages
    like fertilizer/nutrient spread/spray season. The nitrogen sensor or NDVI sensor
    mounted on farm machinery helps in variable rate application in real-time. Satellite
    imagery helps to monitor the vegetation index but is not always suitable for real-time
    monitoring because of cloud cover and poor signals [15]. Lack of integrated systems,
    interoperable skills and basic information about the land and nutrient spread
    [16] add up to challenges which make crop management extremely difficult. These
    challenges are relevant research and engineering areas. Once these gaps are bridged,
    there is a good possibility for seamless adaptive control over the farms. SECTION
    V. Agronomic Benchmarking and Sensor Standardization To overcome the challenges
    mentioned in section IV, agronomic benchmarking is necessary as a reference. Benchmarking
    on the use of nutrients on the field exists today as a compliance/regulation in
    some countries for accountability [17]. Similarly, an economic benchmarking on
    crop productivity and health is needed to compare the benefits of a fully-integrated
    system against conventional farm practices. To achieve this, farms are divided
    and cultivated separately with the fully-integrated method and conventional method
    throughout the crop seasons (up to crop yield) and compared against soil reusability,
    quality of the produce, quantity of the produce and economic savings. This helps
    farmers and contractors compare methodologies and view potential ways to adapt
    to these integrated systems. Studies have shown that some farmers violate the
    regulations in nutrient management despite the efforts put in place by the regulatory
    authorities [18]. Tracking these violations is very difficult as they have to
    rely on statistical analysis of administrative data. Using an integrated system
    will aid the regulatory agencies and food safety authorities [19], [20] to easily
    track and trace the nutrients and other toxic substances and enforce permissible
    limits. Similar to industrial sensors, agri based sensors, farm machinery and
    communication protocols (like ISOBUS) have to be standardized and reviewed once
    every five years and certified similar to other industrial standards. This encourages
    and enables sensor, machinery manufacturers and protocol stack developers to develop
    suitable devices, machines and other agri based communication protocols respectively
    to create a competitive scenario. SECTION VI. Unified Architecture There is a
    need for a full-fledged Management Information System (MIS) exclusively for Crop
    management similar to FMIS (Farm Management Information Systems) [21], [22]. This
    includes monitoring from the primary stage to the final consumable stage and external
    factors like weather forecasting. This will provide better adaptive control (decision
    making) over crops. There are some farm simulator packages like GRAZPLAN [23]
    for pasture simulation, APSIM [24] agricultural production simulation and decision
    support system like GPFARM [25] which help in getting rough estimations and decision
    support but, it is very difficult to generalize these systems for all types of
    farm practices. Farm-specific models are much easier for farmers to adopt [26]
    as they need less configuration. Similarly, a real-time unified architecture is
    needed which takes the seasonal information and attributes affecting crop yield
    and have control on the agricultural production. Currently, the systems we have
    on farm machinery log data of particular operations like spreading, spraying and
    harvesting but there is no mechanism to co-relate these data. Manual testing for
    plant and soil data, aerial imagery and other sources are not integrated because
    of various factors such as differences in data formats, incompatible device ports
    and differences in communication protocols from different vendors. This makes
    monitoring and analyzing of agricultural data very difficult. Research and development
    is needed from the lowest layer, investigating water and dirt proof rugged sensors
    which sense soil quality and plant health. A new type of scouting system (aerial
    or land-based) with suitable sensors will help. A new type of fieldbus is required
    to cater to the requirements of open crop cultivation. To integrate different
    types of data streams, a unified architecture is needed which represents data
    in a simple meaningful manner relating to crop growth. These data streams include
    continuous soil sampling which monitors pH, moisture and nutrient content. Continuous
    plant health analysis like chlorophyll content, nutrient intake, insect or disease
    manifestations. Variable Fertilizer/Nutrient spread/spray data, weather data,
    overall vegetation index from the satellite imagery, harvest data, etc. All these
    data streams should be linked to the geographical coordinates of where the sampling
    took place. This can act as a complete feedback mechanism in the agricultural
    process but this can only be possible if all the data streams are integrated into
    one single software platform. Various studies have acknowledged the benefits of
    a unified architecture or framework for agriculture and IoT. Some of them have
    presented the architecture layer by layer [27] [28]. Some agri-IoT [29] frameworks
    are adopted from smart city framework concepts [30]. This integrated farm data
    (Big Data) [31], [32] can be used for analyzing the trends with respect to factors
    affecting the yield over time (hindsight). A wide variety of robust database systems
    are available today. A selection of databases which support a wide variety of
    scalable data formats is crucial in any decision support system. Machine Learning
    models can be trained with these myriad data and predict the optimum parameters
    for the next season. These predictions are evaluated against the ground truth
    to improve the accuracy of predictions. A real-time adaptation testing is also
    conducted to evaluate how these models adapt to the dynamic changes. This unified
    architecture will bridge the gaps in the loop and eventually the whole process
    can be automated in compliance with agronomic benchmarking. The proposed unified
    architecture is shown in figure 5. Data collected from a suite of on-farm sensors,
    weather stations, farm machinery sensor data, etc. are stored locally corresponding
    to one farm. These data can be linked to an internet gateway which links to a
    central crop database or cloud infrastructure. This central database or cloud
    platform may integrate with other useful information sources to share or retrieve
    data. These sources may include Food and Safety Authorities database, National
    census database, etc. Relevant information from different sources is combined
    and visualized to get meaningful insights into the farm in terms of crop health,
    quality, regulatory compliance and economy. The data from the central database
    consisting of a variety of data formats (structured, semi -structured, unstructured)
    are retrieved to develop machine learning/predictive models. In recent years,
    machine learning models have proved to be good in classifying, recommending and
    predicting multi-model entities [33], [34]. These machine learning models are
    evaluated and the recommended farm tasks are ranked. The highly ranked farm recommender
    setting will be sent to the specific farm controller network for initialising
    specific equipment. The controller network communicates with the local on-farm
    gateway and control unit. The control unit makes sure the farm equipment are safe
    and ready to proceed. These on-farm control actions may include water sprinkler
    systems to maintain moisture, drone/land-based scouting to check crop/plant health,
    commanding autonomous farm machinery [35], [36] to spray/spread pesticides/fertilizers
    at the right location and right amount. Fig 5: A proposed unified architecture.
    Show All This creates a data-driven loop in an agricultural context which can
    deliver great value for farmers and government bodies in terms of traceable, sustainable
    and profitable farming. SECTION VII. Conclusion This paper highlighted the success
    of industry 4.0 by discussing the technology and factors for wide adoption. It
    had attempted to compare the processes in agriculture to those in an industrial
    context and has highlighted the challenges. It is better to have a reference model
    to compare agricultural dynamics. This paper has discussed the agronomic benchmarking
    from regulation enforcement and food safety authorities to be taken as a reference
    for any ethical agricultural practice. Finally, a unified architecture has been
    proposed. It is really hard to predict outcomes and maintain control required
    in the wildly changing agricultural dynamics of the real world. Though there are
    IoT enabled smart farms which gather data about crop affecting factors, the decision
    making is still at a human level which varies greatly in terms of productivity,
    quality, re-usability and economy. The proposed architecture will bridge the gap
    in collecting relevant data as a feedback mechanism and controlling the factors
    affecting the output. The trends are analytically evaluated (also including historical
    data if available) and visualized for better insights. Additionally, the control/process
    tasks are recommended by the machine learning predictive models. It is envisaged
    that the proposed architecture will bridge the loop of the agricultural process
    by adapting to the changes, tactically predicting the outcomes and recommending
    control measures. As a long-term plan, with some add-ons to this proposed architecture,
    it is possible to gather data from similar crops at multiple locations to a central
    (national) food census repository. The exciting part starts from that point to
    train the machine learning models and control multiple farms from a single control
    centre. With some research and development, it is possible to connect this service
    to autonomous agricultural machinery and drones paving a way for advanced agriculture
    5.0 This research creates a new dimension in the field of engineering and a wide
    variety of opportunities to achieve ethical, sustainable and profitable farming.

  description: The agricultural machinery produces an increasing number of measurements
    during operations. The primary use of these measurements is to control agricultural
    operations on the farm. Data that describes the in-field variation in plant growth
    potential and growing conditions is the basis for precision farming. The secondary
    use for the gathered information is documentation of work and work performance
    for business purposes. Researcher also benefits from the increasing measurement
    capabilities. Biologists and agronomists can model the crops and agronomic phenomena.
    Work scientists can analyse the agricultural work processes. And finally, machines
    with additional accurate sensors can be used for agricultural machine product
    development and technological research purposes. This paper concentrates on an
    independent research data collection platform (Cropinfra) which can be used to
    collect data for all above mentioned purposes. Data can be collected both from
    ISOBUS (ISO 11783) compliant machines as well as older and proprietary systems
    and stored to database for further analysis. The farm machines in Cropinfra are
    supplemented with extra sensors that are more accurate than existing in commercial
    machines. Therefore, the Cropinfra can be used as a reference measurement system
    to verify the correct operation of the machines as well as to produce data for
    biological research purposes. This paper will also present how the cloud connection
    of the data collection system can be realized. The solution was designed to be
    compatible with the existing ISO 11783-10 standard. The examples presented in
    this paper verify that the solution works in real farming environment. The data
    has been used in numerous research projects already, and in the future the data
    will be an important asset when machine learning and other artificial intelligence
    methods will be studied and utilized.

    primary use of these measurements is to control agricultural operations on the
    farm. Data that describes the in-field variation in plant growth potential and
    growing conditions is the basis for precision farming. The secondary use for the
    gathered information is documentation of work and work performance for business
    purposes. Researcher also benefits from the increasing measurement capabilities.
    Biologists and agronomists can model the crops and agronomic phenomena. Work scientists
    can analyse the agricultural work processes. And finally, machines with additional
    accurate sensors can be used for agricultural machine product development and
    technological research purposes. This paper concentrates on an independent research
    data collection platform (Cropinfra) which can be used to collect data for all
    above mentioned purposes. Data can be collected both from ISOBUS (ISO 11783) compliant
    machines as well as older and proprietary systems and stored to database for further
    analysis. The farm machines in Cropinfra are supplemented with extra sensors that
    are more accurate than existing in commercial machines. Therefore, the Cropinfra
    can be used as a reference measurement system to verify the correct operation
    of the machines as well as to produce data for biological research purposes. This
    paper will also present how the cloud connection of the data collection system
    can be realized. The solution was designed to be compatible with the existing
    ISO 11783-10 standard. The examples presented in this paper verify that the solution
    works in real farming environment. The data has been used in numerous research
    projects already, and in the future the data will be an important asset when machine
    learning and other artificial intelligence methods will be studied and utilized.

    platformData captureData transfer 1. Introduction Agricultural machinery has gone
    through significant changes during last decades. The introduction of electronic
    control units (ECU) has opened up new ways for carrying out agricultural operations
    (Stone et al., 2008). Especially the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)
    based solutions enable position based precision farming (Thomasson et al., 2019).
    At the same time the sensors and other measurement devices have also developed
    tremendously and their unit price has come down (SACHS, 2014). Agricultural machinery
    produces an increasing number of measurements during operations. This information
    can be used for many purposes. One primary purpose is to use data gathered to
    control agricultural operations. Soil conditions, crop growth and health can be
    monitored and used to make fertilization and plant protection decisions and prescription
    maps for precision farming operations (Söderström et al., 2016). Another use for
    the information is documentation of work and work performance for business purposes.
    For example, an agricultural contractor can verify the work they have carried
    out by showing the measurement data to the customer (Suonentieto, 2019, Dataväxt,
    2019). In addition to the land owners and farmers, researchers can also benefit
    from the increasing measurement capabilities. Biologists and agronomists can model
    crops and agronomic phenomena, verify hypotheses and produce new knowledge (Kaivosoja
    et al., 2013). Machinery data is an important source of so called big data in
    agriculture (Wolfert et al., 2017). Also work scientists can analyse the agricultural
    work processes in more detail. And finally, machines with additional and accurate
    sensors can be used for Product development of agricultural machinery and technological
    research purposes (Öhman et al., 2004, Suomi and Oksanen, 2015) Data can be collected
    from the machinery using a number of different ways. The existing electronic control
    units (ECUs) can create their own proprietary logs, which can be downloaded to
    USB stick or, in some cases, to cloud servers. Another way is to use an independent
    logging unit which does the same, but is not directly bundled with any manufacturer’s
    control units. In both cases, the data collection includes four phases: measurement
    devices or sensors, data capture, data transfer, and data storage. However, the
    last two phases of the process can be fundamentally different depending on the
    technology used. Farms can be very heterogeneous, as the history of the farm,
    the geography of the land used by the farm, the crops and livestock grown on the
    farm, as well as technological capability and business strategy of the farm all
    affect how the farm works. The type of production and the size of the farm define
    the type and size of machinery required. Furthermore, farm’s machinery is often
    a mixture of older and newer machines from a number of manufacturers. Rarely any
    manufacturer can provide all machines, devices and software that the farmer needs.
    Therefore there is a strong need for compatibility between different brands. In
    agriculture the communication between different components in tractor-implement
    system is defined by the commonly agreed standard ISO 11783 (ISO, 2017a, ISO,
    2017b) – marketed under the name ISOBUS (AEF, 2019a). The Agricultural Electronic
    Industry Foundation (AEF) develops and markets the ISOBUS system. In the previous
    research projects the information management of farm machinery and the data transfer
    from the machinery to farm management information systems (FMIS) and various on–
    and off-site services has been studied. Fountas et al. (2015) have proposed a
    Farm Machinery Management Information System based on interviews of tractor operators
    and farm managers. The solution was presented as a rich picture from which a conceptual
    model for conventional farm machinery and agricultural robots was developed. Steinberger
    et al. (2009) have presented a prototype implementation of ISO 11783 task controller
    without user interface for data logging. The data was stored in ISO XML format
    in a PDA and transferred to a local storage using WLAN. For telemetry purposes
    feasibility of OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) technology to transfer ISO 11783
    related process data between farm machinery and the internet was studied by Oksanen
    et al. (2015). Oksanen et al. presented also an approach to convert ISO 11783
    DDOP (Device Description Object Pool) to OPC UA information model. In the experiments
    the latency and bandwidth usage of communication were measured and found feasible.
    Commercial solutions for data collection exist from all major farm machinery manufacturers.
    For example AGCO has AgCommand, John Deere has JDLink, CLAAS has TONI, etc. There
    exist also retrofittable fleet management and telemetry solutions from different
    manufacturers, for example Suonentieto AgriSmart, Wapice IoT-Ticket, etc. Currently
    the ISOBUS working group at AEF is working on a standard for data transfer between
    ISOBUS-compatible machinery and farm management systems (AEF, 2019b). The standard
    is expected to be ready for use during the year 2019. This paper concentrates
    on an independent research data collection platform (Cropinfra) which can be used
    to collect data both form ISOBUS compliant machines as well as old and proprietary
    systems and store the data to database for further analysis. The farm machines
    in Cropinfra are supplemented with extra sensors that are more accurate than those
    existing in commercial machines. Therefore the Cropinfra can be used as a reference
    measurement system to verify the correct operation of the machine. The Cropinfra
    has developed in many national and international research projects starting from
    2003 (Fig. 1). The Cropinfra platform is a concept for future farm’s data collection
    and management structure that is capable to serve also research purposes, and
    which has been verified by implementing it in a real scale experimental farm for
    technology development. The research farm was located in Southern Finland, in
    Vihti. It included 151 ha of field, all necessary buildings for farm activities,
    four tractors, a combine harvester and all necessary implements to operate the
    farm. The results of Cropinfra based research projects have recently been reported
    in Nikander et al., 2017, Nikander et al., 2015, Pesonen et al., 2014. Download

    The Cropinfra concept and research platform has developed in many research projects
    during 15 years. In this paper we report the methods and means used to develop
    Cropinfra into a framework that can be used as a general agricultural data collection
    and exploitation system for research purposes. The primary objective of this paper
    is to depict how the existing technology on agricultural data collection can be
    integrated into an open research system. A secondary objective is to present the
    experiences and results of different ways to realize the cloud connection of data
    collection system that is at the moment crucial improvement to be included in
    the ISOBUS standard. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
    2, methods, we describe how the information management and software environment
    in a modern farm can be organized, focusing on the parts that are vital to this
    paper. In Section 3 we describe how the CropInfra platform implements farm information
    management infrastructure, and how the system has been used for data capturing
    and management using examples. Section 4 contains the discussion and conclusions
    of our work. 2. Methods This work is based on data collection from agricultural
    machinery, as well as the analysis, and exploitation of that data both in cloud
    systems and in the machinery. In this work, we concentrate on the four phases
    of data collection: measurement, capture, transfer, and storage. In the measurement
    phase, the various sensors take readings and provide values that can be stored.
    In the capturing phase, the sensor values are combined and given semantics by
    assigning each value to a specific variable. In the transfer phase the data created
    in the capturing phase is transferred from the field machine to a cloud service.
    Finally, in the storage phase the data is stored in a cloud service for further
    analysis and exploitation. Data collection from tractors, implements, and other
    agricultural machinery is primarily based on previous development carried out
    for digital systems in heavy machinery and vehicles in general. These systems
    have then been adapted to use in agriculture, and extended in order to best serve
    the specific needs of the agricultural sector. The cloud systems and other software
    used outside the machinery mostly use standard data exchange methods. The data
    formats and analysis methods used are, of course, agriculture-specific in order
    to both capture the nature of the data being used as well as providing useful
    information to act as basis for managing farm, i.e. planning and executing specific
    agricultural operations. 2.1. Farm information management The digital environment
    of a modern farm can already be extremely complex and is becoming increasingly
    so. Fig. 2 shows an example of a farm digital environment, in which the parts
    that are relevant to this study are emphasized. The Figure has been adapted from
    one originally published in Nikander et al. (2015). The elements of the Figure
    that are out of scope for this work are shown in order to provide context for
    the reader how the data transfer in this work would fit into the overall software
    environment of a future farm. In the bottom of the Fig. 2 are depicted the measurement
    and capturing phases of data collection that are carried out in the tractor-implement.
    The transfer phase is represented by the arrow between the tractor-implement and
    the cloud, and the storage phase is in the cloud environment at the top of the
    Figure. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the data transfer infrastructure described above
    is only small part of the overall digital environment of a modern farm. The rest
    of the farm digital environment is described in the original publication in Nikander
    et al. (2015). Download : Download high-res image (343KB) Download : Download

    Nikander et al. (2015). 2.2. Tractor and implement data Currently, data management
    and transfer in tractors and implements are, in practice, based on one of three
    methods. The first is the ISO 11783 (ISOBUS) standard (ISO, 2017a, ISO, 2017b),
    the second are proprietary systems, typically used in older machinery that do
    not conform to ISOBUS, and the third are analog systems, where the data first
    needs to be converted to a digital signal in order to be transferred for permanent
    storage. ISOBUS defines the communication protocol used between different components
    of the tractor-implement system. Data transfer is in specified form, and therefore
    the data created by an ISOBUS system can easily be read and understood by any
    interface conforming to the standard. The majority of machine-related data (such
    as implement status, engine performance, or speed) are covered by the standard.
    There is also a part where manufacturers can add data not currently included in
    ISOBUS. Oksanen et al. (2005) has published an informative article about the standard
    in its use. In addition, ISOBUS defines a set of functionalities and devices required
    from the machinery. The simplest ISOBUS system consists of a tractor ECU (T-ECU),
    an implement ECU (I-ECU) and a universal user interface called universal terminal
    (UT) or virtual terminal (VT) (AEF, 2019b). These devices form the basic structure
    used to control the tractor and implement combination. There can be additional
    devices attached to the system, such as a positioning device (GNSS), or a task
    controller (TC). The task controller can be used to control the implement, as
    well as to store the data logged in an executed field operation (ISO, 2015). A
    TC that is capable of location-specific control and logging is called TC-GEO and
    a TC that is capable only of data logging is called TC-LOG. Not all the machines
    in the agriculture are compatible with the ISOBUS standard. There are also numerous
    proprietary solutions for implement control. There is no single solution for capturing
    data from these systems. Instead, each system needs an interface to adapt the
    data provided by the proprietary system to the farm software infrastructure. Should
    the data be used to control the device, the conversion needs to be done the other
    way around. However, it can be difficult to use farm data as input into a proprietary
    system unless the control software of the system has an open input method. In
    the systems where digital controllers are not used, signals between controls,
    sensors and actuators use only voltage or current signals. In this case, the system
    needs a setup similar to proprietary systems, where the signal is first converted
    to a digital form, and then adapted to the needs of the larger farm infrastructure.
    As analog systems seldom are able to take input except through the analog controllers,
    it can be difficult to use data to control such a system. 2.3. Back-end technologies
    in cloud interfaces Although the ISO 11783 standard will eventually cover the
    data transfer from the tractor to cloud services (AEF, 2019b), these technologies
    have already been used elsewhere. In essence, there are two different technologies
    needed: a data transfer method and a data format. Possible data transfer technologies
    are, for example, REST and MQTT. JSON and Protobuf are potential candidates for
    data format. 2.3.1. REST REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural
    style, not a standard, that describes a set of constrains over the HTTP (Leach,
    1999a) application protocol for designing distributed client/server related information
    systems that provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
    Web services following the REST architectural style are called as RESTful web
    services. The objects provided by the RESTful web services (sometimes referred
    as RESTful API) are called resources. The resources are typically identified by
    using URIs. The role of the application server is to provide access to resources
    and the client accesses, and in some cases it modifies the resources (Fielding,
    2000). A client uses HTTP methods for reading a resource (GET), for creating a
    new resource (POST), to update an existing resource or create a new resource (PUT)
    and for removing a resource (DELETE) (IETF Trust, 2007). 2.3.2. MQTT MQTT (Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a simple and lightweight publish/subscribe-based
    messaging protocol running over TCP/IP, or other similar protocols like Bluetooth
    (ISO/IEC 20922, 2016). MQTT is designed for devices in Machine-to-Machine communication
    and IoT context with limited capabilities and networks with low-bandwidth, high-latency
    and possibly unreliable connectivity. In attempt to assure some degree of delivery
    in constrained environments the standard describes three qualities of service:
    at most once, where occasional message loss is allowed, at least once, where message
    delivery is guaranteed but duplicates can occur and exactly once, where messages
    are assured to arrive and only once. The underlying publish/subscribe messaging
    paradigm means that the system requires a message broker. The broker operates
    between publishers and subscribers taking incoming messages from data provider
    and routing them to relevant destinations. The information (published data) is
    organized in a hierarchy of topics and the broker distributes the information
    to subscribers according to the subscribed topics. Public/subscribe model implements
    decoupling: on the general level publishers and subscribers have no need to know
    anything about each other’s systems (ISO/IEC 20922, 2016). 2.3.3. JSON JSON (JavaScript
    Object Notation) is a programming language independent, open-standard data-interchange
    file format for structuring and sharing data. It is based on subset of the JavaScript
    programming language and it can represent any serializable data. The format can
    be generated and parsed programmatically, and is human-readable at the same time.
    JSON is used as a data exchange format in asynchronous web applications and as
    a natural data exchange format in interfaces that are bound to document oriented
    database management system (Bray, 2015, Bray, 2017). 2.3.4. PROTOBUF Protocol
    buffers offer a programming langue neutral and platform-neutral mechanism for
    serializing structured data as well as an interface description language in the
    inter-machine communication domain (Google, 2018). A data structure in Protobuf
    is defined using three types of variables: required fields, repeated fields, and
    optional fields. Data is compiled into data access classes for automated reading
    and writing for a variety of data streams. For data transfer the Protobuf text
    format messages are encoded into a binary format, which reduces the message size
    up to 40% and speeds up the parsing time up to 50 times when compared to the size
    and processing time of a text based format like XML. Protocol buffers are well
    suited to the environments with time critical computing requirements. (Google,
    2018) 3. Results Fig. 3 depicts the overall structure and the different devices
    and services of the Cropinfra research data collection system on a conceptual
    level. At the bottom of the picture there is the measurement level, which contains
    the physical sensors that are either commercial ones, or reference sensors added
    for research purposes. Sensors are connected to ECUs on the data capturing level
    that transform the analog signals and transmit those to ISOBUS communication (CAN)
    bus. Above the ISOBUS CAN in Fig. 3, there are control and logging devices that
    capture, utilize and store the measurements locally. Finally, at the top of the
    Figure are the data transfer and storage means. The data itself is stored either
    directly in the file system, or in a database. The different phases of the data
    collection process are explained in further detail in the following sections.
    In the following, we will first discuss how legacy machines that provide only
    analog readings need to be modified in order to fit into the Cropinfra framework.
    Then we will discuss data capturing, data transfer in both bulk and real-time
    modes, and data storage. After that, we will discuss the data capturing and transfer
    results using examples where the Cropinfra framework has been successfully used.

    Fig. 3. The structure of the data collection system. 3.1. Measuring legacy machines
    and using reference measurements To support all different implements in Cropinfra,
    analog sensors and I/O device (Axiomatic, 2008) are used to provide measurements
    from non-ISOBUS implements to the CAN-bus. The I/O device sends the machine identifier
    that is the same as the globally unique NAME-identifier used in ISOBUS (ISO, 2019).
    The identification and the measurements messages from I/O device can be read similarly
    as from the ISOBUS machines. In another words, the old and proprietary tractors
    and implements are modified to provide limited ISOBUS-like functionality (see
    Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (311KB) Download : Download full-size

    the side panel of the cabin. For example Valtra 8950 tractor measurements were
    transmitted to ISOBUS using the I/O device which measured the signals from ISO
    11786 signal connector. The ISO 11786 defines a signal connector where the ground
    speed, linkage position and PTO speed are provided using pulses and analog signals.
    The fuel consumption was measured using two FLOWMATE OVAL M-III (Oval, 2016) flowmeters
    (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (122KB) Download : Download full-size

    old tractors. The implements without proprietary ECU were also equipped with Axiomatic
    I/O device. For example the Potila Magnum 540 harrow does not have any electric
    control (see Fig. 6). All the functions are directly hydraulically controlled.
    The I/O device was used to measure whether the implement is in working position
    or not. In other implements the I/O device was also used to provide reference
    measurements to validate correct operation of the commercial controllers. Download

    explained in Section 2.2, the data can be captured from the ISOBUS CAN-bus using
    standard ISOBUS TC-GEO or TC-LOG device. However, if such device is used for research
    purposes, it restricts the use of a parallel device with the same functionality.
    By the TC protocol definition in the standard, the implement can communicate with
    only one TC at a time. These kinds of conflicting situations may occur when technological
    research projects are conducted and ISOBUS prototype devices are tested. Thus,
    a data capturing device that only listen the other ECUs and doesn’t send anything
    to the can-bus was developed. Furthermore, the requirements for data capturing
    in different research projects and in different machines can vary. To meet the
    requirements, the data capturing software had to modify in different research
    project. The National Instruments LabVIEW system engineering software (National
    Instruments, 2018) was selected to be used to program the data capturing software.
    LabVIEW based software are fast to program, flexible and self-documenting. The
    data capturing software was designed to be user friendly and reliable. First,
    the program identifies all the devices in the ISOBUS network using the address
    claim functionality (ISO, 2019). All the devices have to claim their own address
    in the bus using globally unique ISOBUS NAME. The data capturing program is able
    to identify the machines that are connected based on this NAME. Next, the user
    is asked to complete the rest of the information before the data capturing is
    started. The user interface is described more detailed in the next subsection.
    When all the initial information is completed and user has started the data capturing,
    the program stores all essential data from the ISOBUS network. The data capturing
    system does not send any request message to the can bus or use the task controller
    protocol to communicate with the implement. However, the software stores the process
    data messages between the TC and the Implement as well as all other messages that
    are in the bus. 3.2.1. User interface The user interface of the data capturing
    software is shown in Fig. 7 and in Fig. 8. The first picture is from the initial
    data input tab, which is used at the beginning of the work. The second picture
    is from the driving tab, which is used during the work. Download : Download high-res

    interface at the beginning of the work. Download : Download high-res image (388KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Data capturing user interface during
    the work. As described above, the data capturing software automatically detects
    the machines that are connected in the bus. Those are set to be default values
    in the dropdown boxes in Fig. 7 (“Traktori” [tractor in English] and “Työkone”
    [implement]). The user can also manually select the machinery. In addition, the
    user has to select the correct worker (“Suorittaja”), operation (“Työtehtävä”),
    parcel (“Lohko”), plant type (“Viljelykasvi”) and variety (“Siemenlajike”) and
    also the targeted seed (“Siemenmäärä”) and fertilization rate (“Lannoitemäärä”)
    as well as corresponding calibration values (“Kiertokoe”). In the bottom of the
    page, there are also place for free comment (“kommentti”) that will be added in
    the log file. The comment can be added any time during the operation. The user
    interface is slightly different when different types of implements are used. For
    example when capturing data from a ploughing task, there is no need to select
    the plant or rate values and in plant protection tasks there is a selection menu
    for pesticides instead of seeds and fertilizers. Fig. 8 shows the tab used during
    a field operation when data capturing from the sensors has been started. During
    the work, the user interface is used to monitor that all ECUs in the ISOBUS network
    are working and sensors produce the correct data. For example, the GPS-box and
    TC-box are green if those produce data to the bus, otherwise they are red. The
    current field parcel based on the GPS-location is also show in the text box to
    verify that the worker is in a correct parcel. The tractor and implement measurements
    are show as meters for visual verification of correct measurement values. 3.2.2.
    Hardware for data capturing The data capturing software was made using the National
    Instruments LabVIEW system engineering software, so the executable-version of
    the software could be run in any device that has a LabVIEW runtime. In Cropinfra,
    Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 rugged laptop computer was used. The system was used
    in tractors and in a combine harvester. A docking station was mounted in each
    machine to which power supply, CAN adapter and 3G/4G router (ASUS 4G-N12) was
    connected. The basic setup of the hardware is shown in Figs. 9 and 10. The initial
    device setup was selected at the beginning of the Cropinfra-related projects in
    2003. However, additional devices were used in different research projects. Download

    router is used to cloud connection and national instruments CAN-adapter for ISOBUS
    connection. 3.3. Bulk data transfer The Cropinfra data capturing software stores
    all the collected information internally in a csv-type text file. Another option
    would have been to use the ISO 11783-10 XML format. The example of the structure
    of the data file is in the attachments (Table 3). The data file consists of two
    parts: header and data. The header stores the information that describes the agricultural
    operation and is constant during the process (initial data input tab in user interface).
    In the data section, the process data produced by the machinery and sensors are
    stored using 5 Hz logging frequency. The file is created when the user starts
    the data capturing and the data is flushed to the disk in every iteration cycle
    to ensure that there will not be any loss of data even if the system crashes during
    a field operation. The final log file is transferred to the database either manually
    using an USB-stick or automatically using FTP. When using FTP, a file transfer
    daemon monitors the local folder that is used to store the log files. If the daemon
    notices that a new log file is created or data capturing software has been closed,
    it is concluded that previous log file is completed and the transfer of the previous
    log file can be started. The file transfer daemon keeps track of all the log files
    that are created and transferred. If the network is disconnected or the computer
    shutdown, the data transfer is tried again after the computer is started and connection
    resumed. 3.4. Real-time data transfer The Real-time data transfer is integrated
    to the data capturing software. Unlike the bulk data transfer, the real-time data
    transfer attempts to follow the ISO 11783-10/11 standard. The ISO 11783-10 XML
    schema for the data is used in the system (ISO, 2015). The REST (W3C, 2011)/JSON
    (ECMA International, 2017) API (Application Programming Interface) was selected
    to be used, because the JSON is human readable and XML is easy to convert to JSON
    objects. There are at least two different ways to implement the online data transfer
    using REST/JSON communication protocol adapting the ISO 11783-10 standard: 1.
    Using ISO 11783-10 XML structure as it is and converting all the root elements
    to own JSON objects. These objects are requested and sent to and from the cloud
    database, in order to get all the needed ids. New task is started by sending a
    new TSK element (element structure is explained later) with correct references.
    2. Simplify the ISO 11783-10 XML structure by removing the references inside the
    XML and moving all the elements inside the TSK element. All information is sent
    once inside the TSK JSON, which starts the new task. Both approaches have advantages
    and disadvantages, but the first option was chosen because it follows the existing
    standard more closely. 3.4.1. Backend The backend application stack is built on
    REST/JSON API with MongoDB document oriented Data Base Management System (MongoDB,
    2008). The interface is implemented using Java and deployed on GlassFish application
    server, the open source Java EE (Oracle, 2018) reference implementation, and published
    using representational state transfer architectural style that provides a set
    of operations that a remote client can invoke over a network using the HTTP protocol
    (Leach, 1999a). The backend data storage solution is built on MongoDB, a document
    oriented non-relational database management system. MongoDB implements a flexible
    data model that supports storing the JSON data as it is, enabling agile prototyping
    and efficient client-to-backend data processing. 3.4.2. Data operations The prototype
    REST/JSON API provides simple resources for online data transfer from mobile unit
    to data storage and for requesting data from that storage. The API implements
    HTTP Basic Authentication (Leach, 1999b) for authentication and authorization.
    The data transfer sequence starts with authentication handshake between mobile
    unit and back-end (Fig. 11). The client accesses the authenticate resource using
    POST HTTP method and sends BASE64 (Josefsson, 2006) encoded credentials (username
    and password) as Authorization header. Also a valid client id is required. In
    case of successful authentication sequence the authorization is granted by assigning
    an access token to be used in further requests. Download : Download high-res image

    successful authentication and authorization process the client requests a task
    identifier using GET/taskid resource (Fig. 12). The task identifier is used by
    the back-end system as a data set join key to identify the task specific documents
    in the database. The task identifier is required as a path parameter whenever
    the data is posted to the resource. Download : Download high-res image (179KB)

    sent to POST/data/[tasked] resource using the HTTP POST method (see Fig. 13).
    The resource accepts application/json mime type and the payload JSON array can
    contain TSK or TLG type documents, or both. The back-end stores each document
    in received array as an individual object into database (Table 1). Download :

    of the work The work is started by creating a new task, including the header information
    of the work that is meant to be done. The database returns the task id that is
    used as a reference in communication with the database after the beginning of
    the work. Download : Download high-res image (361KB) Download : Download full-size
    image 3.4.4. Definition of captured data It is supposed that each machine has
    a device description according to ISO 11783 standard. The device description defines
    the structure of the TLG elements. In this example two different device descriptions
    are used: one for the tractor and one for the implement. In the attachments, device
    description of the ISOBUS compatible Valtra T-163 tractor and also ISOBUS compatible
    Junkkari Maestro 4000 seed drill are presented. Both produce measurement messages
    to the ISOBUS which can be logged by the data capturing software. The tractor
    T-ECU sends the wheel and ground speed, engine RPM, PTO RPM, Rear hitch position
    and diesel consumption. For the urea consumption, a separate ECU is used to transfer
    the message from the tractor bus to the ISOBUS. The seed drill sends fertilizer
    and seed rates as a response to the TC message. An external I/O device was used
    to send the reference measurements from the fertilizer and seed rates. Position,
    speed, direction and GNSS quality information is received from the GPS. 3.4.5.
    Calibration data The calibration data is send only when the task is started or
    when the calibration is changed. This kind of data is for example seed and fertilizer
    rates when prescription control is not used. Template for the calibration data
    is: Download : Download high-res image (115KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Note! In the standard, there is not G-attribute to specify the device; instead
    it is supposed that device element numbers (DET) are unique. For example, the
    seed rate and fertilizer rate are sent using: Download : Download high-res image
    (150KB) Download : Download full-size image 3.4.6. Process data Process data is
    sent similarly to calibration data. However, there can be multiple TLG-elements
    in the same data frame to allow burst sending of measurements from different time
    stamps. In addition to that, the TLG-element also includes the PTN-element which
    defines the geographical location of the machine when the measurement has taken
    place. Template for the process data: Download : Download high-res image (172KB)
    Download : Download full-size image In this example the process data consist of
    TIME_PC, Seed_r, Fertilizer_r, Position, PTO, Hitch, Diesel, Urea, Tr_rpm, Tr_dir,
    Tr_W_Speed, Tr_R_Speed, LAT, LON, GPS_Speed, Dir, Alt, Qality, Sat_num. Those
    values are originally used in the proprietary data format and mapped to corresponding
    device description elements. The JSON frame is hence: Download : Download high-res

    provides simple resources for requesting data from process data collection. Client
    can request all the TSK documents in collection or alternatively a TSK document
    or a TLG document matching a given task identifier. The resources are: – GET/data/tsk
    – GET/data/tsk/[taskid] – GET/data/tlg/[taskid] If successful, the response mime
    type is application/json and the body is formatted as JSON array with 1 − n JSON
    documents ([ { } ( , … )]). All the POST and GET methods require client id and
    access token fields in HTTP request header (Fig. 14). Download : Download high-res

    Results of data capturing and real-time data transfer In the presented examples
    in Section 3.4.6 Process data, the payload size for the process data (TLG message)
    is 570 bytes if only measurements from one time instance are sent. The measurements
    are updated 5 times per second, which means that the bandwidth requirement is
    2850 bps plus 10% overhead from HTTP-frames producing totally 3.1 kbps bandwidth
    requirement. The upload data rate in 2G EGDE is 60 kbps, in 3G 2 Mbps and in 4G
    LTE 75 Mbps. Even though the upload data rate varies according to the load of
    the network, the required bandwidth is only fraction of the available capacity.
    However, the latency of the mobile network and HTTP server makes it impossible
    to post messages with 5 Hz data rate. The solution was to pack several TLG messages
    together and send those in one http message. In the Cropinfra, the default was
    to pack 5 TLG messages together, and if the network is disconnected, all messages
    after the last successful sent are packed together. The data transfer was tested
    during sowing operations in Luke’s experiment farm in Vihti that is located in
    Southern Finland. There are no big cities near the farm, so the mobile network
    is typical to countryside. The sizes of the transmission buffers (TLG message
    queue length) in different tests are listed in Table 2 together with the field
    area and total number of TLG messages. Table 2. The sizes of the transmission

    TLG messages were sent during the data transfer tests, which means 653 Mbytes
    payload or 18,036,645 individual sensor readings. The total area of the parcels
    were 81.1 ha, which means that the average raw data production density is 8 Mbytes/ha.
    The buffer size was typically less than five TLG messages in queue and in average
    about two, which means that the TLS messages were usually sent successfully once
    per second. However, the network connection was lost occasionally and in every
    parcel the maximum size of the buffer is at least 14. The biggest buffer size
    is in last part of “Pelto A”, when the buffer size was 11,767. The connection
    was lost twice in that test. In the first time, the buffer size grew up to 8125
    before the TLG messages were successfully sent. In the second time, the connection
    did not recover before the computer was shut down. That was the only occasion
    when data was lost during the tests. 4. Discussion and conclusions This paper
    has presented how data collection from field operations can be implemented to
    support research. The system supports both state-of-the-art ISOBUS (ISO 11783)
    compatible tractors and implements as well as old proprietary machinery. The provided
    examples verify that the solution can be used in real scale farm. The data captured
    using the system has been used for example in following research; yield maps and
    in the combined seed drilling applied fertilizer rates were used as source data
    for generating new fertilizer application task (Kaivosoja et al., 2013b, Kaivosoja
    et al., 2017); data from different field operations to determine the spatial overlapping
    of working widths (Kaivosoja and Linkolehto, 2016), where 140 different complete
    field operations were analysed to found out that in driving lines are overlapping
    10% in average; the positioning data was also used to analyse GNSS positioning
    error (Kaivosoja and Linkolehto, 2015). In the work of Kaivosoja et al. (2014),
    application of real time web services were adapted to the platform. In the future
    the collected data is even more valuable when machine learning and other artificial
    intelligence methods will be utilized (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Liakos
    et al., 2018). This paper has also presented how cloud connection can be implemented
    in the data collection system. The solution was designed to be compatible with
    the existing ISO 11783-10 standard. The connection was tested and found to be
    working in the sowing operations of a real scale farm. There was one case of significant
    data loss, which happened when the computer used for data capturing was shut down
    before all data was transferred to the cloud service. The loss could have been
    prevented by saving the buffer to non-volatile memory. It was also found out that
    the payload size does not matter. The latency of the mobile network and the response
    time of the HTTP server as well as the reliability of the connection are the primary
    restrictions in the data transfer. The FMIS working group in AEF is preparing
    the guideline to implement the cloud connection manufacturer independently. After
    the AEF has published the guideline, the work is started in the ISO to standardise
    the solution. Based on the prototypes implemented so far among the AEF community,
    it seems that the solution will be based on the MQTT publish-subscribe-based messaging
    protocol and protobuf data serializing solution developed by the Google. The solutions
    presented in this paper are alternative but still not conflicting solutions. The
    POST message used in this paper could be changed to send messages in MQTT with
    the topic being the same as the URL in POST. The JSON format used in this paper
    is conducted from the ISO 11783 standard and it is possible to convert the JSON
    to the protocol buffer. Appendix A: CSV-file format See Table 3. Table 3. Example
    from the beginning of the datafile. Appendix B: DDOP See Table 4, Table 5. Table

    Citation Excerpt : In fact, the use of CANBUS and ISOBUS technologies can pave
    the way to improving cost allocation to farm output products or activities, creating
    an opportunity for the application of direct costing approaches. These approaches
    can also fit particularly well with site-specific operations in the context of
    precision agriculture, which is characterised by its substantial potential to
    improve agricultural performance (Backman et al., 2019; Pedersen et al., 2019).
    Based on these considerations, this work aims to develop a novel methodology for
    cost calculations of field operations based on real-world CANBUS data and the
    ABC approach to achieve more precise monitoring and allocation of farm costs and
    production costs. Show abstract Smart Farming Technologies Adoption Process: Plan,

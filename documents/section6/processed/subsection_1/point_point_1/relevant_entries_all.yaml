  description: Production processes in horticulture are increasingly industrialized.
    Greenhouses have developed towards high-tech production plants that are highly
    automated by advanced systems for climate control, irrigation, crop monitoring,
    harvesting, internal transportation, sorting and packaging. At the same time,
    horticultural production nowadays is a complex managerial task, which needs advanced
    management information. However, this information is often registered manually
    in enterprise management systems. This paper aims to contribute to a better integration
    of production automation systems and enterprise management systems in the Dutch
    horticulture. It investigates the current situation and existing related standards
    (ISOBUS and ISA-95). Moreover, the paper identifies barriers for the adoption
    of integration solutions, including the economic situation, a decrease of the
    high-end market, a low willingness to cooperate, a relative low scale of growers,
    a high perceived complexity and path dependency, a negative perception of the
    relative advantage and a limited willingness of growers to invest.

  description: 'Like natural ecosystems, the cyber ecosystem comprises a variety of
    diverse participants - private firms, non-profits, governments, individuals, processes,
    and cyber devices (computers, software, and communications technologies) - that
    interact for multiple purposes. Today in cyberspace, intelligent adversaries exploit
    vulnerabilities and create incidents that propagate at machine speeds to steal
    identities, resources, and advantage. The rising volume and virulence of these
    attacks have the potential to degrade our economic capacity and threaten basic
    services that underpin our modern way of life. This discussion paper explores
    the idea of a healthy, resilient - and fundamentally more secure - cyber ecosystem
    of the future, in which cyber participants, including cyber devices, are able
    to work together in near-real time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit
    the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences
    of attacks, and recover to a trusted state. In this future cyber ecosystem, security
    capabilities are built into cyber devices in a way that allows preventive and
    defensive courses of action to be coordinated within and among communities of
    devices. Power is distributed among participants, and near-real time coordination
    is enabled by combining the innate and interoperable capabilities of individual
    devices with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies.
    To illuminate such a cyber ecosystem in action, one might look at today''s practice
    known as “continuous monitoring,” in which system managers use a variety of software
    products to automatically detect and report known security vulnerabilities in
    network nodes. In some cases, system managers further configure their systems
    to automatically remediate detected security deficiencies. To offer an analogy,
    continuous monitoring is to a healthy cyber ecosystem as smoke detectors and sprinkler
    systems are to a “smart” building. At the other end of sophistication in the orderly
    management of a complex system, we draw inspiration from the human body''s immune
    system. To paint a picture that mirrors the body''s ability to defend itself is
    complex. It might include layered defenses and countermeasures that work in tandem;
    specialized roles; powerful methods for rapidly identifying attackers; surge capabilities;
    and the ability to learn and rapidly adapt. A companion analogy may be made to
    the public health system and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    Here, cyber equivalent functions might include threat and incident watch, data
    dissemination, threat analysis, intervention recommendations, and coordination
    of preventive actions. Automation is one of three interdependent building blocks
    of a healthy cyber ecosystem, along with interoperability and authentication.
    Automation can increase speed of action, optimize decision making, and ease adoption
    of new security solutions. A healthy cyber ecosystem might employ an automation
    strategy of fixed, local defenses supported by mobile and global defenses at multiple
    levels. Such a strategy could enable the cyber ecosystem to sustain itself and
    supported missions while fighting through attacks. Further, it could enable the
    ecosystem to continuously strengthen itself against the cyber equivalent of autoimmune
    disorders. Interoperability can broaden and strengthen collaboration, create new
    intelligence, hasten and spread learning, and improve situational awareness. This
    paper posits three types of interoperability - semantic (i.e., shared lexicon
    based on common understanding), technical, and policy - as fundamental to integrating
    disparate cyber participants into a comprehensive cyber defense system. It examines
    how the cybersecurity community has achieved some early successes by explicitly
    separating the management of security information from the management of security
    functions in an approach called security content automation. Such successes include:
    developing naming conventions and shared lists and catalogs of the fundamental
    elements that we identify here as the ecosystem; creating and using machine readable
    languages and formats for expressing security policies or encoding security transactions;
    and developing and using knowledge repositories for best practices, benchmarks,
    profiles, standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules and principles,
    among others. The paper also looks at some challenges associated with expanding
    this approach to ensure a widely distributed, automated, collective defense. Authentication
    can improve trust in ways that enhance privacy and decision making. It is integral
    to many capabilities beyond cyber defense, and the paper looks to the emerging
    National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), detailed below,
    to build a shared foundation. The paper calls for identification and authentication
    technologies that deliver across five operational objectives: security, affordability,
    ease of use and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Additionally,
    the paper calls for consumer guides that rate technologies across all five objectives
    and assist system developers and owners in making phased improvements and selections.
    For automated cyber defense, it calls for strong standards-based device authentication,
    including for software, handheld devices, and small, often wireless, devices composing
    massively scalable grids. The paper also draws on current research on network-enabled
    enterprises that is recasting traditional notions of command and control in the
    direction of focus and convergence. Focus provides the context and defines the
    purposes of an endeavor, but is agnostic regarding who might be in charge or particular
    lines of authority. Convergence refers to the goal-seeking process that guides
    actions and effects, but recognizes that control works in an unconventional manner
    in highly distributed systems. The paper presents a five-level maturity model
    for ecosystem focus and convergence that is associated with increasing agility
    and provides an approach for defining how to achieve and employ these various
    levels. Ecosystem maturity is further explored through a discussion of healthy
    attributes-eight for the ecosystem and eighteen for participants and exchanges.
    The paper concludes with a brief discussion of incentives and recommendations
    for the way ahead. It posits that the slow adoption of available best practices
    and technologies in the face of increasing cyber attacks indicates an imbalance
    of incentives and proposes that better and more widely disseminated aggregated
    and anonymized information about the frequency and actual harm of cyber attacks
    is needed. Despite the many open questions remaining, the field is ripe for planning
    and action.'

    Download chapter PDF 1 Introduction The world’s population is expected to increase
    by one-third until 2050. Majority of those additional two billion people will
    be living in the developing countries. It is expected that more people will be
    living in large population centers and big cities. If the current trends continue
    then the agricultural production will have to increase by 60% to meet the demands
    for food and feed by 2050 (Faurès et al. 2013). Therefore, farming industry has
    become ever more important than before. In this scenario, agricultural transformation
    from conventional to technology based, can play a pivotal role to feed growing
    global population and provide the foundation for economic growth and poverty reduction.
    Challenge is to sustainably increase the food production to provide food as well
    as economic opportunities in both rural and urban communities (Ahmad and Farooq
    2010). The progress in modern agricultural industry transformation can be traced
    back to decade of 1960s. The decadal progress in agriculture sector is provided
    in Table 1. In mid-1960s, the breakthrough in wheat and rice production in Asia
    brought up the famous Green Revolution that symbolized the process of using agricultural
    science to develop modern techniques for the developing world. It started from
    Mexico with the “quiet” wheat revolution and in 1960s and 1970s India, Pakistan
    and the Philippines received world attention for their agricultural progress.
    Over the past four decades in Developing Asia, the irrigated area has more than
    doubled – to 176 million hectares (mha). Fertilizer consumption has increased
    more than 30-fold and tractor in use has increased from 0.2 to 4.6 million that
    can be considered as a positive. What the world would have been like without the
    technological advances that have occurred, had the global grain yields of 1950s
    still prevailed in twenty-first Century we would have needed more than 1.8 billion
    ha additional land to equal the current global harvest (Borlaug 2002). Table 1
    Decade wise agricultural technology innovation and advancement during the past
    60 years Full size table An unprecedented systemic transformation is needed at
    a speed and scale to meet the current and future challenges of food security.
    The future agricultural systems need to be more productive, use inputs efficiently,
    have less variability and greater stability in their outputs. Moreover, the changing
    climate also needs the agricultural systems to be more resilient to, risks, shocks
    and long-term climate variability. The objective of reducing inputs and production
    costs as well as increasing yield and profitability can be addressed by changing
    the farming methods from conventional to conservation. However, more productive
    and more resilient agriculture can be practiced through a major shift in the way
    land, water, soil nutrients and genetic resources are managed for enhanced resource
    use efficiency. This transformation can also improve producers’ access to markets
    and a transformed agricultural system can reduce greenhouse gas emissions per
    unit of production and increase carbon sinks. The real transformation has been
    experienced by the advent of Information technology (I.T). It has brought up a
    revolution; the world is becoming ever more connected through it. The building
    blocks needed to make I.T based Agriculture a reality, has started to come together
    in the past few years. The estimated sale of I.T based agricultural gadgets has
    been increase manifolds as estimated by BI Intelligence (2015) and depicted in
    Fig. 1. We now have the ability to run complex computations at huge scales: a
    100 times increase in computing power. The development of cloud computing resources
    and technologies can allow us to run calculations across hundreds of machines
    and turn that back into one simple actionable solution. A shift in progress of
    technology delivered smart devices those are smaller, faster and cheaper. While
    computing and sensor technologies are in use in the developed world for the last
    two decades, their application in agriculture has not been fully utilized. Smart
    digital services have the potential to help agricultural industry meet its productivity
    and sustainability challenges. Overall, technologies can be utilized effectively
    to solve indigenous agricultural problems of the developing nations. Fig. 1 Agricultural
    IoT devices marketed in various countries. (Estimates based on BI Intelligence,
    2015) Full size image 2 Big Data in Agriculture The world is becoming digitized.
    We now can know more about the land that we farm than ever before. The availability
    of geospatial data archives and real-time data sets from satellites and Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in combination with weather data, digitized soil data,
    and other real-time data streams coming from in-situ smart sensors can give us
    a better understanding of the interaction between crops, weather and soil that
    we would never had before, in ways that are cheaper and faster (Fig. 2). All that
    bulk of data (Big Data) along with computational power is worthless unless we
    can turn it into a simple actionable solution that we can put in the hands of
    the farmer. Fig. 2 Conceptual I.T based agricultural data flow system Full size
    image Over the past years an increasing trend towards data-driven agriculture
    has been identified among farmers. According to an estimate provided by BI Intelligence
    (2016), It is estimated that 0.65 million data points are being generated every
    day from the agricultural farms that will reach up to 0.65 million. It is expected
    that more than 2.3 million data points will be generated by 2030 as many growers
    are pushing big data solutions to obtain qualitative and quantitative data to
    improve decisions regarding agricultural management and to increase their crop
    yields. Data in agriculture can be big in many ways. For example, in case of determining
    spatiotemporal variation of actual crop water use in irrigated areas at regional
    scales, a large number of Landsat scenes will cover the area every 16 days, where
    each Landsat scene occupy a storage space of approximately 1000 MB, and if approximately
    20 images were usable for each year of study and for every scene. It makes a total
    more than 500 images per year (for a typical regional scale study) and more than
    1500 images in a 3-year study. For that case, satellite-imagery (one of the input-information)
    only amounts to more than 15 terabytes, whereas the products generated during
    the course of scientific work (evapotranspiration in this case) are 10 times more
    than the original input data. Similarly, a flight of unmanned aerial vehicle covering
    agriculture area of one village (approx. 60 squares) for multispectral and thermal
    sensing generated 1.25 TB of raw data, that will be multiplied accordingly for
    additional flights during the growing season for pattern recognition, change detection
    and crop yield estimation through image processing and analytics. These projects
    are two examples of the work being carried out in digital and precision/climate-smart
    agriculture that is challenging the state of the art in computation, data storage
    and sharing. The climate-smart agriculture’s reliance on I.T. and digital data
    extends far beyond these examples. Data can also be big because of its lasting
    significance agro-ecological zones, soil survey maps, or the observation of other
    unique events. Also, data can be big because of descriptive challenges that may
    require contextual explanation and metadata. Because digital data can easily be
    shared and replicated and so re-combinable, they present tremendous reuse opportunities,
    accelerating investigations already under way and taking advantage of past investments
    in science. To encourage and enable reuse, data must be well preserved in workable
    formats. In some cases, data loss is economic loss (e.g. experiment have to be
    re-run), or it may also be an opportunity lost forever. Data are assets, and to
    achieve the greatest pay-off from these investments, researchers and institutions
    should document and implement data-management and data-sharing plans that address
    the full life cycle of data. The life cycle management of scientific data presents
    many challenges and opportunities. The challenges are great, but they can be solved
    by focused efforts and collaboration between funders, institutions and scientists.
    To facilitate data reuse, data disciplinary standards should be encouraged that
    will ultimately open the doors for development of disciplinary repositories for
    specific classes of data accessible and manageable through specialized software
    tools. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) genetic sequence database (GenBank),
    the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland database (CropScape), the US
    Geological Survey (USGS) land-cover and water database (GLOVIS) and the US National
    Virtual Observatory (USVO) are good examples of what is possible here. The repository
    of big data help to optimize inputs and increase crop yield thus helping farmers
    to get better agricultural produce. The historic trends of particular crop at
    every field can helpful in better predicting harvesting potentials. The evidence-based
    analysis of this big data can assist agricultural experts to predict and monetize
    crop yields while the farmers can get information regarding their crops and marketing
    places. 3 Data Analytics Management and Forecasting 3.1 Data Analytics The analytics
    of the big data can add value to lives of farmers and sustainability of the farms.
    Farmers cannot make sustainable farming choices based exclusively on large amounts
    of data collected at farm level. In addition to that, they also have limited time
    to digest large amount of data to find trends and/or irregularities. Therefore,
    it is difficult for them to gain actionable insights from all the crop sensors,
    drones and automated tractors. A farm management tool or software with the right
    blend of data and machine learning can help a farmer quickly decide which crops
    (down to the level of the plant) need insecticide, and then apply the chemicals
    spraying in a way that limits environmental impact and increase resource use efficiency.
    Moreover, it can also provide an opportunity to the banks and other monetary institutions
    to better assess the agricultural loans and risks associated with it. For example,
    in Pakistan, a pilot has been successfully tested to analyze the farmer’s ability
    to pay back loans to the banks. The data on land records; crop and soil health
    gathered by the multi spectral cameras on board UAV provided sufficient information
    on farmers’ pay back ability. The analytics of the data helped in improving farmers’
    income and productivity through provision of financial & technical services and
    adoption of good practices. Data analysis will be complex for more challenging
    problems of the agricultural system as well as at the individual farm level. However,
    with more involvement of deep learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture,
    it will gradually become possible to find the exact causes of low productivity
    and making real time decisions to take actions. 3.1.1 Real Time Data Analytics
    An alternative term Operational Intelligence (OI) is also used for Real-Time Data
    Analytics (RDA), a method that tracks the behavior of live systems, integrating
    streaming data with customer needs. RDA is implemented in situations requiring
    insight on a daily, frequent basis and enables farmers to analyze what’s happening
    on the farm and take immediate actions and see the results of their actions. RDA
    complements intelligent decision making by providing insight into new unstructured
    and semi-structured data in real-time. It handles Big Data in ways intelligent
    decision-making cannot. The RDA assisted streaming analytics can help agribusinesses
    make functioning decisions, adapt to the business environment and serve customers
    better when it really matters. RDA refers to a class of analytics that uses real-time
    data processing and data visualization into the processes and events while they
    occur. It is well equipped to address the integral challenges of big data by continuously
    monitoring and running query analysis against a range of high velocity and high
    volume big data sources. It associates and analyzes large volumes of (real time)
    streaming data arriving from diverse sources in order to link related events,
    discover problems, and reveal opportunities intelligently, that need immediate
    attention. 3.1.2 Intelligent Decision Making The intelligent decision making in
    agriculture is based on structured and static data collected from different sources
    to identify long-term trends in historical data of days, weeks, or even months
    long. Data generated by smart sensors collected at farms, on the field or during
    transportation offer a wealth of information about soil, seeds, livestock, crops,
    costs, farm equipment or the use of water and fertilizer. Data analytics in agriculture,
    can help farmers analyze real time data of weather, soil moisture, market trend
    or prices, GPS signals from farm machines and provide insights on how to optimize
    the resources to increase yield. It can further improve farm planning to make
    smarter decisions about the level of resources needed and their distribution strategy
    in order to prevent waste. Daily operations can be made more efficient with improved
    system performance. Additionally, the risk of natural mistakes can be reduced
    as management has a clear picture of what aspects are working successfully and
    those which can be classified as waste. The intelligent decision making has variety
    of uses in agricultural industry in particular as forecasted data, environmental
    impact, competitive advantage and waste reduction. The Agri-business Intelligence
    organizations have deployed many such dedicated analytic platforms including data
    accelerators, data appliances, and cloud based solutions to speed up the performance.
    These technologies may still not deliver true real-time data for informed decision-making,
    but they are enabling the update of data far more frequently and deliver answers
    to queries sooner. Taking everything into consideration, the intelligent decision
    making in smart farming leads to decreased expenditure and increased profits.
    The improved production through precision agriculture along with tailored marketing
    for sales using informed intelligence through smart farming to identify trends
    could lead to an extremely efficient agricultural business. 3.1.3 Tools for Big
    Agricultural Data Analysis As discussed earlier, the real-time data analytics
    depends on advanced technologies. All models used to process big data need to
    be fault-tolerant, scale with data, and have flexibility in the use of resources.
    High performance computing platforms that can provide real-time operation in seconds
    and milliseconds are of critical importance. The events need to be handled as
    they arrive for real-time insights, so high performance should characterize the
    chosen solution. Fresh streaming data can be pooled with archived data to support
    decision-making effectively and accurately. For example, the parallelism of Hadoop
    is excellent in batch processing of collected data but it has high latency. However,
    integration of a streaming data platform for continuous data analytics and streaming
    integration, real-time and interactive processing requirements presents a challenge
    that can be solved with further research in this domain. Data needs to be collected,
    processed, stored, and then finally operated for analytics including machine learning.
    In a typical streaming architecture data is gathered from several smart sensors
    that can be spread across a geographical area in an agricultural system. Then
    a distributed funnel mechanism is needed to put data into a set of available servers.
    Chen and Zhang (2014), reviewed technological solutions for data streams processing
    and open-source real-time processing systems, including Hadoop Online, S4, Storm,
    Flume, Spark streaming, Kafka, Scribe, HStreaming, Impala, and relevant messaging
    technologies. Despite the diversity the real-time systems are very similar. However,
    to come up with an efficient framework for gathering, processing and analyzing
    Big Data in agriculture in a near real-time or even better in a real-time perspective
    further research is required. 3.2 Data Management and Forecasting Every industry
    has their own experiences and challenges when it comes to dealing with big data
    and advanced analytics. Agriculture is no different, but progress is being made.
    An excellent example of using big data analytics to support sustainable farming
    practices is a research conducted by CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture)
    in Colombia with assistance from Colombian government and CGIAR Research Program
    on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. The CIAT research used data
    from FEDEARROZ (National Federation of Rice Growers in Colombia) to learn the
    exact causes of shrunken rice crop yields between 2007 and 2012. By analyzing
    past data and considering climate predictions, they made site-specific recommendations
    for crop variety and exact planting dates that are projected to increase yield
    to numbers that surpassed previous rice harvests. These site-specific interventions
    to reduce inputs and increase yields are referred to the term precision farming
    or interchangeably Precision Agriculture (PA). Real-time assessment of operational
    conditions (e.g. weather or disease alerts) and to carry out agile actions require
    reconfiguration features. These features usually include intelligent assistance
    in implementation, maintenance and use of the technology. For that, a PA grower
    must utilize information gathered from a series of smart devices and systems that
    communicate via the Internet to study and observe crop fields. These smart devices
    may be, temperature and soil moisture sensors, GPS farming apps and modules for
    automated machinery, satellite data, as well as drones used for aerial imaging.
    Where precision agriculture only takes in-field variability into account, the
    smart farming enhances PA by analyzing management tasks not only on location but
    also on data, enhanced by contextual and situational awareness, triggered by real-time
    events (Wolfert et al. 2014). 4 Precision Agriculture Lack of information at right
    time is causing massive losses to the farmers’ income and agricultural sustainability.
    The variability of soil from one field to the other, the variability in weather
    and crops that are planted, means the difference in optimal input for the field
    can vary three to four times from one field to the next, from 1 year to the other.
    So as a farmer, there is no way other than to put together these complex variables
    and come to a solution. Unfortunately, majority of our farmers stick back to the
    practices they know. They fall back to what is familiar or conventional and so
    majority of them barely having enough food to feed their families. Nowadays, farming
    practices are being supported by biotechnology, remote sensing, cloud computing
    and Internet-of-Things (IoT) (Li 2018) or Internet of Everything (IoE) (Dey et
    al. 2015). Internet of Everything refers to the intelligent connection of farmers/people,
    processes, data and things. IoE builds on top of the IoT, enhancing the power
    of the Internet to improve business outcomes. Rapid developments in the IoT and
    Cloud Computing are making smart farming possible. It is helpful in managing farms
    and crops database including farm location and size, cultivated area, inputs,
    time of sowing and harvesting as well as yield. Development of crop information
    management system can help the farmers to make quality and timely decisions. A
    system with a common repository that is able to collect, manage, analyze and disseminate
    the quality decision based on the data streams coming from different sources including,
    satellites, UAVs, in-situ sensors, and ambient weather conditions. Such big repository
    needs to be developed associated with high performance computing powers that can
    handle the flow of big data. Sustainably producing the right quantity and quality
    of food to take on food security challenge can be enabled by technologies. Invent
    of artificial intelligence and I.T have opened new horizons in the field of agriculture.
    Now work is being carried out to make real time agricultural robots and auto steering
    technologies to reduce labor requirements. Advanced precision agriculture technologies
    that deploy machine vision, big data analytics and advanced robotics could allow
    farmers to apply the optimal amount of inputs for each crop and assist with the
    management of livestock and aquaculture, thereby boosting yields and reducing
    water use and greenhouse gas emissions . To produce the highest yield with the
    least impact on the environment and use less water, resources and chemicals, while
    feeding our increasing population is a huge challenge. Now, new innovative technologies
    are taking on that challenge. These modern tools provide farmers with a collection
    of data about the status of the soil, insects, crops, livestock, water, and weather,
    etc. The ability to collect such detailed data has the potential to revolutionize
    agriculture and move farming toward more efficient and sustainable practices.
    The PA concept is well adopted in the various developed countries of the world.
    For example, it started in USA and Europe in early 1980s and early 1990s respectively.
    Figure 3 provides an insight of adoption rate of various technologies in Nebraska,
    USA. The spatial variability of soils was mapped and yield monitors were developed
    to map the spatial yield variability. The researchers further developed precision
    seed drills and variable rate applicators for spot application of seed, fertilizer
    and pesticides. Fig. 3 Precision agriculture technologies adoption in Nebraska,
    USA. (Source: University of Nebraska-Lincoln) Full size image The agricultural
    systems with on-board sensors were developed for automated fertilizer spreading
    and agro-chemical spraying. Use of Unmanned Arial Vehicle for agriculture (AgUAV)
    is also a hot topic of research and these are being used for crop monitoring,
    yield mapping and agrochemical spraying. Japanese are working extensively on sensor
    development, digital and hyper spectral image processing on-board UAVs. Information
    technologies platforms are in use for predictions of optimized local farming practices
    for the farmers. They provide information to the participant farmers on crop and
    soil health, weather conditions, socio-economic characteristics, labor and inputs
    availability and other related variables (Cheema et al. 2018). The flow of information
    is well described by Gebbers and Adamchuk (2010) and summarized in Fig. 4. Fig.
    4 Precision agriculture information flow for a cropping season. (Source: Gebbers
    and Adamchuk (2010)) Full size image Information technology can be used in providing
    a precision agriculture package by developing e-farm production system based on
    Precision Agriculture techniques, Crop and livestock management (RFIDs), precision
    irrigation applications, Crop water and pest/disease management, Wireless moisture
    sensing networks, Wireless communication in UAVs used for vegetation health detection,
    Rainfall monitoring system based on mobile communication data, Cloud services
    for knowledgebase on soils, nutrients, yields by making soil, nutrient and yield
    maps and disseminating through mobile networks and variable rate application based
    on GPS and GIS systems. 5 Communication and Information Sharing The innovations
    in Information Communication Technology (ICT) brought changes in many sectors
    yet agriculture and food systems have been slow to benefit from these innovations.
    There exists a great potential to harness the power of digital and I.T. It can
    promote timely as well as evidence-based decisions to improve the entire agriculture
    sector of the developing nations. Awareness and capacity building, better planning
    and community involvement is needed for agricultural breakthroughs. Since ICT
    particularly the IoT and related big data analytics provide electronic monitoring
    of crops, as well as related environmental, soil, fertilization, and irrigation
    conditions. Such a monitoring data can be used to identify which crop varieties
    will meet the challenge enhanced productivity at the particular farm anywhere
    in world. The plant phenomics (an area of biology concerned with the measurement
    of phenomes—the physical and biochemical traits of organisms—as they change in
    response to genetic mutation and environmental influences) is used to characterize
    the crop varieties. Therefore, association of monitoring and related data analysis
    results with specific crop varieties (i.e., plant genes and phenotypes) will revolutionize
    the way food is produced globally. Majority of the smart farming solutions are
    currently point based and limited to the use of specific IoT devices (e.g., a
    specific soil moisture sensor), with no further support for data analysis or sharing.
    To obtain a meaningful solution by using these IoT devices, a significant effort
    is required to integrate and correlate the data obtained from different IoT devices,
    e.g., data sets acquired from, a fertilizer sprayer (made by one manufacturer),
    soil moisture sensors (made by a different manufacturer). Development of such
    integrated model that permits a) effortless integration and use of any IoT sensor
    or device b) supports the scalable data analytics and c) allows plant biologists
    and farmers/growers to analyze and visualize plant performance data, will take
    us a step closer towards the ultimate goal (Jayaraman et al. 2016). Because use
    of internet and smartphones is enhancing rapidly. The data sharing apps with linkages
    to integrated platforms and models are future of farming and agricultural marketing.
    According to the 2015 report of International Telecommunications Union, 3.2 billion
    people were using the Internet across the globe of which 2 billion were from developing
    countries and similarly 92 of every 100 inhabitants in these countries have mobile
    phone subscriptions (ITU 2015). Therefore, the integration of I.T and agriculture
    can provide an opportunity to the farmers to attain maximum benefits by increasing
    yield, improving production, managing harvest and marketing the produce. However,
    more research is required to make customized solution and platforms to provide
    solutions tailored to specific farming scenarios in developing countries. The
    customized platforms for data sharing, manipulation and decision support are the
    key here. Where farmers can remotely monitor their equipment, crops livestock,
    stats about feeding and produce as well as market trends and information. That
    technology can even assist them to run prediction analysis for the crops, livestock
    and market. One of the biggest names in farming equipment John Deere is using
    integrated platform to connect its self-driving farm vehicles to the internet
    and display data of crop yields (BI 2015). All of these techniques are making
    data driven farming a reality. More and more data sources either in-situ, on-farm,
    low altitude or satellites can provide useful information to improve production,
    minimize inputs and environmental services from agriculture. 6 Conclusion The
    world is on the crossover of a technological revolution in the agriculture industry.
    The future of farming is in collecting and analyzing big data. Advanced analytics
    and precision agriculture will be the key to harness the technology and convert
    knowledge to farming practices in order to maximize efficiency. IoT based technologies
    with the involvement of modern instruments (sensors, computers, UAVs and satellites)
    have the potential to systematically change the traditional system of farming
    towards a low input, high efficiency and sustainable farming. These technologies
    will inevitably prove essential for taking on, what would likely be an insurmountable
    challenge, sustainably increasing our food supplies. The application of information
    technologies in agriculture wills not only help farmers to improve economy but
    also help the country to regulate overall economy and trade. Current wave of mobile
    technology proliferation in rural areas could provide opportunity to the farmers
    to improve agricultural productivity based on decisions made backed by better
    information based on big data analytics. With just a click on a smartphone, farmers
    can remove the guessing from their daily work and make the best choices that benefit
    their business and the sustainability of the land. References Ahmad M, Farooq

  key_findings: 1) Water scarcity patterns across China changed over the decade studied,
    in part due to climate change and rapid agricultural sector changes. 2) Water
    scarcity should be viewed dynamically and policies and institutional arrangements
    should be considered to reduce water consumption.
  limitations: This paper is not about automated irrigation systems or the need for
    interoperability and standardization, which is the main topic of the paper. It
    is a study done on the effects of irrigation systems on water consumption, storage
    and water scarcity patterns in 193 regions of China from 2002-2012.
  main_objective: To determine the impact that irrigation systems have on water scarcity
    patterns in 193 regions of China from 2002-2012
  relevance_evaluation: The paper's analysis of how water scarcity patterns are influenced
    by irrigation systems is moderately relevant to the point of discussion, which
    is the need for interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation systems.
    However, it does not directly address the specific issue of data integration and
    seamless communication.

  description: 'It is needed to solve the problems such as relatively low input-output
    ratio and environmental pollution for Chinese agriculture, with the large amount
    of agricultural production and consumption. In the background of changing international
    situation and frequent natural disasters, transforming traditional agricultural
    production methods in China is an urgent. Driven by emerging technologies such
    as artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud platform, automatic control,
    and new generation communication and so on, precision agriculture came out and
    was undoubtedly an effective way. Precision agriculture has become a common choice
    for developing sustainable and high-yield agriculture around the world. In order
    to obtain the development orientation of precision agriculture and successful
    practices in the world, this paper reviews the studies on precision agriculture
    developing status. The aim of this paper is to refine the experiences of precision
    agriculture developing in the main developed countries and regions and take a
    look at the precision agriculture development in China. Adopting the method of
    systematic literature analyzing and summary, Section 1 studies the development
    status of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions, such
    as America, Japan, European Union and Israel. The idea of precision agriculture
    was first proposed in America. Until today, America has developed mature precision
    agriculture system, which benefits from the highly developed technologies. Considering
    the serious contradiction between large population and less farmland, during 1970s,
    Japan took measures of consolidating farmland on a large scale and building farmland
    infrastructure and so on to improve the agricultural production conditions. The
    agricultural community was also formed to operate collaboratively the agricultural
    production. The development of precision agriculture in European Union is driving
    by digital technologies. The water-saving agriculture represented by drip-irrigation
    and sprinkler-irrigation has made remarkable results in Israel. The development
    experiences of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions
    enlighten us that: 1) the leading by government is the key; 2) the informatization
    construction is the foundation; 3) the advanced technology is the core; 4) the
    cultivation of new type of farmers is the guarantee. Section 2 analyzed the basements
    and weaknesses for developing precision agriculture in China. The weaknesses are
    the emphasis in this section. First, the farmland in China is scattered and the
    infrastructure is not perfect. Taking the informatization perspective, even though
    number of agriculture related information systems exist, the data and information
    are not interoperable between these systems. Second, at the present stage, we
    cannot acquire the temporal and spatial continuous agricultural information due
    to the rarity domestic satellite data and ground sensors for agriculture monitoring.
    Third, automatic variable operating system and equipment are lacking since the
    technology integration of information technology, communication and agricultural
    machine has not been achieved. Fourth, insufficient high-quality agricultural
    talents. Facing these weakness and Chinese conditions, Section 3 provided five
    suggestions to develop precision agriculture in China. Firstly, our government
    should overall plan and give guarantee in police making, infrastructure construction
    and financial support, etc. Secondly, we should improve the agricultural production
    condition through expanding moderately the operating scale of farmland and constructing
    the field infrastructure net and the national agricultural information platform.
    Thirdly, the key technology research, such as the information retrieval using
    remote sensing and technology integration of communication, automatic controlling,
    spatial information and smart machinery must be focused. Fourthly, the new type
    of personnel in agricultural field can be cultivated. Fifthly, pilot demonstration
    can be carried out according to the regional difference.'

    solve the problems such as relatively low input-output ratio and environmental
    pollution for Chinese agriculture, with the large amount of agricultural production
    and consumption. In the background of changing international situation and frequent
    natural disasters, transforming traditional agricultural production methods in
    China is an urgent. Driven by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence,
    internet of things, cloud platform, automatic control, and new generation communication
    and so on, precision agriculture came out and was undoubtedly an effective way.
    Precision agriculture has become a common choice for developing sustainable and
    high-yield agriculture around the world. In order to obtain the development orientation
    of precision agriculture and successful practices in the world, this paper reviews
    the studies on precision agriculture developing status. The aim of this paper
    is to refine the experiences of precision agriculture developing in the main developed
    countries and regions and take a look at the precision agriculture development
    in China. Adopting the method of systematic literature analyzing and summary,
    Section 1 studies the development status of precision agriculture in the main
    developed countries and regions, such as America, Japan, European Union and Israel.
    The idea of precision agriculture was first proposed in America. Until today,
    America has developed mature precision agriculture system, which benefits from
    the highly developed technologies. Considering the serious contradiction between
    large population and less farmland, during 1970s, Japan took measures of consolidating
    farmland on a large scale and building farmland infrastructure and so on to improve
    the agricultural production conditions. The agricultural community was also formed
    to operate collaboratively the agricultural production. The development of precision
    agriculture in European Union is driving by digital technologies. The water-saving
    agriculture represented by drip-irrigation and sprinkler-irrigation has made remarkable
    results in Israel. The development experiences of precision agriculture in the
    main developed countries and regions enlighten us that: 1) the leading by government
    is the key; 2) the informatization construction is the foundation; 3) the advanced
    technology is the core; 4) the cultivation of new type of farmers is the guarantee.
    Section 2 analyzed the basements and weaknesses for developing precision agriculture
    in China. The weaknesses are the emphasis in this section. First, the farmland
    in China is scattered and the infrastructure is not perfect. Taking the informatization
    perspective, even though number of agriculture related information systems exist,
    the data and information are not interoperable between these systems. Second,
    at the present stage, we cannot acquire the temporal and spatial continuous agricultural
    information due to the rarity domestic satellite data and ground sensors for agriculture
    monitoring. Third, automatic variable operating system and equipment are lacking
    since the technology integration of information technology, communication and
    agricultural machine has not been achieved. Fourth, insufficient high-quality
    agricultural talents. Facing these weakness and Chinese conditions, Section 3
    provided five suggestions to develop precision agriculture in China. Firstly,
    our government should overall plan and give guarantee in police making, infrastructure
    construction and financial support, etc. Secondly, we should improve the agricultural
    production condition through expanding moderately the operating scale of farmland
    and constructing the field infrastructure net and the national agricultural information
    platform. Thirdly, the key technology research, such as the information retrieval
    using remote sensing and technology integration of communication, automatic controlling,
    spatial information and smart machinery must be focused. Fourthly, the new type
    of personnel in agricultural field can be cultivated. Fifthly, pilot demonstration
    can be carried out according to the regional difference.   Keywords: precision

    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    and transportation applications Jyothi and Vardhan (2016) 2015 IoT was used for
    locating people and objects Sharma and Lohan (2019) 2020 IoT was used for monitoring
    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages
    (Modified from Acharya et al., 2021). Sensors Advantages Disadvantages Red/green/blue
    (RGB) Portable, common, relatively inexpensive, provide high-quality RGB images
    for ortho-imagery and digital surface model, easy to integrate with different
    platforms Wider bandwidth and lower spectral resolution lack geometric and radiometric
    calibration Multispectral Multiple wavelengths allow geometric reconstruction
    and radiometric calibration Relatively costly, image processing relatively complex
    compared to RGB, radiometric, and atmospheric corrections may be required, limited
    compatibility to UAVs Hyperspectral High spectral resolution data across various
    wavelengths of the visible and near infrared spectrum Higher cost than multispectral,
    low signal-to-noise ratio, limited compatibility with standard UAVs and flight
    control software packages, radiometric and atmospheric corrections may be required
    Microwave High spatial resolution, useful under low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover) Sensitive to surface roughness Thermal Sense a wide range
    of temperatures, relatively cheaper Thermally sensitive, vignetting effects, low
    spatial resolution, radiometric corrections required, sensitive to change in surface
    roughness LiDAR Generates dense cloud points, high-quality data, direct geometric
    measurements Higher cost, limited compatibility with UAVs, requires ground filtering
    corrections TABLE 3. Selected vegetative indices and their application in agriculture

    near-infrared; R, red. There are several types of UAV systems used for agricultural
    applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing
    and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like
    wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower
    cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs.
    Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical
    takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs
    may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using
    near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be
    sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete,
    2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on
    up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous
    chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate
    application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake
    in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs
    and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software
    have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs
    to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies
    (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite
    (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making
    informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications
    of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the agricultural domain (adapted and modified
    from Puri et al., 2017). Agricultural UAVs Usage Honeycomb AgDrone system, Wilsonville,

    cloud-based advanced mapping software and Agribotix imaging for high-resolution
    aerial imaging and field and crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems The main purpose of cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems is to provide tools to software developers to develop
    a variety of cloud-based services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict
    crop yield (Kaloxylos et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection,
    statistical analysis, and the creation of commands to control farming equipment.
    In a practical setup, data is generally transferred from a local farm management
    system to the cloud repository associated with the monitoring service in order
    to keep track of the farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an
    expert online system such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly
    available to the farmers. An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al.,
    2012). The first is an information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based
    climatic and agricultural dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air
    temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations;
    names, models, and prices of agricultural products; operating status of agricultural
    equipment, and locations of agricultural products. The second layer is the transport
    or network layer, which is responsible for transmitting and processing data received
    from the sensor layer above. Finally, the application layer analyzes and processes
    information to cultivate digital awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based
    ICT system is GeoFarmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular
    design, which is interoperable through an application programming interface. It
    follows open access standards regarding existing tools and technologies and the
    system is designed and developed in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire
    process and lessons learned in the development process are documented. Similar
    software architecture has been defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for
    a smart digital future, which focuses on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable
    firmware and a set of interfaces already embedded in the General Packet Radio
    Service board. Cloud-based systems have been applied to monitor pesticide use
    and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018). Interfaces of such systems
    consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and application, optimal harvest
    time estimation, and a feedback system formulation to monitor the health of vegetables.
    A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented through AgroMobile (Prasad et
    al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices with the help of image
    processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based data processing. A
    similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing has been proposed
    in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for aggregate farming
    in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency and productivity
    and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control in greenhouse
    production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature in
    agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets that
    are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and applications.
    The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices has the potential
    to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest analysis,
    and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in different
    topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019) and
    are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision
    support systems in Internet of Things (IoT)-based agricultural applications. Application
    of IoT in irrigation decision support, input, and salient features Reference Input
    variables: Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, dew point, vapor

    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

  explanation: The paper primarily focuses on the application of machine learning
    and an interactive, cloud-based platform for improving water resource management
    and precision irrigation. The authors developed an 'Intelligent Environmental
    Knowledgebase' (i-ekbase) system that integrates various data sources, including
    satellite imagery, weather data, and user inputs, to create predictive models
    for soil moisture and other environmental variables. The importance of interoperability
    and standardization in integrating heterogeneous data sources for seamless communication
    and compatibility is highlighted in the context of implementing an end-to-end
    automated irrigation system.

    IEEE Conference Location: Vancouver, BC, Canada SECTION I. Motivation Australia
    has an uneven distribution of water resources across the continent. There is a
    relative abundance in the north where few people resides whereas in the densely
    populated southern regions water scarcity has been a long-lasting issue for the
    past decades, especially in the agricultural sector where irrigation is the lifeline
    of the industry. This paper proposes and investigates a novel approach of using
    data-driven machine learning based interactive architecture to overcome the drawbacks
    of conventional water balance modelling approaches due to the fact that the spatial
    and temporal resolution are limited as well as relying highly on condition-specified
    field experiments as a control group. Machine learning based approaches always
    require ground truthing to achieve a desirable predictive model and prediction
    accuracy, bringing significant limitations in industry scale adaptation. It requires
    continuous human intervention and interaction. Convention of Industry 4.0 Workgroups,
    namely, WG2, WG3, and WG4, tell us the principal expectation and motivation behind
    an adaptation of Industry 4.0 in The Real Environment, The Economic Environment
    and Human Beings and Work; whereas cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things,
    cloud computing, predictive analytics and cognitive computing are at core. We
    aim to expand the adaptation of Industry 4.0 standards from the world of manufacturing
    to a broad range of complex predictive decision making problems, by introducing
    an architecture that allows users to interact directly with ground truthing of
    predictive models to improve accuracy in a standardized manner [1]–[4]. SECTION
    II. Interactive Platform: I-EKbase Intelligent Environmental Knowledgebase (i-ekbase)
    is an autonomous Big Data Analytics Engine running a CLOUD system. i-ekbase is
    an easy to use fully automated geographic information system (GIS), primarily
    focussing on precision agricultural and biodiversity monitoring applications,
    automatically integrating data from various satellites with local weather data,
    farmers'' knowledge and applying Machine Learning techniques to create a Data
    Driven Future for global Agriculture. i-ekbase is regularising satellite remote
    sensing for all purpose precision agricultural monitoring on a mobile device,
    for greater benefit to global Agri-community and to increase Agri-business profitability.
    i-ekbase services provide weekly/daily large area wise resource management map
    products, including normalised vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture, biomass,
    surface temperature, vegetation landscape maps for supporting remote digital scouting,
    large area wise farm monitoring and decision support system and rapid intervention
    of a management issue. Fig. 1. Snapshot of the i-EKbase visual interactive system
    based on big data integration over large farming areas. Show All Fig. 2. Snapshot
    of the i-EKbase visual mobile application based interactive system based on industry
    4.0 concepts. Show All Initially heterogeneous data sources, namely, Bureau of
    Meteorology-Long Paddock (SILO), Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP),
    Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS), Australian Cosmic Ray Soil
    Moisture Sensor Network (CosmOz), and Australian Digital Elevation (DED) databases
    were integrated along with NASA''s LANDSAT and European Space Agency''s Sentinel-satellite
    based data, to develop the regularized visual systems (base map products are being
    delivered to Cloud based Web and Mobile applications simultaneously) to start
    with the proposed interaction with the end users to create a truly Industry 4.0
    environment [3]. SECTION III. Interactive Ground Truthing We report the possibility
    of producing most probable high resolution estimation regarding the water balance
    in any region within Australia by implementation of an intelligent system that
    can integrate spatial-temporal data from various independent sensors and models,
    with the ground truth data produced by 250 practitioners from the irrigation industry
    across Australia. During the experimental period, participating farmers used i-ekbase
    mobile app to interact with their farm maps, took real measurement of biomass,
    NDVI, soil moisture and surface temperature, before drawing polygons on touch
    screen and entering values to create ground truth profiles on the cloud system.
    These profiles were used as primary integrated observed knowledge about the farm
    to create the probabilistic hot-spot map. Each pixel on the Google earth represents
    15m-resolution analytical outcome from the big data integration. Soil moisture,
    soil surface temperature, water consumption and NDVI values of each pixel were
    used to train a simple data driven model to train a supervised knowledge predictor.
    The refined threshold of these variables was modeled based on the ground truth
    collected and also by close consultation with farm manager. This predictive system
    was trained based on farm''s historical records and hyperspectral ground truth
    data as training targets. Fig. 3. User defined ground truthing via interactive
    architecture (called fieldnote), transfering the power of data to the users. Show
    All Ground Truth data profile created by the users were then stored and displayed
    instantaneously on all i-ekbase system for future reference, machine learning
    model adaptation and improvement of overall accuracy of the resource management
    maps. There was no other way to interact such a large number of real time users
    and adapt ground truth data, than through a cloud based efficient interactive
    architecture [4]. Fig. 4. System design was focused and justified as an industry
    4.0 adaptation, as this system continuously adapting the four pillars of industry
    4.0, interoperability, information transparency, technical assistance. Show All
    Fig. 5. Illustrates the recommended application flow, which can be simplified
    as a two stage process: Stage 1, Google maps overview of all available stations
    in australia as an overlay layer representation; stage 2, traffic light style
    indication of irrigation water balance status of the user-specified station. On
    the mobile app, the user is able to locate the point of interest on the google
    map and correct the status of environmental resource with actual physical sensor
    based reading and local knowledge, hence updating the predictive classification
    paradigm dynamically and interactively. Show All SECTION IV. Unsupervised Knowledge
    Representation Clustering algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
    Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) were used to process integrated data. The objective of this
    analysis was to establish a list of least correlated attributes which were contributing
    towards the most data variance. In the PCA method each orthogonal (principal)
    vector accounts for a certain amount of variance in the data, with a decreasing
    degree of importance. FCM clustering provided partitioning results with additional
    information sup-plied by the cluster membership values indicating the degrees
    of belongingness, where ‘C’ was the total number of clusters. FCM was applied
    on the selected least correlated attributes from PCA to estimate the natural grouping
    of the data. Fig. 6. Representation of the knowledge recommendation layer. PCA-FCM-SOM
    based knowledge recommendations stored as RDF along with the existing RDF based
    i-EKbase. Show All World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) introduced a format called
    Resource description framework (RDF) which is now a standard model for machine
    readable data presentation. It decomposes data into the pieces (subject, object
    and predicate) and gives a uniform resource identifier (URI) for each resource
    or object. Through the URIs, it is possible to read the information about the
    particular resource on the web by using the HTTP access. The RDF has features
    that facilitate data integration even if the underlying schema differs, and it
    specially supports the evaluation of schemas over time without requiring the entire
    data consumer to be changed. This dynamic data analysis provided ranked attributes
    (according to their importance) which were effectively a valuable recommendation
    (Fig. 6) about the whole integrated data set for any future application design.
    PCA–FCM Clustering outputs and final membership function outputs were used to
    design and initialize the SOM. The SOM algorithm was developed by Kohonen to transform
    an incoming signal pattern of arbitrary dimension into a one or two-dimensional
    discrete map. Analyses carried out using Kohonen''s Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN) fall into the category of “unsupervised learning”, in which the relevant
    multivariate algorithms seek “clusters” in the data. PCA and FCM analysis were
    used to guide the SOM clustering in terms of initializing the weights. A SOM of
    [36 × 1] network size was created to capture the natural grouping [5]–[10]. SECTION
    V. Predictive Analytics Experiments An comparison study of various supervised
    machine learning methods (including Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression,
    Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Adaptive neuro-Fuzzy
    Inference System (ANFIS), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Radial basis Function
    network (RBFN)), that exploits the class labels of the samples to identify feature
    projections that potentially maximize class discrimination, was conducted to showcase
    some parametric evaluation of the i-EKbase system (Table 1). Supervised learning
    algorithms were trained and tested against the ground truth provided by the participating
    users, showcasing the possibility of Industry 4.0 Adaptation of Machine Learning.
    Table I. Predictive learners performance A conventional 10-fold cross-validation
    was performed using the 50% randomized holdout to have a better estimation of
    the classifier performance. Best result shows that from this particular data set
    up to 90% prediction accuracy is achievable with 85% specificity and 79% sensitivity.
    This was a combination of unsupervised feature selection and supervised classification
    to test the generalisation capability of the selected features from the actual
    environmental data set increasing dynamically every day on the cloud system [1]–[10].
    SECTION VI. Adaptation in Industry 4.0 Pivot Irrigation Sustainable pivot irrigation
    based cropping and water resource management in a catchment with very limited
    water, are heavily dependent on catchments water balance model. I-EKbase was applied
    for an expert agricultural decision support system related to the catchment water
    balance model. The purpose of applying SOM on the database was to provide visual
    recommendations about the soil moisture variability on paddock, by combining user
    provided ground truth data with environmental data, applying machine learning
    techniques for predictive solution on a large area with full interoperability
    and information transparency. In this was power, control and quality of the modelling
    and associated services were passed on to the end user in a very much decentralized
    manner, respecting the four pillars of Industry 4.0 [5]–[14]. Fig 7(a). A typical
    example of pivot irrigation with robotic water spraying pivot. Show All Fig. 7(b).
    Depicts a SOM layer showing neurons as gray-blue patches and their direct neighbor
    relations with red lines. The neighbor patches are colored from black to yellow
    to show how close each neuron''s weight vector is to its neighbors, while various
    machine learning techniques were applied on the industry 4.0 compliant i-EKbase
    platform. Show All Fig. 7(c). Final outcome of a preditive irrigation map of the
    pivot based on provided point based ground truth. This spatial variation provides
    optimized assistance to guide and control the water spraying to imporve efficiency
    of water management. Show All SECTION VII. Future Adaptation in Material Industry
    In future we aim to expand theme of Industry 4.0 adaptation of machine learning
    and the newly developed architectural framework in our other projects and completely
    different industries, especially in modern manufacturing and material optimization
    for soft-robotics. Newly discovered and experimented Shape memory polymers (SMPs)
    are increasingly being used for application solutions in automotive, aerospace,
    construction and commercial field. But being a nascent field there is little knowledge
    on the shape recovery behaviour of laminates with a SMP film and there are only
    methods reported in literature for quantifying the material behaviour. Through
    various experimental data gathering and analysis, influences of different variables
    that affect the recovery behaviour of thermoplastic shape memory polyurethanes
    based laminates including ambient temperature (45 °C and 65 °C), material modulus,
    and adhesive strength have been investigated to develop a physical model to formulate
    the recovery behaviour of the material. It has been identified that a fundamental
    optimization problem that needs to be solved is to maximize the final angle recovery
    ratios and recovery rates of a material to increase the overall efficiency of
    a targeted SMP material [15]–[18]. In this future study we aim to develop a state-of-the-art
    test rig facility to conduct various experiments on a targeted SMP and capture
    useful behavioural changes by collecting contributing variables. On the other
    hand we will employ digital imaging technology to capture visual recovery related
    footprint of the material''s recovery phenomenon as a ground truth of the desired
    behavioural aspect with full interoperability and information transparency to
    make it compliant with Industry 4.0 standards. In the modelling phase, various
    machine learning techniques will be tried and tested based on the experimental
    datasets to develop an optimized and predictive data driven model to emulate the
    SMP recovery behaviour. The novel model could be adapted for various SMPs and
    accurate predictability could help to discover a new class of decorative films
    capable of improved formability and shape recovery in polymer laminates. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    GA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Farming is one the earliest activities undertaken
    by humans to build civilizations. Feeding the ever-increasing world population
    is a huge challenge and the role farming in meeting this challenge cannot be overstated.
    The recent recognition of the World Food Program (WFP)1 as the Nobel Peace Prize
    recipient underlines the importance food security plays in our lives. Consequently,
    it is equally important to ensure that sustainable farming practices are followed
    so that land is not overused and exploited. Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    can serve as a critical asset to enhance agricultural practices and enable efficient
    and sustainable farming. With the application of IoT and Machine Learning (ML)
    algorithms in the farming sector, a new domain of smart agriculture has emerged.
    Using IoT to monitor and measure different aspects of soil, land and crops can
    lead to development of better and more sophisticated farms that use data-driven
    models and applications to enhance their production, which is also known as smart
    farming and/or precision agriculture today. With the rapid diffusion of smart
    devices and IoT technology in the agriculture domain, farms have grown more advanced,
    technically competent and production efficient [1]. The use of IoT has been abundant
    and in turn led to the creation of a technology based smart ecosystem. Such a
    connected system enabled by smart devices and key technologies as cloud and edge
    computing leads to the creation of smart farms which generates large amounts of
    data. This large amount of data can be analyzed using ML and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) technologies to extract crucial insights and implications. The need for such
    smart farms has been stressed in research and is equally important for the sustenance
    of smart cities [2], [3]. As smart cities develop so should the infrastructure
    around farming, as it is not only an extension but a necessary derivative of the
    fully connected IoT architecture. However, the increase in number of smart connected
    farms has not been without issues. There is a possibility of adversaries sabotaging
    farms, malicious agents compromising the functioning of such farms or even cyber-attacks
    against smart farming adopters [4], [5]. It is therefore important to have strong
    security in place that thwarts such attacks and better data management practices
    so that informed decisions can be made that do not jeopardize smart farm outputs.
    Another reason to ensure data security and management is to increase the farm
    owners’ confidence in the ability of technology to actually provide them with
    visible benefits. The benefits accruing from data analysis of smart farms can
    either be related to greater production output, or better land use, or even the
    discovery of efficient seed application techniques. The use of cloud computing
    as well as web-based services has ushered in a new era where smart farms plan
    better yield management, adopt responsible farming practices, and indulge in sustainable
    techniques. It is for this reason that IT has been so readily deployed and used
    in the agriculture sector, giving rise to the smart farms concept [6]. Smart farming
    involves the adoption of IoT devices to automate processes on regular farms, such
    as irrigation and seed application. It also involves collecting data on the soil
    quality, moisture and crop yield metrics. Such data can drive new knowledge discovery
    which benefits and informs the entire agricultural industry of new and efficient
    ways to farm and grow crops. Also, as new developments take place in the IoT industry
    and advances are made in data usage techniques, it is equally important that these
    improvements rapidly percolate to the agriculture domain primarily to the associated
    smart farms. The increasing number of smart farms demands cooperation between
    each other which allows these farms to learn efficient farming techniques by applying
    data-driven models to smart farm data and share resources among each other. This
    type of cooperation between several smart farms is known as Cooperative Smart
    Farming (CSF). While CSF is an attractive framework to benefit multiple farms
    together, it is important to understand that there are also security and privacy
    issues that could arise in this framework. Data privacy could be a major concern
    for some smart farms, thus, it is essential to address security and privacy in
    CSFs. There may be different types of farms participating in a CSF. A farm, which
    has low-quality agriculture data generated from IoT devices, always wants to be
    a part of CSF to take benefit from other farms. A farm, which has huge number
    of resources and high-quality agriculture data, does not receive any benefit in
    CSF. Therefore, there is an issue for smart farms to become a member of CSF and
    contribute effectively as member of the CSF. In this paper, we address the research
    problem of unfair collaboration among smart farms in a CSF by proposing a CSF
    game model, and a novel fair strategy which enforces each smart farm to cooperate
    in CSF based on the clusters formed to achieve benefit through AI assisted application.
    The main contributions of this paper are as follows. We identify the issue of
    unfair collaboration among farms in cooperative smart farming. For instance, some
    smart farms which generate low-quality data to build machine learning model can
    take advantage from other farms which have high-quality data. We present two different
    use case scenarios including different types of smart farms in a CSF along with
    rationality assumption. We propose a fair strategy to enforce farms to cooperate
    in CSF to build ML model. We present a proposed implementation framework that
    can be employed and extended to enable CSF use case scenarios utilizing a real-world
    cloud-enabled IoT platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The rest of paper is organized
    as follows. Section II presents relevant work on CSF, security and privacy issues
    in CSF, and game theoretic models used in smart farming. Cooperative smart farming
    use case scenarios along with rational assumption are discussed in Section III.
    Section IV shows cooperative smart farming game and also shows the game analysis
    in same section. Section V presents proposed fair strategy. Section VI discuss
    proposed implementation framework for enabling CSF using real-world cloud-enabled
    IoT platform. Section VII concludes the paper with future research directions.
    SECTION II. Related Work In this section, we discuss the relevant work in perspective
    of three specific areas - cooperative smart farming (CSF), security and privacy
    issues in CSFs, and game theory application in the context of smart farming. A.
    Cooperative Smart Farming Farming has always been a community activity and in
    its truest sense a communal one that includes a participatory process. Therefore,
    even though individual farms operating alone may be efficient revenue maximizers,
    it is still an evident fact that significant benefits can accrue to those participating
    in a cooperative bloc [7]. Similar to cooperation in the traditional sense of
    farming, where farmers share resources such as seeds and equipment; a CSF scenario
    in the technical sense involves sharing of data collected by numerous sensors,
    devices, and other resources. The reasons to indulge in CSF are not only economic
    ones but also ones of security. For instance, the participating farms share data
    which can lead to better crop output. Meanwhile, the data shared can also be analyzed
    to figure out threats to crops and protect them from damage [8]. Such critical
    insights are only possible with the help of IoT devices that relay data from the
    farms in the cooperative hosted on cloud or edge servers. These farms reinforced
    with IoT devices come under the purview of smart farms which have been researched
    in many studies [9], [10]. Smart farms also employ remote sensing techniques to
    keep track of the covered land, monitor crop health and even classify weeds [11].
    Moreover, the use of technology in smart farms has been so far advanced as distinguishing
    between different plowing techniques and classifying them according to plowing
    depth [12]. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has been consistent in smart
    farms along with the use of IoT devices. An emerging setting for smart and cooperative
    farming is indoor farming, especially greenhouses, where IoT devices that share
    data with the cloud have been utilized to replicate the results achieved in outdoor
    farms [13]. In terms of implementation, there have been several instantiations
    of smart and connected farming ecosystems. These smart farms have been fitted
    with a variety of IoT devices that can interact with each other and also with
    the users to run different tasks. Similarly, REST-APIs have been used to encourage
    the cooperative development of applications and solutions to speed up adoption
    of the concept of smart and cooperative farming [14]. Data Modeling has been another
    important tool used in smart farming to perform a range of tasks, such as the
    very basic ones like feed modeling to more environmentally responsible ones as
    reducing methane emissions [15]. With many IoT devices in place, there is a sizable
    generation of continuous data streams in smart and cooperative farms. Big data
    technologies play an important role in the collection, storage and analysis of
    data and its conversion to meaningful information, which can in turn help in overall
    farm management and streamlining of farm processes [16]. Fig. 1: Cooperative Smart
    Farming Architecture Show All With regard to the advances in smart farms, AI techniques
    are increasingly being used in the smart farming domain today. ML models and techniques
    too have begun to play a prominent role in enhancing the capabilities of smart
    farms. Image processing using artificial neural networks have been used to monitor
    plants both during growth and harvest periods for detecting diseases as well as
    for grading them [13]. In addition to plants, ML has also been used to predict
    soil and land properties even the propensity of droughts to occur [17]. Also,
    with respect to autonomous operations in smart farms, models have been developed
    to minimize the instances of human intervention required for monitoring crops
    [18]. Another interesting application of AI capabilities in the smart farming
    context has been for weed classification where spectral images collected by small
    Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have been used to identify the weeds that may pose
    a danger to the surrounding plants or crops [19]. B. Security and Privacy issues
    on Cooperative Smart Farming The use of IoT devices in the smart farms has surely
    transformed the cooperative farming landscape, however it has also ushered in
    the risks attached to such devices. These risks translate to the various security
    and privacy risks that target IoT devices in general. Since a major part of the
    infrastructure of a cooperative smart farm is built around participating farms
    sharing data with each other, if a particular data source becomes corrupted, then
    it can have far reaching implications for all the farms in the bloc. Privacy by
    design is critical in such scenarios to protect the privacy sensitive information
    of any member farm from being subject to unwanted disclosure [20]. Also, security
    of the data being circulated in CSF bloc is equally important, essentially with
    respect to the three triad - confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If
    this data is tampered with, then it can lead to devastating consequences such
    as wiping out entire crop harvest or withering of plants because of inefficient
    application of fertilizers. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure security and privacy
    be robust in smart farms. Security and privacy issues in CSF architecture relate
    to authorization and trust, authentication and sever communication as well as
    compliance and regulations [4], [21]. Access control plays an important part in
    regulating the level of access to the many different IoT devices that may be present
    within CSF architecture. Federated access control reference model [22] is used
    to enhance the privacy of security of big data platforms. Similarly, there have
    been prior work on access control models for developing flexible access control
    models for securing access and data communication in IoT [23]–[26], and cloud-enabled
    IoT platforms [27]–[29]. Data is transferred quite a bit among the cooperative
    smart farms as well as shared with the cloud servers responsible for aggregating
    the data for analysis. To combat these security threats there can be a number
    of solutions. A potential one solution is the application of Blockchain, with
    which the data transferred among the farms can be verified for its validity [30],
    and another solution is based on trustworthy evaluation framework [31]. Also,
    with the increasing popularity of smart farms, another security challenge that
    arises is that these farms inadvertently play host to a plethora of security challenges
    [32]. However, enforcement of data transfer agreements and verifying the approved
    learning received from the cloud servers is a very important task in the connected
    farm system. Further, the issue of security and privacy in smart farming is not
    only restricted to data alone but encompasses both the human and technology components
    of CSF architecture. It is important that the farm owners are aware and trained
    on the latest threats that may pose a danger to their farms. On the other hand,
    the technology providers and vendors should provide end users with applications
    and software that is free from flaws and secure by design [33]. To enhance the
    security in smart farms, researchers have also looked at using a private cloud
    infrastructure that combines data from heterogeneous sources to provide privacy
    secure data analytic capabilities to individual farms [34]. Such a solution can
    be ported into a collaborative mechanism that can effectively serve participating
    smart farms in a cooperative bloc. Ensuring proper device authentication of smart
    devices with low computing power, that are embedded in connected farm systems,
    can also act as an effective deterrent against cyber-attacks and minimize security
    violations [35]. Fig. 2: Cooperative Smart Farming Model Show All C. Game Theory
    in Smart Farming This paper [36] investigates the utilization of game theory models
    for automated analysis of hyperspectral imagery data. The authors discuss two
    models on feature-level fusion and decision fusion for hypertemporal-hyperspectral
    datasets, and both models are implemented under the assumption where all players
    are rational. In agriculture, this research [37] presents game theory model for
    decision making in risky situations. In beginning, a farmer makes plans for obtaining
    feasible goals and then simply carry out the plans. Later, he/she can face various
    uncertain issues in agriculture production. This study [38] provides possible
    solutions to actual decision problems of Iowa farmers. This paper [39] deals with
    the application of game theory with solution to handle an agricultural economics
    problem. This study claims to establish Nash Equilibrium for an agricultural company
    that is considered together with its three sub-units. Gupta et al. [40] presents
    a novel fair strategy for collaborative deep learning game, where all mobile edge
    devices [41] choose any strategy to make own profit. The past studies show that
    no research has analyzed the farm’s rational behavior in CSF. Therefore, we develop
    a game model for farms in CSF and analyze the game. SECTION III. Cooperative Smart
    Farming Cooperatives are formal corporation which are financed, controlled, and
    owned by members for correlative advantage [42]–[44]. These cooperative (co-op)
    work is based on membership agreement, which has operational rules along with
    conditions and provide the benefit of shared resources. Such cooperatives operate
    in different sectors, such as grocery suppliers, water supplies, credit unions,
    utilities, farm suppliers, transportation and childcare. According to United States
    Department of Agriculture (USDA) [45], the importance of co-ops is more meaningful
    in the rural communities. Figure 1 presents the multi-layer architecture of CSF,
    where physical layer has Internet of Agriculture Things (IoAT) devices, the edge
    layer provides local real-time computation and analysis needed for smart resources,
    and cloud layer comprises of cloud services and co-op level. A. A Use Case We
    present a use case of multiple participating smart farms in a CSF bloc which is
    based on a game theory-based model. Participating smart farms are rational choice
    makers and will only become members of CSF bloc if they get tangible benefits
    from it. These benefits have to be more beneficial than would normally accrue
    to the farms if they operated alone based on their own capabilities. In this setting
    as shown in Figure 2, CSF bloc provides its members, Farm A and Farm B, the benefits
    from a shared ML model. This model can provide numerous insights related to various
    factors, such as plant and soil health, soil and water quality, and crop output
    and yield management information, based on data collected from Farm A and Farm
    B. Therefore, if a smart farm wishes to use the information provided by the model,
    then it has to register and join CSF bloc so that it can avail of the learning
    from the model. This ML model is trained on the cloud or edge server with data
    that is transferred to it from the participating farms. Generally, we assume that
    the larger the dataset collected from different farms the better ML model will
    be; thus, there will be an inherent incentive for the participating farms to become
    a member of CSF bloc and share their data in order to get better insights about
    their farming practices and in turn get more profits in the long run. Fig. 3:
    Cooperative Smart Farm Model - Threat Scenario 1 Show All If a smart farm does
    not need the information being provided by the model, then it will not choose
    to join CSF bloc. For example, if a smart farm needs information about soil moisture
    or soil pH levels and the model only provides insights about water quality and
    yield management, then the farm will not participate in the bloc. Similarly, if
    earlier ML model in a bloc used to provide the soil moisture information, but
    going forward, due to a lack of good quality data the model stops providing that
    specific information, then a smart farm can choose to defect from CSF bloc. Also,
    if a smart farm is technically superior and has abundant data and ML capabilities,
    then it will not join a CSF bloc. Instead it will operate alone, relying on its
    own capabilities. Similarly, if a participating smart farm acquires such superior
    capabilities while being a member of a CSF bloc then, it can choose to defect
    from the bloc. However, we envision that these scenarios are only fringe options
    that depends on different types of participating farms and may or may not be seen
    often in the context of our smart farms based CSF architecture. B. Threat Model
    1) Scenario 1 In a CSF bloc, there are two farms – Farm A and Farm B. Farm A has
    various sensors, smart devices, robust data collection procedures in place, sophisticated
    instruments that collects high-quality data with regard to crop yield per hectare,
    soil moisture, water quality, irrigation schedules etc. Farm B does not have such
    advanced sensors, devices, and methods to collect good quality data. Both farms
    share data with a cloud ML model with the instruments they have installed on their
    farms. Figure 3 shows this scenario. The data collection (what metrics are collected),
    storage (where are they storing and where – IoT Hub or Edge computing servers,
    or cloud) and sharing schedule (data is sent hourly, or daily or weekly) may be
    different or standardized for different participating farms. The cloud ML model
    uses data across different farms and trains model to make predictions regarding
    pesticide application, seeds needed per hectare, minimum irrigation levels needed
    to ensure good crop yield, predict scarcity of soil nutrients etc. The ML model
    shares the data with all the farms irrespective of their size or quality of the
    data contribution. In this scenario, Farm A has good devices, data collected from
    those devices, and resources; however, Farm B does not have good farm devices,
    data, and resources. Therefore, the ML model should process the data from Farms
    A and Farm B and then provide outputs/insights based on the quality of data that
    each farm shared rather than providing both with the same insights, as is the
    general case with the ML model learning. Figure 3 shows both current learning
    and insights sharing mechanism with solid green lines, and our proposed mechanism
    with dashed lines. Fig. 4: Cooperative Smart Farm - Threat Scenario 2 Show All
    2) Scenario 2 Figure 4 depicts the second threat scenario where one of the farms
    could have malicious intents. Here, the scenario also consists of two farms, Farm
    A and Farm B, where Farm A is a technologically advanced farm compared to Farm
    B and Farm A provides better quality data to the ML model, similar to scenario
    1. Now, Farm B decides to act rogue and stop sharing the entire data it collects,
    or does not replace outdated or broken IoT devices, or Farm B has malicious intentions
    and does not collect good quality data. For instance, the malicious intent can
    either be competitors trying to sabotage a CSF and smart farms participating in
    that CSF, or data injection attacks from hackers for ruining crops for other farms
    and their ML model outputs. In scenario 1, Farm B still gets the ML model’s prediction
    without actually cooperating and participating in the smart farming architecture.
    In scenario 2, Farm B actively tries to sabotage the whole CSF infrastructure
    by compromising the data source from which the ML model is trained. With our game
    theory-based fair strategy approach (described in later section) proposed in this
    paper, we try to solve this problem and ensure that the participating smart farms
    are equal and honest in all respects. As a consequence of providing high-quality
    and true data, the smart farms receive models and their outputs/insights that
    accurately represent the aggregate learning from CSF bloc. C. Rationality Assumption
    Prior research in smart farming [46] have presented cyber-attacks on smart farming
    infrastructure where farmers or IoT devices are controlled by adversary. Malicious
    participants could arbitrarily deviate from suggested protocol in CSF or could
    arbitrarily drop communication between edge gateways and cloud. However, here
    we assume that farms are honest in a selfish environment. In the context of this
    paper, rationality means that a rational farm earns maximum profit by collaboration
    or individual modeling in CSF. SECTION IV. Cooperative Smart Farming Game In this
    section, we present a game model of CSF with multiple member farms in selfish
    environment. This game model involves with N-players and is addressing the threat
    scenario 1 as discussed in III. This game model refers as a cooperative smart
    farming game G. In this game, IoT devices send their generated data to centralized
    cloud where data supports all the member farms through ML models. Co-op allows
    to aggregate only that data, which is generated from members of CSF and builds
    ML model for AI-assisted applications. This updated global ML model provide insight
    to all participating member farms via AI-assisted application, where exists a
    social dilemma for all defection behavior. Table 1 shows game approach between
    two players, one has high-quality data and other has low-quality data. List of
    symbols are shown in Table 2. A. Game Theoretic Model Game theory allows for modeling
    situations of conflict and for predicting the behavior of participants when they
    interact with each other. In CSF game G, farms which sign a co-op agreement to
    be part of CSF are participants. They interact with each other through co-op cloud
    level without having any knowledge about each other. The Game G is a static game,
    because all participants must choose their strategy. The Game G is a tuple (P,
    S, U), where P is the set of players, S is the set of strategies and U is the
    set of payoff values. Players (P ): The set of players P= ∑ N i=1 P i corresponds
    to the set of member farms which signed co-op agreement and allows to send generated
    data from their IoT devices through edge gateways to build ML model in CSF game
    G. Strategy (S): Each participant Pi can choose between two actions si (i) Cooperative
    (CP ) or (ii) Defective (DF ). Hence the set of strategies in this game is S ={CP,DF
    }. Strategy of each participant Pi determines whether Pi participates in CSF.
    In particular, if a participant Pi plays CP strategy, i.e., the member farm allows
    IoT devices to send the generated data to centralized cloud and extract model
    results via AI-assisted applications. In cooperative strategy, participant pays
    full cost. In contrast, if a participant Pi neither sends the generated data through
    IoT devices to the cloud nor utilize the global ML model, i.e., the member farm
    Pi plays DF strategy. Thus, participants saves various costs including membership
    costs co, communication costs cm, cm′ and storage cost cs. Here, this participant
    is not part of CSF and builds ML model individually. Payoff (U): The goal of each
    participants in CSF game G is to maximize their utility, which is a function of
    the accuracy and its costs. In this game, we do not consider any malicious or
    threat activities from players; hence, the accuracy based on AI assisted application
    is benefit for each player. The players pay various costs including communication
    costs cm, cm′, storage cost cs, and membership cost co, and also pay penalty cp
    if any player breaks co-op membership agreement. Total cost c t i to participate
    in CSF can be characterized as c t i = c o + c p + c m + c m ′ + c s (1) View
    Source TABLE I: Game Table Between Two Players Here, the benefit and the cost
    are not on the same scale as the first depends on the accuracy of ML model while
    the latter on different types of associated costs. To make them comparable, we
    introduce a coefficient: the benefit is multiplied with B. Now, we compute the
    payoff of player Pi in this game. If we assume that the player Pi is cooperative,
    i.e., Pi∈CP. Similarly, if Pi is defective, i.e., Pi∈DF, and these payoffs can
    be defined as follows. u i (CP)=B( a co−op )−( c o + c p + c m + c m ′ + c s )
    u i (DF)=B(a)−( c plocal ) (2) (3) View Source TABLE II: List of Symbols Fig.
    5: A Sample of Model Attributes Show All Based on the above calculated utilities,
    we analyze the game G as discussed in the game analysis. The most fundamental
    game-theoretic concept, Nash Equilibrium, which is introduced by John Nash [47]
    is used to solve strategic behavior of participants. Definition 1. A Nash Equilibrium
    is a concept of game theory where none of the players can unilaterally change
    their strategy to increase their payoff. In a non-cooperative game, players do
    not have any motivation to deviate unilaterally from the given strategy. The prisoner’s
    dilemma is a standard example to analyze a game and shows that two rational players
    cooperate, come out with best outcome, and the players do not cooperate with one
    another, then they choose defecting strategy in the hope of attaining individual
    gain at the rival’s expense. In prisoners’ dilemma defecting strategy strictly
    dominates the cooperation strategy. Hence, the only Nash Equilibrium in prisoners’
    dilemma, is a mutual defection. Fig. 6: Proposed Implementation of Cooperative
    Smart Farming (CSFs) in AWS cloud Show All Based on the cost and benefit of player
    to build ML model, we build a CSF game model G. In the following theorems, we
    show that the CSF game G is a public good game. Theorem 1. In cooperative smart
    farming game G, if each participant builds its local machine learning model individually,
    then we can establish All-Defective strategy profile as a Nash Equilibrium. Proof.
    Let us consider all N participants follow defective-DF strategy where all participants
    neither send their generated data from IoT devices through gateways to cloud,
    nor upload any updated ML model/extract any results from cloud, i.e., no membership
    fees co, no communication between IoT devices and cloud. So, participants do not
    pay any communication costs cm, cm′, and storage cost cs. Now each participant
    Pi trains local data sets Di to build its ML model individually and pays only
    computation cost cplocal. None of participants cannot change his strategy profile
    unilaterally. Let us assume if a participant deviates from defect-DF strategy
    to cooperate-CP strategy unilaterally, then participant will pay some costs (co+
    cm + cm′ +cs + cp), which is greater than cplocal. The payoff of cooperate-CP
    strategy is less than defect-DF strategy, so All-DF is a Nash equilibrium profile
    and G is a public good game. Theorem 2 shows that we can never enforce an All-Cooperative
    CP strategy in game G, and therefore, we could not establish a Nash Equilibrium.
    Theorem 2. In cooperative smart farming game G, if each participant builds its
    local ML model, then we cannot establish All-Cooperative strategy profile as a
    Nash Equilibrium. Proof. We first assume that all N participants are members of
    CSF (i.e., All-cooperative CP strategy profile) and pays mandatory costs (membership
    cost, communication costs, and storage cost) and optional cost (penalty cost).
    We can compute the payoff of each participant Pi by Equation (2). Hence, if a
    participant will deviate from the cooperation and play defection unilaterally,
    its payoff would be equal to Equation (3), which is always greater than cooperative
    payoff. Hence, each participant has incentive to deviate unilaterally and increases
    its payoff. Then, the All cooperate-CP strategy profile is never a Nash Equilibrium.
    SECTION V. Proposed Approach - A Fair Strategy We present the proposed model to
    ensure member farms in CSF can be maintained with a fair-game strategy. Figure
    3 and Figure 4 present CSF models of use case threat scenario 1 and scenario 2,
    which we discussed in section III. Our goal is to design a mechanism for eliciting
    cooperation in CSF and solves the issue discussed in scenario 1 where one farm
    (Farm A) has advanced and good quality devices and provide good quality data.
    The proposed fair strategy enforces member farms for cooperation in CSF; however,
    Theorem 1 and 2 proves that member farm defect from CSF game, i.e., after some
    number of iterations, member farm will not be part a of CSF if they will not get
    any benefit from other member farms. The quality of each dataset of each participant
    is calculated based on data attributes at co-op level. The generated data is classified
    using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and a result of sample data attributes
    is shown in Figure 5. This shows different categories of data items and hierarchy
    of attributes - soil data, irrigation data, yield data, and sharing schedule for
    data and resources. Each of these categories are further broken down into other
    attributes that provide detailed information about these attributes. For instance,
    soil data include moisture and nutrient content, irrigation data include water
    quality and watering schedule, etc. Based on such identified attributes for a
    ML model, we can define the data being collected and transmitted by smart farms
    to the CSF is quality data or not. As shown in Table 1, the best strategy is to
    classify the smart farms based on the quality of data they provide to the model
    and co-op, such as high-quality data farms should participate in high-quality
    CSF, and low-quality data farms can be grouped together and should participate
    in low-quality CSF. We believe that this strategy will allow the smart farms to
    co-operate in CSFs and take maximum benefit from it, and can reduce the problem
    of defective farms. However, further research on data attributes for ML models
    to efficiently classify the smart farms is necessary. We plan to focus on this
    aspect in our future work. In the context of the CSF game G, before the start
    of the game, each participant has to choose his strategy between CP and DG to
    play the CSF game G. However, in the beginning of this game, each participant
    is in dilemma to choose strategy, which can depend on other participant’s strategy.
    In CSF, each member farm does not know about the quality and quantity of other
    participant’s data. Here, we propose a novel fair strategy employing K-means clustering
    at co-op cloud level. K-means clustering is an unsupervised ML technique, whose
    purpose is to segment a data set into K clusters. The co-op cloud will create
    clusters based on quality and quantity of their dataset to enforce in CSF game
    G. Algorithm 1 shows our proposed strategy using data attributes (which would
    be defined for qualitative and quantitative data by co-ops) and K-means clustering.
    Using this algorithm and classified dataset, we can generate sustainable CSFs
    without the issue defective farms. Algorithm 1 Proposed Fair Strategy SECTION
    VI. Proposed Implementation In this section, we present a proposed implementation
    for CSF using proposed fair strategy utilizing AWS cloud and IoT platform, shown
    in Figure 6. In CSF, various smart member farms collaborate with each other. As
    shown in Figure 6, the data is collected from different smart member farms, which
    need to be classified using SVM algorithm. This proposed implementation utilizes
    AWS IoT core2 in cloud, AWS Greengrass3 running on edge gateways (e.g., Raspberry
    Pi enabled gateway) that can enable edge computing as required, and IoT devices/things
    corresponding to specific use cases requirements. The edge gateway can be enabled
    using Raspberry Pi4 that host the AWS Greengrass deployment, and customized lambda5
    functions that can run on the gateway for edge communication and computation,
    sending notifications, or enforcing access control and privacy policies. AWS Greengrass
    allows farmers to securely connect their smart devices at the edge of the network
    to gather data. When connectivity is re-established, the data will synchronize
    with AWS cloud and its IoT services using MQTT/HTTP protocols. For enabling a
    secure architecture, AWS IoT core provides mutual authentication based on certificates
    and encryption for secure data transfer and also enable different access control
    levels, which have been discussed in [27], [28]. The data can be stored at AWS
    cloud storage and be analyzed at the co-op level for classified member farms based
    on the quality and quantity of their data attributes. The member farms cluster
    will be created using proposed fair strategy at co-op cloud level, then the member
    farms will be part of CSF. AWS IoT analytic service can be used to analyze the
    data using specific ML models and provide meaningful insights to the member smart
    farms through the smart farm applications as shown in the top layer of the proposed
    implementation architecture. SECTION VII. Conclusion In this paper, we present
    a system model of cooperative smart farm (CSF) and introduce the problem of strategic
    behavior of farmers in CSF. We analyze rational behavior of member farms in CSF
    using game theory model. We also analyze the Nash Equilibrium strategy profile
    for each scenario, where member farms are enforced to cooperate based on some
    data attributes identified by CSFs and using our proposed fair strategy in CSF.
    This work presents an extensive understanding of non-cooperative behavior of member
    farms in CSF. For future work, we plan to do further research on data attributes
    identification for ML models that can be used by CSFs to better classify the smart
    farms based on the quality and quantity of data. We also plan to implement the
    model with farming data set and evaluate the accuracy of ML model using proposed
    fair strategy. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless integration of automated
    irrigation components. Interoperability ensures that different components can
    communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization provides a common
    framework for data formats, protocols, and interfaces. Ensuring interoperability
    and standardization is crucial for addressing the challenges of data integration,
    enabling real-time decision-making, and achieving scalability and efficiency in
    automated irrigation management systems.

    IEEE Conference Location: Solan, India SECTION I. Introduction “Internet of computers”
    allows users to communicate and exchange information in an efficient way. While
    at one end, processing power and storage of computing devices are increasing;
    technology also is making devices smaller and cheaper, making them pervasive,
    wearable and mobile. These small devices are fitted with sensors and actuators
    that make them smarter (can sense, respond, communicate etc.). These devices collaborate
    among themselves and with the Web, which aligns them to be part of the “Web of
    Things” architecture. A recent estimate from Ericsson says that there will be
    more of Things connected to the Internet than users. The Advertisement on the
    Business Week Technology, June 29, 2009, reads, “By 2020 - Internet of Things
    would connect tens of billions of devices wirelessly”. According to [8], the Internet
    of Things is evolving more than its core (e.g. routers and servers) and the quickly
    growing fringe (e.g. personal computers and smart phones) to trillions of small
    embedded devices in the physical world. Both the citations view connecting of
    Things to the Internet at the IP layer of the TCP/IP stack, thereby referring
    to “Internet of Things”. This paper focuses on the application layer of the stack
    and hence we refer to it as “Web of Things”. It can be seen that billions of devices
    would generate huge amounts of data that needs to be managed efficiently and automatically.
    Unlike, the traditional Internet of Computers where humans are directly or indirectly
    involved in the management of data. Hence, huge engineering challenges are involved
    in making this vision come true. It invloves scalability, security, interoperability,
    semantics and more in maintaining and regulating such a network. Web services
    enable disparate, heterogeneous environments to communicate among each other effectively.
    They can be realized by either Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) approach or
    Representational State Transfer (RESTful) approach. SOAP is an xml based Remote
    Procedure Call (RPC) solution while the latter is a much more lightweight solution
    where resources are managed by HTTP interactions. SOAP is the standard used for
    exchanging messages in an interoperable manner for Web Services in Enterprises
    providing features like security, transactions, scalability etc. Though lightweight
    solutions based on SOAP, like Device Profile for Web Services (DPWS) exist, they
    are still heavy for constrained environments with low power, low bandwidth, low
    ROM/RAM. SOAP wraps the the header(where most of the required features are specified)
    and the payload in its envelope to be transported over TCP every time. RESTful
    style is more suitable for embedded applications compared to SOAP due to its advantages
    like minimal parsing complexity, statelessness, tight integration with HTTP and
    less overhead [8]. Although RESTful style is light, they are not totally suitable
    for realizing the vision of WoT (Web of Things) for following reasons: (i) synchronous
    in nature (ii) header compression overhead (iii) inefficient over lossy wireless
    multihop-networks (iv) pull based. As a solution to these problems in constrained
    environments, the IETF Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) Working Group is
    developing Web protocol for embedded web services, called as Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) [9]. In simple terms CoAP can be seen similar to HTTP, following
    the REST architectural style, but geared towards M2M (Machine 2 Machine) applications,
    as it is asynchronous in nature working on top of UDP. The CoAP protocol is in
    its draft version-II, expiring on January 2013 as of this paper. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows: Section II provides some related work with
    respect to Web Services on Constrained Environments. Section III gives an overview
    of CoAP and 6LoWPAN. Section IV describes our proposed design based on CoAP for
    a real-time application. Section V has experimental results. Section VI has conclusion
    and future works. SECTION II. Related Work In traditional Internet of computers,
    Web Service is the proven efficient solution for interoperability among heterogeneous
    environments. RESTful Web service fit better than SOAP based ones as a solution
    for Constrained M2M applications. [6] is a RESTful 6LoWPAN based application framework
    for smart homes addressing service discovery and service description. Also a syndication
    mechanism based on RESTful messaging (RMS) system is specified. The response times
    of web service (REST-based) requests is very less compared to SOAP based one [11].
    A REST based implementation for home device control application on a 100Mbps LAN
    environment is shown in [2]. [3] demonstrates WoTs using Sun SPOTs, PLOGGS and
    RFID providing a holistic view for a scalable and efficient resource oriented
    architecture based on REST. Data platform as a middleware between physical objects
    and the virtual digital world is designed for vehicular networks [10]. [1] (earlier
    known as pachube), is a REST based cloud for monitoring and controlling smart
    objects. We see that all these methods are based on REST architecture. SECTION
    III. Overview of 6LoWPAN and CoAP 6LoWPAN networks generally have throughput of
    10s of kbps, and motes in these environments quite often have small ROM/RAM with
    8-bit microcontrollers. Essentially these networks use IPv6 over Low Power Wireless
    Area Networks. 6LoWPAN, specified in RFC 4919 and 4944 became a IETF standard
    in 2007. It does stateless header compression of IPV6 headers in hexadecimal,
    from around 48 Bytes to 6 Bytes giving room of around 100 Bytes for the payload,
    for any low power radio standards. Also, the edge router compresses the known
    network information, leaving only the unique MAC identifiers for the individual
    motes. This is lossless too, as the entire address is got back when exiting the
    network. 6LoWPAN makes use of a Neighbor Discovery scheme that is node initiated
    with a node registration mechanism and supports Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
    and recovery. Mobility in 6LoWPAN networks may be either at micro, macro or at
    network level, which are handled through mobile IPv6 and Network Mobility (Nemo).
    Routing is supported at both L2 and L3 levels. The IETF Routing over Low Power
    and lossy Networks (ROLL) Working Group has specified an efficient protocol for
    Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). It is called Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
    which is a RFC standard 6550, March 2012. The 6LoWPAN architecture is shown in
    Fig. 1 [7] Fig. 1. The 6LoWPAN Architecture Show All Fig. 2. Layering in CoAP
    Show All The work in progress CoAP protocol by the IETFs CoRE Working Group is
    a web protocol (like HTTP) optimized for M2M applications in 6LoWPAN networks.
    CoAP supports the following features: it is a web protocol, uses UDP binding with
    optional reliability, has a low header overhead (fixed 4 bytes), URI and content-type
    support, has proxy and caching capabilities, security binding to Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS). CoAP (Fig. 2) logically have two parts: a messaging model
    for asynchronous exchange of messages over UDP and a request/response interaction
    model. CoAP interaction is similar to the client/server model (CoAP end points).
    Fig. 3 shows an example of a simple message flow for a GET request by a client
    and the server responding back with a piggybacked message. Unlike HTTP, CoAP operates
    over UDP, with reliable unicast and best effort multicast support. A CoAP endpoint
    keeps track of open Confirmable messages it sent that are waiting for a response.
    It provides simple congestion control through exponential-backoff mechanism. In
    cases when a Server might need longer time to obtain the representation of resource,
    it sends an immediate ACK stopping the client from further retransmissions. Fig.
    3. CON request and piggybacked response Show All SECTION IV. MOTIVATION AND CONTRIBUTIONS
    Motivation behind efficient interoperable Web Service approach is the automatic
    management of systems in areas like power grids, industrial automation, logistics,
    environmental intelligence, health care, etc. Work done by Dominique Guinard [3]
    featuring the “energie visible” project is a major breakthrough towards an efficient
    Web of Things architecture, focusing on interoperablility. Jing He et al. propose
    a smart web service based on Context of Things [5] using semantics and reasoning
    for a plant-watering application. Although REST principles are used for building
    smart Web Service, we can not make use of the service effectively in a 6LoWPAN
    network consisting of constrained devices. So, we propose to use semantic and
    composition principles for smart web services. We extend this by supporting most
    tiniest of IPv6 enabled devices. We present a modified framework where the communication
    between end-users and sensors is more efficient. We also propose an efficient
    Publish/Subscribe mechanism to notify the resource state changes to the users.
    SECTION V. AN ASYNCHRONOUS/SYNCHRONOUS REST BASED DESIGN FOR SMARTER WEB OF THINGS
    APPLICATIONS The proposed framework is shown in Fig. 4. It is an extension to
    the Smart Web Service based on Context of things proposed by [5]. We replace RESTful
    Web Service with CoAP. The raw data sensed(Fig. 4), is given more insight when
    added with contextual information and domain knowledge bases. A sensor event detection
    service uses these semantic services to infer whether watering is required for
    the plant or not. We propose to use an asynchronous approach with an effective
    PUSH mechanism. It can also be extended for applications involving multiple sensors
    from different vendors, interacting among each other and with the Web. Section
    “A” shows our proposed framework for M2M applications and “B” an improved PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE
    mechanism. Fig. 4. An extended framework supporting tiny embedded devices Show
    All A. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR M2M APPLICATIONS Work by J. He et al. uses HTTP
    throughout for message exchanges and therefore uses TCP and thus synchronous in
    nature. This may not be suitable for sensors with 8 bit microcontrollers, with
    low power, low ROM/RAM, and low throughput. Moreover, although the eventing service
    triggers the actuator, clients still need to poll. We propose a design that uses
    both synchronous and asynchronous transmissions supporting tiny embedded devices
    yet making use of semantics and mashups making them smarter. A sensor is assumed
    to be IPv6-ready (with a micro implementation of the IP stack) that makes use
    of the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer. Many such devices (even for 8 bit microcontrollers)
    with 6LoWPAN support exist in the market. We make use of CoAP to transfer the
    message from the sensor rather than HTTP. CoAP uses UDP, thus asynchronous in
    nature. The sensor data passes through a CoAP-HTTP mapper before it is given contextual
    information and is composed. We call this mapper rather than a gateway, as the
    conversion overhead is less than a typical gateway, and the CoAP specification
    has mechanisms for this mapping as well. Web services composition and addition
    of contextual information make use of TCP over IPv4/v6 (through tunneling) and
    the output inferred is fed to a HTTP-CoAP mapper which notifies the Thing about
    the action required to be performed. This information is in turn notified to the
    client if he has subscribed to the Thing. The Client may then act according to
    the application. In the case of plant-watering scenario, he may send a CoAP message
    that waters the plant. Fig. 4, shows our extended framework. B. IMPROVED PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE
    MECHANISM Our approach for Publish/Subscribe mechanism is a modified strategy
    based on the work in progress “Observing” [4] protocol extension of CoAP, for
    observing resource changes. The CoAP message format (Fig. 5) with fixed header
    size of 4 Bytes, allows options (if any) to be specified, along with the payload.
    Logically, CoAP uses a messaging model and a request/response model. The messaging
    model takes care of the asynchronous interactions and the latter uses method and
    response codes for request/response interactions. Four types of messages are defined
    in the protocol. Confirmable (CON), Non-Confirmable (NON), Acknowledgement (ACK),
    and Reset (RST). A CON message needs to be acknowledged and a NON message need
    not be. Fig. 5. CoAP Message Format Show All Fig. 6. Observe option Show All Rather
    than more of server controlled nature for the frequency of notification messages
    (clients can though custom control using parameterized resource uris) in Observing,
    our approach make use of timestamps / notification period, specified in addition
    to the observe option, along with the request, reducing the number of transmissions
    involved (Acknowledge-ments from the observer and CON messages by the subject
    and retransmissions by the subject). We introduce an option called as duration
    that is used in our proposed design. Using this option along with the Observe
    option (for applications where notifications are required for a small interval
    of time, say every 5 minutes for 30 minutes) is very efficient reducing the number
    of message exchanges. Without duration, if an observer (still interested with
    a resource) forgets to acknowledge a response from the subject, he is removed
    from the observers list eventually. The observer re-registers his interest again.
    Clients (Observers) interested in receiving notifications of state changes in
    resources need to register their interests with the server (subject). How often
    observers are notified and under what conditions resources are changed is controlled
    by the subject. But for how long an observer is interested with a resource may
    be decided by the observer. An observer interested with a subject sends a CON
    GET request along with the observe option (Elective option No. 10) whose value
    is zero on transmission and is ignored on reception. The Observe option is shown
    in Fig. 6 An observer, in addition to the observe option in a GET request specifies
    another Elective option: duration (No. 22) (22 is not a IANA [Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority] consideration yet/may be added to the CoAP options Number Registry)
    whose value is an uint that specifies a number representing the duration (in secs)
    the observer is interested with the resource. A subject (with the obs attribute
    set) receiving such a request, knows that the observer is interested in subscribing
    to the resource and that the observer is interested with the resource for the
    specified duration. It then adds the observer to its list of observers. The subject,
    in the ACK message along with the payload also sends a notification message to
    the observer indicating the client that it has been subscribed. The subject keeps
    sending notifications for any resource changes according to a notification frequency
    (Max-Age) determined by the subject, for the specified duration in the GET request.
    If an observer doesn''t like the notification interval set by Max-Age option (getting
    frequent or less-frequent notifications) of the subject, he may at any point in
    time send a NON GET to the same resource specifying a different value for the
    Max-Age option. The subject receiving such a request understands that the Max-Age
    option should be set to this new value as specified in GET request. Every further
    notification is sent according to this changed value. Notifications are sent only
    as NONs. An observer may however unsubscribe for notifications from resources
    prior to the duration expiry by sending a NON GET request with duration set to
    zero or with no observe option, or a RST for a NON notification by the subject
    (may attempt more than once). The subject then deletes the observer from its list
    of observers. This approach has the advantage of minimizing the number of exchanges
    done between an observer and a subject. In Observing, a subject sends the notifications
    in both CONs and NONs. It is through CONs, now and then, wherein a subject ensures
    that an observer is still interested in receiving notifications. If the observers
    do not send an ACK, the subject assumes that the observer is not interested in
    receiving further notifications and deletes the observer from its observers list.
    An observer interested with further notifications should send an ACK back to the
    subject. Also, retransmissions occur at exponentially increasing intervals till
    an ACK is received. Algorithm 1 illustrates (ignoring dropouts and timeouts for
    simplicity) our publish-subscribe mechanism. SECTION VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
    Experiments were carried out to evaluate the advantages of CoAP over HTTP for
    the proposed design. We used Cooja, Wireshark and Copper on Contiki 2.6 to perform
    our experiments on emulated TMote skys and found that CoAP for WoTs are more efficient
    than using HTTP. Fig. 7 shows motes exchanging CoAP messages. Mote 2 is a CoAP
    server, 1 a border router and 3 through 19 being clients requesting for the resources
    in 2 in a multihop fashion. Fig. 8 shows the motes making the requests to the
    server. Fig. 9 shows the copper browser accessing a resource on a CoAP server.
    The Copper plugin for Firefox can be used to monitor and manage the resources
    efficiently over CoAP. It supports resource discovery, GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
    Fig. 10 shows a NON for a periodic push resource, with an ACK being sent for an
    earlier CON. Fig. 11 shows a CON for a periodic push resource, with an ACK being
    sent for an earlier CON. ACKs from client are generated even after the client
    cancels the observation. These are for the remaining CONs before cancel, which
    needs to be acknowledged. Fig. 12 shows push for the plant-watering monitoring
    server only with NONs. Users may cancel the observation if not interested, where
    a RST for the same resource is sent and the server removes the client from the
    observer''s list. Fig. 13 shows the RST sent from the client. Fig. 14 shows the
    action taken using the actuator to water the plant when required. Fig. 15 and
    Fig. 16 shows the power utilization of the motes with and without CoAP. Even with
    skys “ON” 100 percent, Radio Duty Cycling (RDC) is more efficient with motes using
    CoAP mechanism than with HTTP. Also the round trip time is lesser. SECTION Algorithm

    VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK With many devices already being IP-enabled, Wireless
    Embedded Internet over IPv6 is predicted to be the next biggest revolution for
    automated, efficient, smarter and scalable Web of Things applications. Making
    this a reality involves numerous challenges like interoperability (device level/network
    level/application level), resource discovery, composability, security, etc. This
    paper deals with interoperability at the application level and provides a novel
    approach for an efficient, extendible, and smart, web service using CoAP as web
    protocol. CoAP has the following advantages: asynchronous in nature, designed
    for 6LoWPAN networks, multicasting, built-in resource discovery, and security.
    CoAP is analyzed for its efficiency over HTTP and has been experimentally evaluated
    for Round trip time and RDC. Further an algorithm for an efficient PUSH scheme
    has also been proposed and evaluated. Experimental results are encouraging to
    further improve the proposed work. Message exchange is still synchronous in parts
    of our design where semantics is involved. Efficient mehanisms to make this part
    of our design CoAP based could be a potential future work. Approaches like compression
    and fragmentation, use of microdata and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) can be
    explored. Fig. 15. TX and RX for 12 skys exchanging CoAP messages Show All Fig.

    Internet of Things (IoT) in the agriculture field provides crops-oriented data
    sharing and automatic farming solutions under single network coverage. The components
    of IoT collect the observable data from different plants at different points.

    ISSN Information: DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2021.3072908 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction
    Ensemble classification and pattern recognition for crop monitoring system (ECPRC)
    for plant disease recognition supports the farmer to take proactive decisions
    at the beginning point of the disease growth. Manual or visual recognition of
    these diseases from the observed plant portions (patterns) is inaccurate and inefficient.
    Moreover, the way of recognition requires a well-talented botanist. The issues
    that occur during conventional approaches can be rectified using ECPRC automatically.
    ECPRC focuses on the development of spontaneous recognition and classification
    of the crop diseases from the gathered high-resolution multispectral images, hyperspectral
    images, and stereotype images. For example, sugar beet leaves are usually infected
    by the diseases like Downy mildew, rust, Cercospora leaf spot, and phoma leaf
    spot. In this regard, Rao and Sridhar [1] and Sreekantha and Kavya [2] analyzed
    the intelligent crop monitoring and irrigation system to help in the growth of
    the plants. Shaikh et al. [15] analyzed the green technologies applications in
    the agriculture fields. Ray [3] and Tzounis et al. [7] explained the Internet
    of Things (IoT) future trends and architectures, respectively. IoT devices include
    high-resolution spectral cameras, agriculture sensors, and a Raspberry Pi controller
    which has been manipulating the plant images using machine learning (ML) algorithms.
    The images taken by the cameras are processed by extracting the leaf portions
    of the images. Then, the extracted leaf regions are segmented using Otsu’s method.
    Once the leaf regions are segmented, the disease portions are identified by using
    the Sobel edge detection approach for pointing disease-infected points in the
    leaves. These image processing techniques are used to spot the disease in the
    plant leaves but not to classify them efficiently. In order to achieve disease
    pattern-wise classifications, and recognition of diseases, many ML approaches
    are taken by the researchers. For example, agricultural researchers, Marjanin
    [4], focused on the problems and solutions of agriculture development. Further,
    the other researchers developed the techniques, such as support vector machine
    (SVM), PCA, convolutional neural network (CNN) [14], [17], [18], decision trees,
    backpropagation neural networks, and K -nearest neighbors’ classification for
    the disease classification. On the way, Lee et al. [8] pointed out phytophthora
    infest diseases on the tomatoes. They used various IoT components to build the
    system. Likewise, Xu et al. [9] applied SVM cotton mold diseases based on their
    visual marks. The main scope of this proposed ECPRC scheme is to develop a versatile
    crop disease monitoring system and IoT-based automatic decision-making system.
    Existing works mainly focus on offline or outdated data items for leaf disease
    detection. This is taken as a serious problem, which is the scope of the proposed
    work, that aims to provide real-time IoT data analysis. The other contribution
    of this work is to develop ML- and DL-based multiclassification models for detecting
    the real-time IoT (sensors) inputs gathered from various leaves. In addition,
    this work mainly concentrates on the efficient application of ensemble nonlinear
    SVM (ENSVM), K -nearest, and CNN in leaf disease detection. The comparative experimental
    analysis helps to analyze the leaf patterns and disease particles from different
    perspectives. The overall article is organized as follows. Section II gives the
    literature review, Section III provides the proposed work, Section IV provides
    the results, and finally, Section V ends with the conclusion. SECTION II. Literature
    Review The agriculture field requires more attention to be developed with intelligent
    monitoring and decision-making systems. Different types of research were carried
    out to identify various crop diseases. Rao and Sridhar [1] used several strategies
    to precise the captured indications in the cotton leaves. The images used in this
    work were maintained at nominal resolutions. These images were preprocessed and
    located in a separate image database. The conventional edge detection and classification
    techniques were used by the authors to identify the cotton leaf diseases. In addition
    to that, K -nearest classification was used to extract the color features of different
    leaves and SVM was applied to identify the diseases in plant leaves efficiently.
    Sreekantha and Kavya [2] projected a disease monitoring system for cotton plant
    diseases. The diseases were recognized by them using the images, that reflect
    the disease spot marks on the cotton leaves. The authors processed the images
    under commercial mobile cameras in an uncontrolled situation of the farmland.
    This type of image processing makes the leaf segmentation critical. This work
    used two different types of sequenced classifiers. At the first stage, the classifier
    isolates the leaf from the image background using local image features. After
    that, the classifier spots out the diseases using the hue and luminance of the
    image. This kind of research signs is good to apply ML techniques for the disease
    monitoring system in IoT-based farming fields. On this research path, Marjani
    [4] delivered a grayscale morphology-based leaf nerve extraction system. To extract
    the leaf features, the color images of the leaves were converted into grayscale
    images based on the intensity and hue contents of the image. Then, grayscale morphology
    technique was taken to remove a color confusing section of the image. The next
    step is used to identify the grayscale variations for the leaf part and nerve
    part. In the end, an optimal threshold value is determined to isolate the nerve
    part of the leaf from others. These works were mainly used to recognize the leaf
    features which are helpful to identify the disease portions at different points
    of any leaf. Further, Rajeswari et al. [5] identified the applications of X-ray
    image processing to spot the plant diseases. In this work, the leaf’s 2-D images
    were used for extracting the geometrical features and digital morphological features.
    The goal of this research work was to familiarize the appropriate features from
    the leaf patterns for future agricultural research. Mahdavinejad et al. [6] proposed
    the ANN-based plant-type identification system from the given leaf images. In
    addition to the image processing techniques, the authors used the properties of
    the given leaf image (leaf aspect ratio, apex attributes, deviation ratio, and
    leaf angle). These leaf properties were given to ANN as a set of input. The authors
    collected around 550 leaf patterns for various plants. According to that, they
    trained more than 400 leaves and acquired 93% accuracy in the plant identification.
    Srinivasalu et al. [13] used SVM for recognizing the cotton plant diseases, such
    as bacterial infections, Cercospora, and Alternaria. This work was extended in
    which, the results produced by SVM were given to the Android platform for better
    projection. This system makes the IoT platform work with ML techniques. There
    are many research works which have made their contributions in the field of the
    crop monitoring system. The proposed ECPRC concentrates on the sugar beets diseases,
    which is common in India. In this work, ENSVM (vital) is applied for the classification
    of the diseases. The conventional SVM has basic classification rules which are
    not effectively adaptable for multiple disease classification. However, ENSVM
    has multiple subclassifiers compared to the other techniques. ML is a technology
    used to train the computer system for making decisions based on the learning techniques.
    ML techniques are generally used to give learning capability to the computer systems.
    This is called the skill to learn. There are various ML techniques available.
    They are: supervised learning; unsupervised learning; clustering and classification;
    data preprocessing; dimensionality reduction; multilayer perceptron; nonparametric
    methods; hidden Markov model. Among these techniques, this proposed work uses
    an SVM with ensemble nonlinear classification. Unlike SVM (linear), ensemble nonlinear
    classification uses multilayer classifiers, which support uncertain conditions
    of leaf pattern detections. This helps to project more efficient classified results
    on disease detection. Similarly, CNN is applied for detecting leaf diseases. CNN
    is a type of multilayer perceptron model. Mainly, it is applied with many layers
    of filters. The filter types may be implemented as 5×5,4×4,3×3,… CNN does convolution
    at the beginning of filter sections to split the image patterns. Finally, it does
    deconvolution for getting the integrated results. The multilayer perceptron is
    referred to the fully connected neural networks. This means each neuron of a particular
    layer is connected to all neurons in the succeeding layer. However, CNNs take
    the benefits of the hierarchical pattern in the leaf data and create more complex
    leaf patterns for generating meaningful complex data. This gives more accurate
    results in disease detection. Finally, this proposed work uses the K -means clustering
    technique for finding the classes of various disease patterns in a leaf. K -means
    clustering is a technique, which uses the vector quantization approach. This is
    mainly derived from the signal processing technique. The technique is developed
    from the steps of cluster analysis in the data mining domain. The K -means clustering
    technique was developed of the classification partitions with n number of continuous
    observations into k time of cluster units. Each observation gathered at different
    time intervals belongs to any one of the clusters. The clustered observations
    maintain the mean value. This is nonpolynomial (NP) hard in the computational
    aspect. This has a direct conceptual relationship with the K -nearest neighbor
    classification. The proposed system uses this technique for leaf disease classification.
    SECTION III. Proposed Approach In this proposed system, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and light sensors are used to measure the temperature value,
    moisture level, and light intensity level of the plants, respectively. The data
    gathered from these sensors are manipulated by the Arduino UNO microprocessor
    unit. Fig. 1 provides the overall system architecture for the process of disease
    detection. Fig. 1. Basic system architecture. Show All Then, the values are used
    by ENSVM and CNN to identify the plant disease. To achieve this disease analysis,
    ENSVM- and CNN-based algorithms are used to make a training sample of leaf images
    and optimal threshold values for the leaf features. There are three modules in
    this proposed system. They are: hardware module; analysis module; decision-making
    module. The hardware module contains the Arduino controller unit, sensors, and
    cameras, and the analysis module maintains ML techniques activation. This module
    covered training and testing information about the leaves and leaf patterns. In
    the sensing module, the following sensors are used in the farming field. They
    are used to monitor each and every point in the plant. In addition to that, multiple
    sensors are deployed to measure environmental conditions. These components are
    connected via relays to the respective terminal devices, such as water motor and
    other computer systems. The design of the IoT architecture depends upon the components
    required to achieve the goal. Ray [10] analyzed different types of IoT architectures
    in detail. The components involved in the IoT system include any communicating
    device, terminal device, wireless sensor nodes, and networks. Ojha et al. [11]
    discussed the adaptation of the wireless sensor network in the IoT design. The
    represented components can communicate with the mobile phones to give the manipulated
    results regarding the disease classification, sensed environmental objects, and
    farmer suggestions. This kind of farming suggestion is given by the ML algorithms,
    SVM and CNN. Apart from these techniques, the component selection process is inevitable.
    Table I illustrates the details of the components used in this proposed work.
    Fig. 2 gives the specific pattern from the general structure in Fig. 1 to identify
    the plant disease. TABLE I IoT Components Fig. 2. ECPRC modules description. Show
    All A. ENSVM-Based Disease Identification SVM is an ML technique which is used
    to analyze and classify the given problem in a supervised manner. The supervised
    classification using SVM uses different classes of disease patterns and leaf patterns
    to classify the observed plant diseases. This proposed ECPRC uses ENSVM. The ENSVM
    manages the data classification by dividing the classifiers into several subfunctions
    to spot out the disease variations. This is the advantage of detecting various
    leaf diseases. Zhang et al. [16] used ensemble SVM (ENSVM) for pattern identification
    for cognitive tasks identification. As same as, this proposed system as discussed
    in Algorithm 1, uses ENSVM for leaf disease pattern identification. The ENSVM
    classifies the input image patterns into several classes, c and subclasses, with
    n samples and k patterns c∈{−n,+n} with respect to c=sign(f(k)). (1) View Source
    f(k) is a nonlinear grouping of kernels m ( ki , k ) calculating the resemblances

    classifiers in the ECPRC framework. In this figure, sensors and relays are shown
    in the hardware part. The ECPRC engine helps to activate either ENSVM or CNN activities
    once the data are received from the sensors. In addition, the overall units are
    controlled by the Arduino UNO module. The processed data can be stored anywhere
    as in cloud storage, local storage area, or remote database. This data is accessible
    from any place when it is hosted in the Internet domain. Preferably, they can
    be stored in portable cloud storage for providing security, accessibility, availability,
    and easy handling tasks. The ENSVM classifier handles the given testing data using
    the training data set. The training data set contains around 600 leaf patterns
    and 35 disease patterns. Fig. 3. ECPRC process for crop disease monitoring. Show
    All The disease patterns may belong to several disease classes. The ENSVM is also
    used to identify the nutrients in each leaf. However, this can be analyzed by
    CNN when compared to ENSVM. Apart from disease identification, ENSVM helps to
    give accurate chlorophyll, potassium, and nitrogen levels in plants. As same as,
    Lee et al. [12] used various types of prediction systems for big data systems.
    B. CNN-Based Disease Detection CNN has three different layers, such as the input
    layer, the output layer, and the hidden layer as same all the neural networks
    as depicted in Fig 4. CNN holds multiple stages of functions as follows: input
    phase; convolution phase; detector phase; pooling phase; normalization phase;
    output phase. Fig. 4. CNN structure. Show All CNN reduces the neural connections
    and complexity of the network functions to increase performance execution. Algorithm
    2 describes CNN-based crop disease detection. Dahikar and Rode [14] used CNN for
    predicting and recognizing the crop yield in the agricultural lands. This motivates
    the proposed system to use CNN for disease prediction in the leaves. Compared
    to SVM and ENSVM, CNN uses trained neuron functions and layers of filters for
    isolating different disease sectors with high-quality rate. The following algorithm
    is proposed using CNN which detects the diseases based on filtering applied over
    spectral features of the leaf images. This works better than ENSVM’s subclassifiers.

    Disease Detections Step 1: Input image Im (raw image) has 32X32X3 size with RGB
    band (spectral bands) Step 2: Each image segments are weighted by convolutional
    layer function and form the neurons Step 3: Image filters are applied (15 Filters)
    Step 4: Relu activation function is applied on leaf elements with respect to a
    computed threshold value. Step 5: The down sampling operations have been activated
    using the pooling procedure using spatial details, SP 1 ,…,  SP m . Step 6: Compute
    classes and scores for different leaves and create CIFAR-10 set. Step 7: Create
    score-based disease symptoms in each leaf. Step 8: Redo the operations The main
    aim is to utilize the metaclassifier activities of ENSVM and CNN for detecting
    multiple leaf diseases. The motivation of this work lies in the usage of ML-based
    trained classifiers units of both ENSVM and CNN (DL) on dot spots identifications.
    These classifiers help to categorize multiple dot spots under multiple classes,
    which is an efficient way of detecting the disease classification. The main advantage
    of using ENSVM is providing subclassifiers for various element properties. But
    this is limited in ML aspects. In advance, CNN is used with multifiltering components
    (DL). The image segmentation, edge detection, and denoising processes of the crop
    disease detection system are implemented using the MATLAB tool. The Android studio
    is used to develop an application in mobile phone for successful monitoring of
    diseases and decision-making processes. In addition to these tools, the microprocessor
    uses an inbuilt operating system that governs the data gathered from different
    sensors. In CNN, m×m neural network layers are followed by a convolutional layer.
    For filter Fs, with f×f , dimension, the output of the convolutional layer is,
    (m−f+1)×(m−f+1) . Here, the prenonlinearity is denoted as p ℓ jk . The weighted
    filter components are computed for preceding neural layers as pℓjk= ∑ s=0 m ⋅
    ∑ l=0 m ( n k )Fsl x k−1 (j+s)(k+l) n−k . (6) View Source Then, CNN uses a nonlinear
    function x ℓ jk=σ( x ℓ jk). (7) View Source Here, σ —nonlinear function, and x
    ℓ jk —filters applied for input leaf sequences. The convolution and pooling phases
    are designed using 256 filters maximum as given in Table II. Further, Table II
    illustrates the details of the neural layers, filter sizes, and channels used
    to reconstruct the spectral images of the leaves at high-intensity levels. TABLE
    II CNN Phases SECTION IV. Results The input image of a leaf is given with RGB
    spectral information. The high-spectral image taken by HySpexHD camera is converted
    into its equivalent grayscale image. 75% of the data from the data set are used
    for training purposes and the remaining 25% are used for testing purposes. Fig.
    5(a) illustrates an RGB spectral image of the leaves and Fig. 5(b) depicts a grayscale
    image of the leaves. In the grayscale image, the dots in leaves are spotted clearly
    than the basic spectral view. Fig. 6(a) shows the noise coefficients of a given
    image, which gives unwanted depiction in an image. This phase helps to identify
    the leaves alone in the image. Further, these noise coefficients are used for
    denoising the image. Fig. 5. Input image patterns. (a) Given RGB image. (b) Grayscale
    image. Show All Fig. 6. Image recreation. (a) Noise coefficients. (b) Filtered
    output. Show All In addition, Fig. 6(b) gives another outcome, which filtered
    the leaf images. This filters the noise data. By comparing the training sets of
    these kinds of leaves, ENSVM and CNN identify the disease type. Fig. 7(a) provides
    a binary image to identify the exact leaves portion in the image. Then, the color
    enhancement helps to improve the contrast of the image to increase the visual
    interpretation of the image [Fig. 7(b)]. The Arduino UNO controller and the sensor
    units are illustrated with the display modules. Fig. 8 gives the reading of the
    temperature sensor (Celsius) and the humidity sensor (%) units with respect to
    the different croplands. The readings of the sensor vary from field to field.
    This kind of assistantship helps to clarify the environmental issues of the crop
    disease monitoring system. Fig. 7. Image enhancement. (a) Binary image. (b) Color-enhanced
    image. Show All Fig. 8. Sample sensor readings. Show All Be sure that the symbols
    in your equation have been defined. Fig. 8 represents the level of temperature
    and humidity in different agriculture fields. The temperature and the humidity
    of the field are linear to each other. Fig. 9 illustrates the defects in plant
    leaves (dark shades and dot spots). Fig. 9. Defects identification. Show All True
    positive and false negative are accurate decisions. This means true positive refers
    to the detection of disease and false-negative states the successful detection
    of a disease-less leaf. In contrast, true negative illustrates the disease where
    the leaf has no disease. As same as, false-positive gives a false alarm for disease
    detection. The variations of CNN and ENSVM with respect to their accuracy and
    recall rate, respectively. This shows that CNN gives better results than ENSVM.
    The K -nearest gives a moderate classification rate compared to the other two
    proposed techniques. In this manner, Table III provides a comparison between CNN,
    ENSVM, and K -nearest classification techniques. The techniques, such as Naïve
    Bayes, K -nearest, and other conventional approaches, are compared to the CNN
    and ENSVM, where the later approaches use multiple subclassification layers and
    spectral features-based filters. Moreover, these techniques are not more complex
    to create overhead in tiny IoT devices. It is very important to detect diseases
    from leaves using high-level spectral features and more subclassifiers than more
    complexity. TABLE III Quality Measurements The results are compared with the existing
    techniques [16] to evaluate the proposed system performance. The existing system
    uses ENSVM and Gaussian models for pattern identification with the task evaluation.
    In their models, they used a limited set of patterns and applied ML techniques
    only. But the proposed system deals with both ML and DL techniques. In addition,
    most of the techniques consider offline data sets. But the proposed system takes
    the real-time sensor data to gain real efficiency. Fig. 10 represents the connections
    of the agriculture monitoring system, temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor,
    and light intensity sensor. They are connected and the signals are amplified and
    sent for manipulating to the Arduino controller unit. LCD is used to display the
    values from the sensors. GSM is used to send the alert message to the farmer.
    Fig. 10. Connection of monitoring system. Show All Fig. 11 provides the various
    quality measurements in terms of recall, sensitivity, specificity, and precision
    for various techniques. Figs. 12 and 13 describe the performance and the comparative
    analysis of various ML techniques and ENSVM technique. Fig. 12 illustrates the
    absolute error rate in leaf pattern recognition. Fig. 13 depicts the computation
    overhead created by each ML and DL technique. In this comparison, CNN and ENSVM
    perform notably. Particularly, ENSVM effectively detects the leaf patterns. At
    the same time, CNN detects the leaf patterns and disease spots with minimal errors.
    The reason is that CNN is mainly implemented for image pattern recognition purposes.
    Fig. 11. Quality measurements. Show All Fig. 12. Error rate. Show All Fig. 13.
    Computation overhead. Show All Fig. 13 reveals the computation overhead of all
    the techniques. In this comparison, CNN produces little more overhead than ENSVM
    and other techniques. As CNN is a DL network, it has more complex filter functions
    than other systems. But the need for efficiency is important in disease identification.
    Thus, the overhead can be ignored. Other techniques, such as K -nearest, SVM,
    Bayesian network, and Naïve Bayes, produce limited overhead. However, they lack
    in accuracy rate. The evaluation process is experimented for increasing the number
    of leaf samples. SECTION V. Conclusion The ECPRC system was implemented to provide
    both environmental observance-based crop disease monitoring system. In this work,
    IoT infrastructures were deployed to monitor and capture the leaf images in hyperspectral
    modes. The hyperspectral images of the leaves were processed to track the disease
    points. These images were stored in cloud storage systems to be handled by ENSVM
    and CNN. CNN and ENSVM were used to train the IoT infrastructures to detect the
    various types of leaf diseases. In addition, the other ML techniques, such as
    K -nearest, Bayesian, Naïve Bayes, and conventional SVM techniques, were compared
    with each other for ensuring the real-time application of the intelligent crop
    disease monitoring system. In the future, this work is to be extended using a
    huge data set of multiple plants and its parts using the deep learning approaches.

    I. Introduction Advances in sensor and communication technologies have revolutionized
    home living, introducing unprecedented comfort and personalization options for
    users. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart devices has
    given rise to a new industry of consumer electronics, catering specifically to
    Smart Home-Internet of Things (SH-IoT) environments. TVs, vacuums, temperature
    controls, and irrigation systems when coupled with the internet have all transformed
    how people interact with and manage their homes. To facilitate communication among
    the increasing number of smart devices in homes, various communication protocols
    have been adopted. The Internet Protocol (IP) is still the most widely used, but
    its power consumption limits its application in battery-powered devices for SH-IoT.
    As a result, other protocols like Zigbee, Z-wave, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    have been developed, each forming its own network for communication. However,
    this diversification raised the need for security features in smart homes devices
    such as encryption and authentication to safeguard against breaches and to prevent
    unauthorized access. Given the growing interest in smart home IoT,this survey
    discusses advances in SH-IoT protocols, their security features, and developments
    in new interoperability standards. SECTION II. Smart Home-IoT Architecture A.
    IoT Elements in Smart Homes Smart home IoT relies on smart devices and applications,
    offering a wide range of functionalities. These devices include sensors for monitoring
    mail delivery, tracking solar energy consumption/generation, and controlling various
    aspects like temperature, lighting, garage doors, appliances, entertainment, and
    home security. The application platform gathers data from home devices through
    sensors and uses software to create a personalized user experience [1]. Fig. 1.
    Smart Home IoT Architecture Show All B. Layers in Smart Home-IoT Architecture
    SH-IoT architecture is structured into three layers in a top-down approach: Cloud
    Layer: Servers and cloud-based infrastructure Fog Layer or Gateway Layer: Network
    gateway devices like routers that serve as intermediaries between cloud and edge
    devices. Edge Layer: Consists of devices such as smartphones and tablets and sensored
    devices like thermostats and lights. C. Sh-IoT Communication Network Structures
    In this section, we will briefly discuss communication network structures related
    to smart home environments: (1) Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network configuration
    used to communicate data between large distances (used in smart home neighborhoods).
    The internet is a WAN setup as it interconnects different computers for sending
    and receiving data packets. (2) Local Area Network (LAN) as the name entails is
    a network confined to a smaller area such as a home (home area network) or business.
    LAN tends to have a higher transmission rate than WAN but within shorter distances,
    its similar to WAN, and typically has one device (modem/router) acting as a door
    in communicating to the internet. (3) Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) is
    a network that is typically used with short-range communication protocols such
    as Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-wave, Thread, BLE, and as of Fall 2022, Matter. WPAN has
    a low data rate, making it slower than LAN, but the topology is more versatile
    and can be configured to be a star or mesh structure. SECTION III. Smart Home
    IoT Communication Protocols-Operation and Security In this section, we will discuss
    widely used SH-IoT protocols, their advanced security features, and configurations.
    SH-IoT communications protocols and their security mechanisms are listed in Fig
    2. A. Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol found in most smart
    devices, operating within the IEEE 802.15 for WPAN standards. It creates a Wireless
    Personal Area Network, allowing Bluetooth-enabled devices to connect and share
    data, such as audio and images. Bluetooth operates in the 2.4GHz to 2.48GHz unlicensed
    band and supports Piconet (star), or Scatternet (mesh) topologies, with one master
    and up to seven slaves. It has a data rate of 1Mbps or 3Mbps depending on the
    version of Bluetooth. Bluetooth is vulnerable to various attacks, including eavesdropping,
    man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), and message modification. To
    address security concerns, different security modes are defined, ranging from
    no security required to authenticate link keys and encryption algorithms for data
    integrity [2]. The modes for Bluetooth Security are defined here [2]: Mode 1:Devices
    are never considered to be secure in any implementation. Mode 2:Security procedures
    occur during the setup of the Service Layer, i.e., security is in effect after
    a link is established but not before logical channel is established. The concept
    of device authorization is introduced in this mode. Mode 3:Security procedures
    occur during the setup of the Link Layer before the physical link is fully established.
    This mode of operation makes authentication and encryption a hard requirement
    for all connections established between devices. This mode makes it impossible
    for service discovery to take place until authentication, encryption, and authorization
    have been completed. Mode 4:Security procedures occur during the setup of the
    Service Layer, similar to mode 2. However, mode 4 implements Secure Simple Pairing(SSP),
    in which Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [3] [4] key agreement is utilized
    for link key generation. The P-192 Elliptic Curve was used for the link key generation
    until Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth 4.1 introduced the Secure Connections feature,
    which now implements P-256 Elliptic Curve for link key generation, and upgraded
    the authentication algorithm to FIPS-approved 256-bit Hash Message Authentication
    Code Secure Hash Algorithm [5] (HMAC-SHA-256). The encryption algorithm was also
    upgraded in 4.1 to FIPS-approved AES-Counter with CBC-MAC (AES-CCM) to ensure
    data integrity [2]. B. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)/Bluetooth Smart BLE was introduced
    in Bluetooth 4.0 and updated in 4.1 and 4.2 versions, specifically for devices
    with low computation power requirements [2]. BLE was initially created to be able
    to implement a Bluetooth stack in coin cell battery-powered devices, by periodically
    engaging in data transmission. It usually is in sleep mode, i.e., BLE remains
    in sleep mode unless a connection initiates, significantly reducing power consumed.
    One difference between Bluetooth and BLE is key generation. BLE generates a Long-Term
    Key (LTK), which is fundamentally similar to the Link Key. In BLE legacy pairing
    the LTK is generated by one of the devices, which then sends it to the other device
    during the pairing. BLE also was upgraded in Bluetooth 4.1 and the same security
    algorithms apply [2]. BLE is unencrypted by default, it is important to select
    a security mode. C. Zigbee (Now the Connectivity Standard Alliance) Designed as
    a low data rate wireless personal area protocol, Zigbee has found its application
    in smart home IoT environments. The low data rate feature makes it useful for
    controlling home lighting, smart switches/dimmers and occupancy sensors to name
    a few applications; its mesh topology makes it very useful as a Personal Area
    Network (PAN). Zigbee has two bands on which it operates, on 868/915MHz providing
    a data rate of around 20-40Kbps, and 2450MHz providing a data rate of around 250Kbps.
    Zigbee protocol stack consists of four layers; the application layer, the network
    layer, the MAC layer, and the physical layer. The security in Zigbee is implemented
    in the network layer when enabled. If it is enabled then AES 128-bit symmetric
    keys [6] are used, the keys can either be preinstalled or obtained after the joining
    process [7]. A Zigbee node can support over 240 end points, each end point specifies
    a specific application. The topology of Zigbee consists of the Coordinator, Router,
    and End Devices. The controller/coordinator is always the first device that is
    setup when configuring a Zigbee network. The controller picks the channel and
    PAN ID i.e., the device is responsible for establishing the PAN. Once the PAN
    is established other Zigbee devices may join its network such as router and End
    devices. The controller is always powered by the main line in a home (i.e., outlet),
    and it never goes into sleep mode. The controller can act as a router if needed
    to help in routing data through the network, and can trigger the acceptance of
    other routers [7]. End devices have limited authority in the network, they cannot
    give authorization to devices to join the network or assist in data routing. End
    devices are battery-powered, and are put to sleep periodically to help in power
    consumption [7]. D. Z-Wave Z-wave is a low-bandwidth communication protocol commonly
    used in smart home IoT applications like security sensors and alarms. It operates
    in the ISM band, with specific frequencies for the USA (908.42MHz) and Europe
    (868.42MHz). The protocol uses a master-slave mesh network topology, comprising
    controllers (primary and secondary) and slaves. Controllers initiate commands
    to the slave nodes, with the primary controller hosting the routing table and
    controlling node additions and removals. Slaves execute or relay commands as instructed
    by the controller. Z-Wave ensures network encapsulation using a 32-bit identifier
    Home ID for each controller. To enhance security, Z-wave implements the S2 framework
    based on Elliptic Curve [4] Diffie-Hellman [3] cryptography, providing resistance
    to attacks. It also incorporates AES 128-bit [6] symmetric cryptography for additional
    protection. Previous vulnerabilities related to a hard-coded default key have
    been addressed through firmware updates in the S2 framework [8]. Fig. 2. SH-IoT
    Protocols and Security Features Show All E. Thread Thread standard is low powered,
    low latency wireless mesh network protocol based on IPv6 over low-power wireless
    area networks (6LoWPAN). It is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low rate
    WPAN (LoWPAN). Thread comprises of a Physical layer and MAC layer that operate
    with 250kbps data rate in 2.4GHz band for link layer communication [9]. IEEE 802.15.4
    standard''s Carrier Sense Multiple AccessCollision Avoidance (CSMA-CA) is the
    basis for Thread''s reliable transmission. CSMA-CA allows multiple devices to
    share 2.4GHz band, and initiates transmission only after confirming the channel
    is empty. Thread was designed to be a battery supply friendly protocol, even though
    it uses IPv6 it compresses the packet headers to minimize the size of the transmitted
    packet [9]. Thread network comprises of full thread devices and minimal thread
    devices. Full thread devices set constitutes of a Router that manages the routing
    needs of the network, a Leader that can make decisions as well as act as router,
    Router-Eligible End Devices (REED) that are non routing devices with capabilities
    to act as router when called by leader, and Full End Devices (FED) which are full
    thread devices that cannot be promoted to routers but can act as border routers.
    Thread network is dynamic in nature, if the Leader is knocked offline for some
    reason, network will select a different router to be the Leader creating zeros
    point of failures in the network. Full thread devices that can be border routers,
    act as hub and create IPv6 subnets of the thread network (since devices are IP-addressable),
    essentially becoming gateways [9]. Minimal thread devices set constitutes of Minimal
    End Devices (MED) which cannot forward messages but only can communicate with
    parent router, Sleepy End Devices (SED) are similar to MEDs whose radios are turned
    off and periodically wakes up to check for communication with parent router, and
    Synchronized Sleepy End Devices (SSED) are similar to SEDs whose radios are turned
    off and wake up at scheduled intervals to check for communication with parent
    router. Thread implements AES-CCM [10] based network-wide key for payload encryption,
    in which the cipher works by implementing a check tag, appends some data to individual
    messages that can later be verified against the network-wide key, to verify if
    a message originated from where it says it did and to ensure that message integrity
    has not been violated. A new device joining thread network is oblivious to what
    the network key is. Since key cannot be sent over in an unsecured manner due to
    risks in compromise, Thread uses Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) method
    to send key in a secure manner [9]. F. Matter/Project Chip (Connected Home Over
    IP) Matter is the newest standard released in October 2022, created by the Zigbee
    alliance now called Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) which includes companies
    like Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, Comcast and many other silicon valley manufacturers,
    to achieve “interoperability” between devices in smart home IoT environment. Matter
    is similar to the interoperability standard DNP3 developed for smart grid environment
    [11]. Matter is built on the internet protocol that enables communication with
    Thread, Ethernet, and WiFi devices in a network. Matter standard was designed
    with robust security as a top priority and to provide capabilities to detect and
    recover from attacks. Matter supports a comprehensive approach with authentication
    and attestation for commissioning, message integrity, and secure over the air
    firmware updates. It implements AES in CCM mode [10] with 128 bit keys for integrity
    and confidentiality, AES in CTR mode is used for protecting identifiers to preserve
    privacy, and SHA-256 [5] for integrity. It uses ECC for enabling interoperability,
    along with use for digital signatures, key exchanges, standard key derivation,
    and true random number generation [11]. Matter development has attracted over

  description: A lack of real-time soil or plant status feedback and decision support
    systems has been a major stumbling block to the practical use of precision or
    site-specific irrigation and chemigation technologies. Data are needed on both
    a spatial and a temporal scale. It was hypothesized that an array of infrared
    thermometers, mounted on a center pivot, could provide this missing spatial and
    temporal feedback as they move over the entire field at regular intervals throughout
    the season. This was tested in a field of soybeans with varying degrees of induced
    water stresses in 2004 and 2005. Infrared thermometers were used to create canopy
    temperature maps of the underlying field every time the pivot moved over the field.
    These maps were standardized and combined into a single map for each year using
    an algorithm modeled after that used to combine multiple years of yield maps.
    These end-of-year maps for each year clearly showed stressed areas of the field.
    The combined, averaged, and standardized temperatures from the end-of-year maps
    were correlated with the end-of-year yield, biomass, and total water use in the
    different stressed plots for both years, resulting in r 2 values close to 0.8.
    These average, standardized temperatures were also significantly different across
    irrigation treatments in 2004. This demonstrates the method's ability to show
    spatial stress patterns in a field. To capture temporal variation and to highlight
    when temperature differences were caused by more than natural variation, statistical
    process control (SPC) charts were used to evaluate each point on the standardized
    temperature maps over time. Stress was deliberately introduced to a particular
    area of the field late in the 2005 season, and although the stress was not visible
    to the eye, this stressed area was clearly apparent in the SPC charts. These data
    demonstrate the ability of an array of infrared thermometers mounted on a center
    pivot to provide producers with feedback on both the spatial and temporal variability
    of a field during a growing season.

  description: Yield prediction is the primary process of predicting the plant’s growth.
    It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil
    mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture
    of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable
    environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition

    PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture is the fundamental need for every human race that
    fulfills our basic requirements. It is the country’s economy setter that provides
    occupation for the farmers and workers. Every year, the population has increased
    in every country, which in turn increases the food demands. However, crop yields
    and production growth are not going par with the food demands for several factors.
    The increase in the population encourages deforestation for urbanization and city
    establishment due to land settlement. Deforestation is the primary cause of climate
    change, including human activities such as the emission of industrial gases, excessive
    carbon-oxide emission, dumping chemical wastes, etc. It, in turn, causes contamination
    to water and the air. It also increases the concentration of greenhouse gases
    and aerosols. These activities have a substantial negative impact on the vegetation
    and farming that hinders the growth of the yields and productivity. Because of
    these consequences, plants suffer from different stresses like heat stress, drought
    stress, mineral stress, chill stress, etc. Farmers are facing a massive problem
    in yielding enough crops for supplying human demands because of the environmental-driven
    stresses on the plants. Because of these problems, crop productivity is not getting
    improved over the years, instead, it is getting deteriorating gradually. Moreover,
    the environment has been consistently changing, and it could be worse in the future
    due to the continuous increase in greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Due to the inevitable
    climate change, it is crucial to sustain the increasing agricultural demands for
    the survival of the human race. Apparently, the laborious form of farming will
    no longer support the growing agricultural demands in the near future as it requires
    effort and is time-consuming. Moreover, due to the inconsistency of human force,
    it could drastically reduce the accuracy of the farming management system. Because
    of these challenges, it is crucial to introduce the technologies in the agricultural
    domain to elevate the farming management systems and sustain the increasing food
    demands despite climate change. The IoT technology is an emerging technology that
    has set foot on several domains and applications, including the agricultural domain.
    With the advancement of IoT technology, farmers can monitor and control all kinds
    of parameters remotely on the field in real-time. It allows the farmers to evaluate
    and predict the growth of the crop, which will significantly aid in the increase
    of crop productivity. Moreover, the IoT technology promotes interconnectivity
    and interoperability, allowing farmers from different places across the globe
    to share farming experiences to improve farming management systems. Along with
    the emergence of IoT technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also paved its
    path in this technological era. AI technology has practically transform manual
    systems into automated systems in which human intervention is dramatically reduced.
    There is a huge scope in incorporating the IoT and AI technologies, especially
    in the agricultural domain, for transforming traditional farming into automated
    farming to promote precision agriculture. 2 Literature Survey The estimation of
    crop yields before the harvest is challenging due to the continuous change in
    the climatic regime. Nowadays, the season has slightly shifted its pattern, making
    it difficult for farmers and agronomists to predict the upcoming agricultural
    yield. Since weather influences the plants’ growth, the farmers need to be resilient
    with the help of technologies to improve the quality of farming. Technological
    advancement helps solve current problems, such as weather prediction, water content
    monitoring, disease prediction, and precision irrigation systems. Machine learning
    is widely used in various application areas for solving nonlinear problems. It
    also would be an excellent tool for predicting crop yields, which would highly
    aid in farming. Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines are the algorithms
    commonly used in prediction and classification [2]. One of the primary concerns
    in agricultural farming is water scarcity. The continuous use of fertilizers has
    a significant impact on groundwater contamination, which affects the growth of
    crops and could be hazardous for human consumption. Water has been extensively
    wasted in farming, whopping 60% of the water used in agriculture into waterways
    and over-watering the crops. Water can be preserved by supplying an adequate amount
    of water at the right time and avoiding evapotranspiration. The advancement in
    technology, IoT sensors, and AI technology can monitor the water content, pH level,
    mineral content, and atmospheric temperature. These technologies provide better
    control for the farmers in watering the crops, predicting the weather, and giving
    adequate minerals for healthy plants’ growth [3]. The systematic irrigation system
    aids in watering plants with an optimum water content which provides crops and
    fibers a desirable condition for their proper growth. Global warming has affected
    the regime of precipitation and water sources. Since water is the vital source
    of growth in crops, it is essential to preserve water and utilize them smartly
    to promote a precision irrigation system. Pests and diseases also have significant
    impacts on crop yield. Early detection of water deficiency, stress, and invasion
    of pests could probably prevent the crops from being lesioned or deteriorating
    growth. An IoT system helps optimize the amount of water used and sends information
    to the edge node to process the data locally when the internet connection is limited
    [4]. The artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi regression model are the
    models to evaluate and estimate the seed yield of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)
    using field data. The data includes the flowering time, the height of the plant,
    the capsule number per plant, the weight of the plant, and the number of seeds
    per capsule. It shows that artificial neural network performs much accurately
    in predicting the sources yield of sesame than the multi regression model [5].
    An experiment was conducted in Shahrood, Semnan province, Iran, to predict pepper
    fruit yields. An artificial neural network has been implemented to monitor the
    pepper fruit yield response by considering different parameters such as the growth
    of the pepper fruit seeds from initial stages to the harvest stage, the height
    of the plant, canopy width, number of fruit bears per plant, fruit water content,
    and reproduction stage duration. It has achieved 97% accuracy in predicting the
    growth of the seeds [6]. 3 Environment Impact on Agriculture Agriculture depends
    on the environmental condition associated with the biological cycle inside the
    ecosystem, just as any other living organism. According to the seasons, farmers
    and agronomists plan their farming and yielding strategies for the whole year.
    Biologically, every plant species have their traits and growing pattern in different
    seasons. Due to the significant variances in their characteristics, sustaining
    the food products for the whole year is challenging for the farmers. However,
    this farming system has also been threatened by the rapid growth of urbanization
    across the globe. Although the urban land provides development and sophistication
    to the human lifestyle, there are several adverse effects on Biodiversity. Urbanization
    is a primary cause of native species extinction, such as birds, wild animals,
    etc. Moreover, it is associated with deforestation, which reduces the tremendous
    amount of trees every year for the urban land. This human activity has led to
    an imbalance of the biological life cycle. The overwhelming growth of the population
    is changing the earth system’s biogeochemical cycles, pushing the nutrients and
    compounds out of balance with the usual climatic and biological feedback mechanisms.
    These imbalances contribute to ocean acidification, climate change, marine dead
    zones, and many other environmental problems. Urbanization is likely to widen
    its path even more to procure a sufficient amount of urban land for the people.
    Since the food demand has been increasing daily, the farmers and agronomists insist
    on using fertilizers and pesticides, which is the chemical composition to enhance
    soil fertility and significantly increase yield production to meet the increasing
    demands [7]. This process of sustaining yield production is not ideal since it
    possibly degrades soil fertility and affects the consumers because of the chemical
    components. Some of the environmental impact on agriculture are: Water pollution—Water
    is one of the vital sources of life for all living organisms. Water quality has
    been degraded gradually because of many factors such as urbanization, pollution,
    sanitation, and chemical outlets [8]. Dumping wastes and chemicals by industries,
    hospitals, water treatment systems, construction, laboratories, and poor sanitation
    systems leads to empoisoning the water on the river and any other water sources
    that can harm animals, people, and plants. The practice of using fertilizers and
    pesticides in agricultural fields is also a major pollutant of water sources.
    The chemicals in these fertilizers could be hazardous for humans and cause several
    diseases. Air pollution—Urbanization has brought economic prosperity to society
    and made us stay connected with people across the globe. It promotes accessibility
    and also provides portability. However, despite the advantages, there is a trade-off
    between urbanization and environmental sustainability. One of the primary reasons
    is deforestation that leads to global warming. The cutting of trees for urban
    land created an imbalance in the ecosystem and has dramatically changed the climate
    over time which causes the greenhouse effect. Among several sectors, agriculture
    is one of the most affected by climate change. The crop yields and harvest have
    become an enormous challenge for the farmers since the climatic cycle has also
    gradually changed. The atmospheric temperature has become extreme in summer, and
    winter temperatures have reached beyond the optimum level. Because of these consequences,
    the crops are stressing by heat, chilled, and humidity stress which falls beyond
    the optimum temperature. Agriculture is highly dependent on climate and the environment.
    The anticipation of feeding 9 billion people by the year 2050 would be an enormous
    challenge. 4 Scope of AI in Agriculture The current food production is insufficient
    to supply the requirements of food demands primarily because of the increasing
    population. The traditional farming practices could be limited and cannot sustain
    the supply of increasing food demand due to a lack of efficiency and cost. Nonetheless,
    machines and technologies perform a task much faster and accurately than a human
    force. Moreover, farmers and agronomists face a huge challenge in predicting the
    season as seasonal shifts affect the timing of many life cycle events due to global
    warming. The temperature of the summer has become higher, which potentially leads
    to thermal stress in plants, and monsoon rain is comparatively irregular nowadays.
    Monsoon water is the primary source of water for crop growth. Since agriculture
    is entirely dependent on the weather and rainwater, the weather and inconsistent
    routine of the monsoon could disrupt the farming procedure, which reduces food
    production. The advancement in technology over the years gradually steps into
    the agriculture domain that improves the farming system. Nowadays, technological
    devices can monitor plant health, pests/diseases, mineral contents and deploy
    automatic watering systems. The incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and AI have drastically improved the traditional practices of farming. It increases
    efficiency, productivity and reduces human intervention. IoT is the interconnection
    of several devices across the globe. It enables electronic devices such as agricultural
    devices and sensors to connect with the farmers through smartphones or tablets
    that allow the farmer to have complete control over the dedicated agricultural
    sensors and actuators and retrieve information about several parameters from the
    farming fields. Moreover, farming can be operated automatically by the machines
    as per instruction given by the agronomist or the farmers. Some of the examples
    are traditional drip irrigation, automatic water sprinkler, disease detection,
    etc. Artificial intelligence has paved a path toward several domains over the
    years, including agriculture. Since the global population grows extensively every
    year, food security has to go on par with the growth of the population to meet
    the need for livelihood. However, it cannot maintain the quantity and quality
    of crop yields because of environmental change, an increase in demands, lack of
    management, global warming, etc. Due to these circumstances, there are losses
    in productivity each year. Moreover, it also made the plants incur several stresses
    such as heat stress, water stress, mineral stress, salt stress, chill stress,
    etc., that hinder the growth of plants. Experts have anticipated that the environmental
    problem will probably worsen because of human activities, deforestation, and globalization,
    which will have a huge negative impact on the vegetation, which threatened food
    security. AI is widely adopted in the agricultural parameters to solve problems
    and optimize the production and operation processes in agriculture, food, and
    bio-system engineering. It is designed to mimic human intelligence to work on
    an appliance capable of differentiating and classifying variables. Some of the
    applications of artificial intelligence in agricultural parameters are: Plant
    Disease Prediction—Plants are exposed and vulnerable to pests and pathogens such
    as viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. Plant pathogen has caused tremendous productivity
    loss globally every year [9]. In the olden days, farmers manually investigate
    plants individually to verify whether they got infected by any pathogens. The
    process became tedious, inaccurate, and time-consuming for a farmer to do it mechanically.
    Since the population of the plant pathogen are variable in time, space and genotype,
    it is difficult for the farmers to predict and control. Early detection of plant
    pathogen is essential to reduce the spread of disease and facilitates prior management
    practices. To improve the prediction of pathogens, DNA-based and serological methods
    had revolutionized plant disease prediction that facilitates essential apparatus
    for accurate and efficient disease prediction. However, DNA-based and serological
    techniques are not reliable for the early asymptomatic stages [10]. Over the past
    few decades, artificial intelligence helps with the automatic detection of pathogens
    in a much faster and precise manner. In theory, the systems contain datasets that
    include images of diseased and healthy images, and it is trained to classify the
    types of images. The device will then learn to classify the leaf images and be
    able to distinguish between the healthy and affected leaf images. The process
    of AI-based disease detection model can perform the operation at high speed with
    a higher accuracy rate that can detect diseases even on the asymptomatic stages.
    Livestock Monitoring—Animals are one of the sources of food provider for human
    consumption, where they provide meats, milk, eggs, etc. So, it is necessary to
    keep livestock animals healthy and maintain a hygienic environment for quality
    and healthy food production. Animals may be susceptible to diseases primarily
    because of their food habits. Early detection of animal diseases is mandatory
    to reduce the spread as they are highly contagious, and they could indirectly
    threaten human life. A farmer needs to monitor and understand the animal’s behavior,
    gesture, distress, and disease control to better nurture experience and better
    decisions [11]. However, it could be laborious for a farmer to monitor each animal
    to check whether they are in a good health state, especially in large-scale livestock.
    Fortunately, AI-based livestock monitoring can be promising in animal husbandry
    to monitor animals’ behavioral aspects individually, which helps them recognize
    facial features and hide patterns with the help of the Image processing technique.
    The AI-based monitoring system works around the clock in real-time. It better
    comprehends the multiple animals’ gestures and behavior much efficiently. Smart
    Irrigation—Water is a vital part of farming, and it is essential to make sure
    crops get enough water to have proper growth. The agriculture sector is most affected
    by water scarcity consuming a whopping 80% of the total water use [12]. So, it
    is crucial to preserve water and reuse it as much as possible to avoid water scarcity.
    The technological modernization brought devices to promote these water preservation
    models in which devices such as water sprinklers and drip irrigation systems are
    commonly used. These devices assist in saving a reasonable amount of water and
    even saves time for farmers. However, the mechanical devices require a partial
    human intervention to handle the machine, so there are challenges and room for
    improvement to transform farming to be completely automatic [13]. AI-based Smart
    Irrigation System is the way to move forward for more intelligent and efficient
    agriculture, which is environmentally friendly. Weather/Temperature Forecasting—Agriculture
    is highly dependent on the climate and the weather variability that could potentially
    influence productivity and food security [14]. Forecasting weather for several
    months ahead could help the farmer to anticipate and prepare for the process accordingly
    without wasting time and resources. The weather regime has changed its pattern
    because of several factors and no longer follows the regular trend. The weather
    pattern and atmosphere are highly nonlinear, which makes it difficult to predict
    and anticipate. AI-based prediction is known to be the most feasible solution
    to solve these types of nonlinear data problems [15]. Soil Health and Mineral
    Management—The fundamental factor for agricultural production sustainability relies
    on soil quality conservation [16]. Soil has contained several minerals that are
    nutritious and non-nutritious for the crops. Good soil management will help the
    farmers to ensure that the soil content does not incur mineral deficiency and
    contain harmful particles for the plants, which can indirectly intoxicate humans
    during consumption. Because of human activities and soil erosions, the soil has
    become contaminated and degraded, potentially harmful for human consumption. Despite
    the soil degradation, the sustenance of the productivity with nutritional products
    for our healthy diets, monitoring the soil health and mineral with sophisticated
    technologies like AI and IoT is essential to make it environmentally friendly,
    efficient, less-laborious, and cost-effective. The use of these technologies is
    the most feasible way to sustain productivity with healthy products without further
    intoxicating the soil. Plants Stress Monitoring—Climate change has a substantial
    adverse impact on the daily temperature by altering the precipitation’s intensification
    [17]. Because of these consequences, the plant tends to have several environmental
    stresses like heat stress, chill stress, salt stress, and mineral stress. Plants
    typically have severe inner damage when it develops visible symptoms due to the
    several environmental stresses [18]. Early detection of environmental stresses
    at the asymptomatic stages could save the plants from deterioration and complete
    leaf damage. The IoT and AI technology have been considered the primary viable
    solution to solve these problems and challenges. Image processing has become a
    powerful tool for monitoring and object detection, detecting plant stresses at
    a very early stage. It is a non-invasive form of technology and also environmentally
    friendly. Yield Prediction—Crop yield prediction is essential for sustaining food
    production. Depending on the prediction of the yields, it provides information
    about the feasibility of growing crops within a specified timespan. Since agriculture
    is the economy setter of the country, policymakers rely on the yield prediction
    that will highly impact the import and export of the country [19]. It also provides
    essential information for the farmers and agronomists to decide on the farming,
    harvestation, and management strategies. However, yield prediction is highly challenging
    as multiple factors and parameters are considered for the evaluation. AI technology
    is deemed to be the most powerful tool for plant stress prediction. It has been
    demonstrated in several articles [20,21,22]. Supply Chain Management—One of the
    most important things for the farmer is selling their end products. Without a
    proper middle man or a reseller, farmers could face a hard time dealing with the
    products and selling them into the market. Supply chain management involves location
    planning, purchasing, inventory management, routing/scheduling problems, and freight
    consolidation [23]. This process could be tedious and time-consuming for the farmer
    to do it manually. Artificial intelligence is powerful in evaluating the data
    and the correlation of different nodes on the supply chain. 5 Yield Prediction
    Crop yield prediction is essential for the farmers to know the reason behind the
    farming strategies and management. Prediction of yield could be a huge challenge
    as there are multiple parameters such as temperature, pesticides, rainfall, fertilizers,
    humidity, ph level, and other atmospheric conditions to predict crop yields. In
    the past, farmers observe and learn manually from their experiences during their
    farming days [24]. Apparently, they could sustain their products with their observation
    and occasions for quite a long time in the past. However, gradual climatic changes
    make it challenging to predict the timely seasonal crop yields. With the inconsistency
    and volatility of the current climatic conditions, the prediction of crop yields
    could be miserable with the traditional techniques. To mitigate these problems,
    sensor technology and artificial intelligence are rapidly emerging in the agricultural
    sector. Artificial intelligence is one of the most powerful tools for modeling
    and prediction. Datasets play a significant role in AI models. For many farmers,
    it might be challenging to adopt the technology into the agricultural land as
    it required knowledge for bridging the gap between agriculture and technology.
    So, awareness and workshops must be made mandatory for the farmers to promote
    farming practices and promote precision agriculture. Crop yield prediction comprises
    several parameters in which any one of these could not be less emphasized because
    they help to thrive the growth of the crops collectively. Some of the main parameters
    that are to emphasize for precision agriculture are: Temperature—The farmers must
    maintain the temperature of the growing environment to sustain crop growth. Because
    of the climatic regime variability, the temperature is becoming extreme, causing
    crops prone to encounter heat or chilling stress. So, controlling the temperature
    to the optimum level would sustain the growth of the plants. Minerals/Soil Health—Soil
    is the primary source of nutrients and minerals for the life of the crops. Smart
    soil management would drastically aid the farmer in ensuring healthy soil and
    non-toxicity for the plants’ growth [25]. Additionally, soil in a particular area
    might not necessarily have required minerals for the specific plants since the
    plants are variable in traits, characteristics, and morphologically different
    from one another. These parameters will allow a farmer to emphasize and treat
    particular plants according to the mineral and vitamin requirements. Humidity—There
    is a high correlation between humidity and temperature. Humidity is essential,
    just as the temperature, which impacts the growth of the plants. Some particular
    plants thrive in a specific area with higher humidity, where some plants have
    difficulties sprouting. Depending on the plants’ requirement, controlling the
    intensity of the humidity would help the farmers to grow desire particular plant
    species pretty much anywhere regardless of the suitability of the area of land.
    Water Intensity—Water is one of the vital sources of livelihood for the plants.
    The precipitation pattern is gradually changing because of climate change that
    affects water availability, which eventually causes drought in many arid and semi-arid
    areas and a lack of water sources for agriculture [26]. Sustenance of water for
    agriculture solely implies not wasting water simultaneously, supplying an adequate
    water source for the plants. Pests Control—Pests, weeds, and pathogens are the
    types of harmful organisms that have invaded crops in the field, causing significant
    losses in food production every year [27]. Early detection helps protect and prevent
    the deterioration of the plants attacked by several types of pests and diseases.
    Since it is variable in time, space, and genotype, it is a challenge for farmers
    to predict and respond whenever the invasion occurs. 6 Machine Learning-Based
    Yield Prediction Machine learning is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence inspired
    by the human intellect to solve real-world problems [28]. It is a process of training
    a system to make a decision depending on the circumstances and solve complex problems
    without human intervention. Unlike traditional programming, machine learning works
    with data from which it learns and provides relevant output. IoT and machine learning
    have been adopted in technology, science, and commerce streams such as banking,
    medical, traffic, autonomous vehicle, defense, agriculture, etc. [29]. Because
    of the vulnerability of agricultural productivity, machine learning has gradually
    emerged in the farming sector for sustainable food production. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) combines technologies, management strategies, and farming practices to solve
    agricultural problems [30]. With the help of sensor and IoT technology, wide ranges
    of data are generated from sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors, electrochemical
    sensors, soil moisture sensors, mechanical sensors, weather sensors, smart cameras,
    etc. Moreover, it also provides interoperability and the capability of controlling
    various devices remotely over the network. These sensors technologies can collect
    data from the sensors, such as soil condition and mineral content, temperature
    and humidity, visual representation, etc. Researchers are concentrating on improving
    the current farming strategies and techniques using machine learning and deep
    learning techniques. 6.1 Soil Health and Mineral Content The soil contains different
    mineral contents, pH levels, and salinity depending upon the geographical location.
    Due to this, some particular plants could grow in specific places. In order to
    make plants thrive despite the geographical location, the required minerals and
    vitamins must be provided to the plant in an adequate amount. Soil testing is
    the key to determine the soil contents and the availability of the required nutrients,
    which helps the farmer to evaluate the amount of nutrients needed for the specific
    plants. Suchithra et al. [31] presented an article in which the soil test results
    have been used to classify several significant soil features such as Phosphorus
    (P), Potassium (K), Boron (B), Organic carbon (OC), and Soil Reaction (pH). The
    classification and prediction of these minerals would help in reducing the fertilizers
    expenses, increase productivity, improve soil health, and environmental quality.
    Moreover, it will also reduce the expenditure and time for the experts to analyze
    the soil. Extreme learning machine is implemented for the classification of the
    soil parameters. Several activation functions such as sine-squared, Gaussian radial
    basis, hyperbolic tangent, triangular basis, and hard limit were tested; the Gaussian
    radial basis acquired the highest accuracy of 80%, and hyperbolic tangent attained
    the highest in the pH classification with the precision of 90%. Extreme learning
    machine is the feedforward neural network that uses Moore—Penrose generalized
    inverse instead of gradient-descent-based backpropagation. Soil salinity is one
    of the most common causes of soil degradation [32, 33]. It can degrade soil fertility
    and cause soil erosion which affects vegetation and decrease food productivity.
    Since water is attracted to salt and when the intensity of salt content is high
    in the soil, it can absorb the water and possibly cause dehydration for the plants.
    Habibi et al. [34] presented a detection of soil salinity using machine learning
    and hyperspectral data in Sharifabad-Saveh Plain, Iran. A 93 soil samples were
    collected with the electrical conductivity, which measures with the hypercube
    technique. The sample was taken from different geographical areas, and satellite
    images from Landsat 8 were taken at different parameters such as TWI, TCI, STP,
    DEM, and LS. Figure 1 illustrates how the intensity of saltiness of the soil with
    the electrical conductivity salinity sensor probe is connected to a micro-controller.
    Use ANN, neural network, genetic algorithm, ANN-GA, PSLR, and decision tree and
    compare these algorithms on the data generated for the model’s prediction. The
    datasets are split into 70% for training sets and 30% for validation sets. ANN-GA
    has the highest accuracy prediction rate compared to other algorithms and concludes
    that it shows two dS/m EC at alfalfa and cucurbits farmlands. In contrast, pistachio
    orchards have low salinity, and bare lands have moderate and high salinity. A
    pH value is a measure of water and soil acidity. Fig. 1 Detection of salinity
    of the soil using electrical conductivity salinity sensor Full size image Processing
    soil is crucial for prepping for the crop plantation to ensure the soil is not
    acidic, i.e., pH level. Shabbir et al. [28] presented a classification model of
    pH value, alkalinity, and basicity using 40 soil images. These colored images
    were then classified using MLP, Naïve Bayes, Random forest, and Random tree algorithms
    to calculate the pH factor from the soil images. Prediction of soil moisture content
    help farmers for the proper management of water resources. It is crucial, especially
    in arid and semi-arid areas, as comparatively fewer water sources sustain agriculture.
    Cai et al. [35] proposed the deep learning regression network (DNNR) with big
    data fitting capability for constructing a soil moisture prediction model in the
    area of Beijing. The prediction results concluded that deep learning has high
    feasibility and is effective for soil moisture prediction. 6.2 Temperature and
    Humidity Prediction Temperature and humidity are some of the most significant
    factors for the propagation of the growth of plants. There is a high correlation
    between temperature and humidity, and there are high humidity chances when the
    temperature became higher. However, humidity does not necessarily increase when
    there is a temperature rise. It rather depends on the area of water mass present
    in the area, as humidity occurs due to the evaporation of the water mass. Depending
    upon the variety of crops, the changes in temperature and humidity have significant
    effects on their growth. For instance, sweet potatoes and hot peppers are likely
    to thrive in places with higher temperatures, whereas apple, barley, wheat, etc.,
    are adaptive toward places with cold temperatures. Technological advancement brought
    the ability to monitor these parameters and even control according to the optimum
    requirements of the plants with the help of sensors and artificial intelligence
    systems. Moreover, with the help of several experiments samples from across the
    globe in the form of datasets, we could predict the optimum parameters for sustaining
    the growth of specific plants despite the geographical areas and places. Taki
    et al. [36] presented a prediction of the environment variables inside the greenhouse.
    The traditional prediction model is not viable to solve the nonlinear problems
    as the atmosphere inside the greenhouse is a nonlinear system. Artificial neural
    networks and support vector machines are adopted to predict and evaluate greenhouse
    variables such as correlation and energy exchange, including the soil, air, and
    plant temperature. The environmental factors which influence the temperature inside
    and outside, such as wind speed, air temperature/humidity, and solar radiation,
    were collected for samples in datasets. Kim et al. [37] developed a prediction
    model for controlling the temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse. Machine
    learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks,
    and multiple regression were implemented for the prediction model and evaluated
    the information in the datasets. The datasets comprise different seasons, summer,
    monsoon, autumn, and winter, on given parameters. It has been concluded that an
    artificial neural network has the highest accuracy with the selected dataset,
    while the multiple regression model has acquired the highest accuracy with the
    complete datasets. Jung et al. [38] adopted nonlinear autoregressive exogenous
    model, NARX; and recurrent neural networks—Long Short-Term Memory, RNN-LSTM; artificial
    neural network (ANN) for the prediction model of the environmental changes and
    their impacts on plants growth within the greenhouse. This model helps to determine
    the optimum temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide for plant growth and management
    strategies. RNN-LSTM acquired the highest accuracy over any other algorithm staggering
    up to 96% accuracy. It has been proved that the potential capabilities of machine
    learning techniques in prediction model and effective management of greenhouse
    to sustain the optimum intensity of the parameters; temperature, humidity, and
    carbon dioxide for precision agriculture. 6.3 Plant Pest and Disease Prediction
    Plant’s pest and disease invasion is agitating the farmers since it is challenging
    to predict because of their time, space, and genotype variability. The evolution
    of machine learning has brought Image processing techniques into the benchmark,
    which has revolutionized conventional farming systems into smart farming. Image
    processing is the process of classification of image pixels and extracts significant
    information. It performed well as it is non-destructive and environment friendly.
    The biological test methods required apparatus and experts, which tends to be
    expensive and also inefficient. Additionally, although DNA-based and serological
    method of plant diseases detection has revolutionized disease diagnosis, it is
    inefficient during the asymptomatic stages as it required few days to process
    in the laboratory [39]. The image processing method has the advantages of early
    detection of the lesion or blight before it gets critically injured. The feasibility
    of adopting image-based plant disease detection is much higher than any other
    method because of its cost-effectiveness and significantly higher accuracy rate.
    Ferentinos [40] presented a plant disease detection model using a Convolutional
    Neural Network. Open datasets of 87,848 plant images consisting of 58 distinct
    classes were used for training the model. These images comprise healthy and diseased
    leaf images of a different variant. The prediction result acquired a 99.53% accuracy
    rate. A Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks
    specializing in processing imagery data. Additional layers are added called the
    “Convolution layer,” which is intended for feature extraction before feeding to
    the deep neural network. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the CNN model. In
    a nutshell, it is the combination of a convolution layer with a deep neural network.
    A filter known as the kernel is stridden across the pixels in the convolution
    layer, and the dot product is obtained. The activation function is then applied
    to the result, followed by pooling. This process is repeated many number of times.
    The convoluted pixels data are flattened and fed to the neural network for the
    prediction process. Fig. 2 The architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN)
    Full size image Saleem et al. [41] presented how machine learning and deep learning
    evolved over the years. The comparison between different algorithms in machine
    learning and deep learning for predicting several plant leaves has been described.
    Without visualization technique, the identification of tomato leaf disease achieved
    the best performance and accuracy rate with CNN-ResNet over AlexNet and GoogLeNet.
    For identifying disease in banana leaf, AlexNetOWTbn, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and
    VGG architectures in which VGG outperformed all the other models. Extreme learning
    machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) have
    been implemented with the deep learning models, namely ResNet-50, GoogLeNet, InceptionResNetv2,
    Inception-v3, ResNet-101, and SqueezeNet to predict the diseased leaf of a collection
    of eight different plants. Among all these models, SVM with ResNet-50 has the
    highest performance results. A traditional CNN and Super-Resolution Convolutional
    Neural Network (SRCNN) have been implemented to diagnose the cucumber disease
    and achieved 0.823 accuracies. SqueezeNet v1.1 and AlexNet models were implemented
    to detect tomato leaf diseased, and the AlexNet model happened to be higher in
    prediction accuracy than SqueezeNet v1.1. In several research works, deep learning
    (DL) models are employed with the visualization technique for the prediction of
    plant diseases. 13 types of different plant diseases were tested with the help
    of CaffeNet CNN architecture which has an accuracy rate of 96.39%, which is much
    higher than that of SVM. PlantVillage datasets are preprocessed with three parameters:
    color, grayscale, and segmented, which have been evaluated. AlexNet and GoogLeNet
    CNN are used and compared on the three parameters. It is concluded that GoogLeNet
    CNN achieved higher accuracy than AlexNet. LeNet has been used to detect the olive
    oil leaf disease. The leaf images are preprocessed with the segmentation and edge
    map technique for extracting features. Random Forest, support vector machines,
    and AlexNet models were employed to detect the four different cucumber leaf diseases.
    The leaf images were segmented to highlight the spot on the leaf. A comparative
    study was done on Faster- RCNN, RFCN, and SSD with GoogLeNet, ZFNet, VGG, ResNet-50,
    AlexNet, ResNet-101, and ResNetXt-101 for the plant disease prediction, and it
    is concluded that ResNet-50 with the detector RFCN achieved the highest accuracy.
    A plant disease prediction model has been implemented with three CNN models such
    as MobileNet-V1, ResNet-50, inception-V2 with the help of a detector SSD, and
    Faster-RCNN to diagnose banana leaf disease. AlexNet and GoogleNet were implemented
    for the tomato leaf disease prediction with the occlusion technique for extracting
    the region of the diseases. Between these comparisons, GoogleNet achieved better
    accuracy than AlexNet. A wheat disease prediction model was presented in which
    the VGG-FCN and VGG-CNN models were applied. VGG-CNN model was proposed for the
    detection of a disease in a radish called Fusarium wilt. K-means clustering is
    used for reducing the dimensionality of the diseased images. Arsenovic et al.
    [42] proposed traditional augmentation and a state-of-art Generative Adversarial
    Network (GAN) to improve the current limitation in the disease prediction model.
    The datasets have been generated, and they will mimic the real-world scenario.
    The leaf images have been generated in different weather conditions, illumination
    exposure, and different angles containing 79,265 leaf images. The augmented images
    are then fed in a novel-two-stages neural network which achieved a 93.67% accuracy
    rate. Golhani et al. [43] presented a review article on the implementation of
    an advanced neural network model with the hyperspectral imagery data. Research
    work on plant disease prediction implementing the major Neural Network types,
    models, and a classifier were discussed. Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP), Radial-Basis
    Function (RBF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial-Basis Function (RBF), Kohonen’s
    Self-Organising Map (SOM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) are some of the types of neural network adopted. The model-like
    feedforward neural network (FFNN), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN have been discussed on how it performs on the
    hyperspectral image data. Hyperspectral image data is the information that is
    collected from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The human eye can see the
    electromagnetic waves ranging from 380 to 780 nm of visible light, and the human
    eye cannot see the electromagnetic spectrum waves outside this range. Some of
    the spectrum waves are radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays,
    and gamma rays. With the use of the specific camera for capturing the electromagnetic
    spectrum, wave could generate additional information that human cannot see within
    the leaf image.   Fig. 3 a Normal leaf b hyperspectral images Full size image
    The disease prediction model with hyperspectral images could be potent because
    it can extract more information that cannot be seen physically on the leaf surface
    and cannot be captured by the traditional camera. However, it might be a little
    costlier than the conventional image processing technique where traditional cameras
    are used. It required a special camera that could extract spectrum waves apart
    from the RGB image. So, there is a trade-off between the cost and the accuracy.
    One alternative to extract more information from the image data and improve machine
    learning and the deep learning prediction model is image preprocessing. Nowadays,
    researchers have spent a reasonable amount of time implementing the actual models.
    It is the process of enhancing the images so that more information could be extracted
    and removing irrelevant information. Some of the image preprocessing parameters
    includes: Color correction Noise reduction Geometric Transformations Brightness
    and contrast correction Segmentation Edge detection Augmentation Image orientation
    correction Thresholding. These are some of the primary preprocessing parameters
    that are used to tweak the input images to improve the accuracy of the machine
    learning prediction model. Image Segmentation, Canny Edge detector, K-Means, Binary
    thresholding, Otsu’s thresholding, and adaptive thresholding are the leading studies
    in the field of image-based prediction. Figure 4 illustrates the preprocessed
    images with several image preprocessing techniques on a plant leaf. Fig. 4 Image
    preprocessing techniques Full size image 7 Material and Method Sensors and actuators
    are the vital source of information for the prediction model. These devices are
    responsible for the accumulation of relevant information around the environment.
    There are different types of sensors such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 injection
    sensors. They have their respective unique capability of sensing and gathering
    information. Figure 5 illustrates the primary sensor in the market where (a) DHT
    11 is the temperature and humidity sensors and (b) CO2 sensor is used to evaluate
    the amount of CO2 content in the air. There are electronic products from basic
    quality to high-end products in the sensing technologies, so depending upon the
    size of the projects, the material can be implemented. A carbon dioxide generator
    is a device generally used for controlling the CO2 content inside the greenhouse
    to provide the optimum condition for the plants. It sucks the oxygen from the
    open environment and converts it to carbon dioxide gases. Fig. 5 a DHT 11 b CO2
    sensor Full size image Figure 6 illustrates the basic setup for generating information
    in the form of data to predict crop growth. Initially, several numbers of plants
    were placed inside the greenhouse. A temperature and humidity sensor and CO2 sensor
    were installed inside and outside the greenhouse for comparing the parameters
    in different environments. CO2 Generator is also installed to evaluate and generate
    carbon dioxide content for optimum CO2 level for the plants’ intake. These sensors
    and actuators are connected to the controller connected to the embedded device
    or desktop through the local server, wire cable, or wifi module, which can remotely
    control these sensors. These sensors generate real-time data, which can be used
    by machine learning and deep learning models. Fig. 6 Smart greenhouse Full size
    image 7.1 Remote Sensing The Internet of Things (IoT) has been extensively growing
    since the last few decades. The advancement in IoT has paved the way for traditional
    farming to the next level. There is a huge potential in increasing productivity
    and obtain a huge global market [44]. Because of the portability and interoperability
    of the IoT technology, many agricultural industries have adopted an effective
    farming experience, which is also environment friendly. Some of the advantages
    of the Internet of Things are: Interoperability of a variety of devices across
    the globe Minimization of human intervention Time complexity Compatibility Easy
    Access Speed. Different types of sensors and actuators are available in the market
    for generating data and information on various parameters. These sensors are generally
    connected to an autonomous controller that can be programmed and powered up with
    any power source. Arduino and Raspberry Pi are the most common controllers that
    are widely used in agriculture purposes. Figure 7 illustrates the controllers,
    Arduino setup for the temperature and humidity monitoring device. Arduino is the
    most common micro-controller which is widely used for several projects. Besides
    Arduino, Raspberry Pi is also commonly used for the same projects. There is a
    bunch of other versions on these devices available depends on the objective of
    the projects. The advantages of using these controllers are the flexibility and
    ability to work with any kinds of projects such as smart irrigation systems, soil
    monitoring systems, weather forecasting models, temperature, humidity monitoring
    systems, etc. Fig. 7 Temperature and humidity monitoring using Arduino micro-controller
    Full size image The wireless sensor network technology significantly reduces human
    efforts, yet it is efficient and accurate to perform a specific task remotely.
    However, the architecture is not designed for future prediction and decision-making,
    depending on different parameters such as temperature, humidity, and climatic
    condition. These parameters are highly complex which keep on changing each year.
    Artificial intelligence is the key answer to support complex variables. 7.2 Machine
    Learning Machine Learning is broadly classified into supervised, unsupervised,
    and reinforcement learning. The labeled datasets are used in supervised learning,
    and the unlabeled datasets are used in unsupervised learning. Reinforcement learning
    deals with sequential data for the prediction. It is crucial to know the datasets
    before feeding them to the machine learning model, as each algorithm is designed
    to solve problems on specific types of datasets. Figure 8 illustrates the architecture
    of the machine learning model. The total number of datasets is divided into training
    sets and test sets using cross-validation. Training sets are fed to the machine
    learning algorithm and train to classify variables according to their traits.
    The model is then tested with the test sets for validation of the prediction.

    8 Smart Irrigation Human and industrial wastes have extensively contaminated water.
    Water scarcity has become a global concern and affects agriculture and many other
    sectors [45]. Many research works have been going on to tackle this problem and
    sustain precision agriculture to increase productivity despite the water issues.
    Water sprinkler is helpful in industries, agriculture, and gardens for watering
    purposes. The conventional automatic water sprinkler automatically spreads and
    distributes the water in the designated area by spinning the nozzle. This system
    could sound helpful in the agricultural fields. However, there could be a massive
    amount of water loss because of the soil’s moisture and climate humidity variability.
    The amount of water distribution is entirely under the farmer’s control which
    can be inaccurate. Today, with the advancement of sensor technology, several improvements
    are made with the engineering and functionalities of the traditional water sprinkler
    [46]. Rainfall Shutoff Device—This device is designed to detect raindrops water
    during rainy days. So, when it is raining, this device will see and send information
    to the water sprinkler controller to turn off the water flow which helps to compensate
    the rainwater (Fig. 9c). Soil Moisture Sensors—This sensor can monitor the soil
    moisture condition. When the soil is dry, the water sprinkler will provide the
    optimum amount of water. Otherwise, it will stop supplying water (Fig. 9a). Watersense
    Labeled Controller—The device is weather-based humidity and moisture monitoring
    device that helps the sprinkler supply the optimum amount of water to the plants
    (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9 a Soil moisture sensors b watersense labeled controller c rainfall
    shutoff device Full size image Drip irrigation is the micro-irrigation system
    that supplies water by dripping slowly either to the soil’s surface or the plant’s
    root. The primary aim is to reduce wastage of water and minimize evapotranspiration.
    It is cost-effective and sustainable. Figure 10 illustrates the working architecture
    of drip irrigation. Initially, a water tank is set up for the supply of water
    which is connected to a valve or a controller for switching the water flow on
    and off. Several pipes are laid on the field that connects the outlet of the valve.
    These pipes have an emitter interval for the outlet drop of water directly to
    the soil surface or the plants’ root. Fig. 10 Drip irrigation Full size image
    Although drip irrigation helps to save a tremendous amount of water, it can be
    improved further with the help of the machine learning and deep learning model.
    Traditionally, the drop of water is continuous in every interval regardless of
    any parameters around the soil and environment. The ground and moisture level
    temperature are the primary parameters to identify whether the soil’s moisture
    level is high. This is when machine learning and deep learning model comes in
    handy. With these technologies, we can predict supplying an optimum amount of
    water concerning the temperature and moisture of the soil. Seyedzadeh et al. [47]
    presented an AI-based drip irrigation system with uniform emitter discharge regarding
    the temperature and pressure. The emitter outlet nozzle is simulated with the
    AI-based model on specific parameter settings with a temperature of 13–53 ℃ and
    operating pressure of 0–240 kPa variance. Least square support vector machine
    (LS-SVM), neuro-fuzzy c-Means clustering (NF-FCM), artificial neural network (ANN),
    and neuro-fuzzy sub-clustering (NF-SC) were adopted in which LS-SVM model achieved
    the lowest error followed by the NF-SC model. Goap et al. [48] presented an IoT-based
    irrigation management system using a Machine Learning model. Parameters like soil
    temperature, soil moisture, and environmental condition, UV radiation, and humidity
    of the field were taken as a medium of measurement for the prediction. An IoT
    sensor and actuators are implemented to generate information of several parameters
    and collected over the cloud using web services and web-based information visualization.
    K-means clustering methods and support vector regression are used to predict humidity,
    soil moisture, and weather forecasting based on the sensors data. Vij et al. [49]
    presented an IoT and machine learning-based automated field irrigation system.
    Distributed Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is established on the farm to monitor
    and sense temperature and the weather parameters are connected to the standard
    server. The implementation of Machine Learning would support the prediction of
    irrigation management based on the parameters. This model helps in the supply
    and management of water much precisely and efficiently. Water infiltration of
    the soil is one of the most crucial parameters for irrigation in agriculture [50].
    Figure 11 shows the variability of water infiltration on several types of soil.
    For instance, some soil-like Sandy loam has bigger pores inside the ground, making
    the water infiltration much more accessible, while some other soils need more
    water. The variability in the water infiltration can significantly affect the
    plants’ growth since some plants have deeper roots. Moreover, there are limitations
    for the moisture sensor as the sensitivity frequency radiates within the upper
    layer of the soil, as shown in Fig. 11. To solve these challenges, an AI-based
    model is the most feasible model for predicting and evaluating soil infiltration
    despite the variance in soil type. Fig. 11 Water infiltration on different types
    of soil Full size image Sayari et al. [51] presented a water infiltration prediction
    model for a sustainable irrigation management system. Artificial intelligence
    models which include Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), artificial
    neural network (ANN), Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Group Method of Data
    Handling (GMDH), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Firefly Algorithm (FA) have
    been proposed for forecasting the water infiltration to sustain the irrigation
    system. The data are collected from published literature and field experiments
    conducted on researching farm at SBUK University, Kerman, Iran. Several parameters
    are used for the prediction model, which includes the inflow rate (Q), furrow
    length (L), cross-sectional area of inflow (Ao), advance time at the end of the
    furrow (TL), and infiltration opportunity time (To). For the evaluation of the
    prediction model, the mean absolute error (MAE), the correlation coefficient (R2),
    the root mean square (RMSE), the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE), and the
    index of agreement (IA) were used for the proposed AI models. Groundwater is one
    of the resources for human consumption and the development of the country. The
    agricultural sector is the primary consumer of groundwater globally [52]. So,
    crop productivity is highly dependent on the groundwater in which any threat to
    sustainability could potentially have an adverse effect on vegetation. Groundwater
    is vulnerable because of the constant climate change and anthropogenic activities.
    This deterioration has made it unsuitable for drinking and vegetation. This problem
    has become a global concern as it could threaten the agricultural sector and,
    most importantly, human livelihood. Studies and researches have been concentrated
    to sustain the groundwater. Many material, methods, and AI-based models are also
    proposed to evaluate and improve the groundwater quality, in which the results
    tend to be promising. El Bilaliet al. [53] developed groundwater quality classification
    model using groundwater quality indexes which include Potential Salinity (PS),
    Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Sodium Percentage (ESP), Sodium Adsorption Ratio
    (SAR), Exchangeable Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), and the Residual Sodium
    Carbonate (RSC) parameters through electrical conductivity (EC), Temperature (T),
    and pH as inputs. For the evaluation, Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost),
    support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied.
    The sample data of 520 images were collected the groundwater quality parameters
    from fourteen different places in Morocco. It is concluded that the Adaptive Boosting
    (Adaboost) and Random Forest (RF) have achieved a higher accuracy rate in the
    prediction model. In agriculture, farmers’ experiences are valuable and essential
    for the sustenance of productivity. Their experiences and skills are difficult
    to share and pass on as it requires efforts. This type of traditional farming
    is laborious and consumes more time. To fix these challenges, Chang et al. [54]
    presented machine learning-based smart irrigation model LoRa P2P networks to automatically
    learn the parameters of irrigation experience inside the greenhouse. The models
    calculate the optimum water requirements depending upon the temperature/humidity
    of the air, soil, light intensity, and environmental conditions. This model will
    reduce time consumption as the optimum settings have been evaluated, and it is
    comprehensive for the farmers and agrarian to follow and carry on to sustain precision
    agriculture. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the agriculture industry
    is constantly growing, and it helps to monitor the field with high scalability,
    low cost, and efficiency. The modern smart UAV are generally equipped with imagery
    systems and electromagnetic sensors, generating multispectral and hyperspectral
    images. These images are the combination of RGB images and wavelength beyond the
    visible light, electromagnetic spectrum bands such as infrared rays, x-ray, radiation,
    and ultraviolet. Spectral imaging can extract more information from the wavelength
    that even a human eye cannot see. In agriculture, this technology could be significantly
    helpful in monitoring the fertility and water status in the soil on a large area
    of land. Romero et al. [55] presented an AI-based water status estimation model
    using the UAV platform. With the help of a UAV drone, the multispectral images
    of vegetation indices are captured to estimate grapevines’ midday stem water potential.
    The artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the water estimation model,
    and the result shows a high correlation between the two parameters, such as vegetation
    index and the water potential. Figure 12 illustrates the multispectral images
    captured from the UAV drones on the agricultural fields. From Fig. 12, the green
    and red colors are the electromagnetic spectrum waves that are invisible to the
    human eye. Depending on the parameters, the electromagnetic waves are captured.
    It is generally used in the vegetation index, dryness, and wetness of the field.
    In fact, it can scan the soil type of several areas, which can be significant
    information for an AI-based prediction model. Fig. 12 UAV multispectral imagery

    agriculture highly depends on the yield prediction and irrigation system. Crop
    productivity primarily depends on multiple factors such as temperature/humidity,
    water content, minerals, light, etc., and the growing plants need to meet the
    optimum environment for their proper growth. This chapter has discussed the potential
    deterioration of the climatic parameters caused by several human activities that
    can significantly affect crop productivity. It also discussed the general idea
    of how the IoT and artificial intelligence technologies have gradually developed
    in the farming sector and how it improves the efficiency and accuracy of prediction
    on several agricultural parameters. Since the unpredictability and variability
    of the weather make traditional farming vulnerable, the emergence of the technological
    model in the agricultural sector is broadly presented. IoT and artificial intelligence
    are some of the most feasible solutions for the challenges in farming practices
    and to sustain precision agriculture. However, there are several challenges in
    the implementation of the technological model and room to improve for higher accuracy
    and efficiency. In the future work, emphasis will be given to how AI technology
    can technically improve and support the prediction efficacy of remote sensing
    technology on different agriculture parameters. Also, the scope of image processing
    using several Imagery data such as hyperspectral images, chlorophyll fluorescence
    images, and spectrum images. References Chang, D., Kim, G.: The impact of climate

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu, China SECTION 1. Introduction As
    one of the important parts of precision farming (PF) technical architecture, spatial
    decision support system (SDSS) for PF is a kind of software which can be used
    to meet the needs of quantitative analysis and intelligent decision-making support
    in precision farming production. Through farmland-related spatial information
    analysis, the SDSS for PF is able to provide decision-making services for agricultural
    production, and support intelligent farm machinery in practice. The research of
    SDSS for PF is very meaningful for popularizing and applying technologies of precision
    farming. Most of the current spatial decision support systems for PF are desktop
    based or website based soft wares[1], which would be difficult to maintain and
    update because the data and system functions are closely coupled. It is also hard
    to share information and achieve interoperability among these soft wares because
    they were established into isolated islands of information. The problems above
    have already lead the extraordinary waste of resource, and because of these problems,
    the current spatial decision support system for PF are not capable of responding
    the changes from the market based agricultural production. In short, the current
    SDSS for PA have restricted the development of PF because of their inherent shortcomings,
    it is urgently necessary to develop next generation SDSS for PF, which would be
    on-demand, much more open, and easy to maintain and update. In recent years, the
    rises of web service technology promote the development of software architecture
    from traditional mode (Host, Client/Server, Browser/Server style) to network interactive
    mode[2]. This web service based software architecture mode can cope with the inherent
    shortcomings of traditional systems, so it is possible to design and establish
    an open, loosely coupled SDSS for PF by using the architecture. The paper studied
    the suitable spatial analysis and decision-making methods for precision fertilization
    and irrigation. On this basis, the paper analyzed the possibility of the system
    construction, and provided blueprint and implementation solution of the SDSS for
    PF. The blueprint of web service components collection, which would be used to
    implement the analysis and decision-making functions of SDSS for PF were also
    been studied in the paper. At the end of the paper, several key technologies of
    the system construction were discussed. SECTION 2. GIS web service & its application
    As a new kind of software architecture, web service is composed of 3 participators
    and 3 basic operations. Three participators are: service provider; service requester
    and service agent, and three operations are publishing; finding and binding. The
    basic architecture of typical web service can be described as follows: a service
    were published onto a service agent menu by its provider, when service requester
    wants to call the service, it will firstly search this service from the menu provided
    by the service agent, so as to get the information of how to call the service,
    finally, the requester can call the service published by the provider through
    the service description information. It should be figured out that the service
    provider and the requester will communicate directly after the requester gets
    the service information from agent. Web service implements related functions by
    using a series of criterions and protocols. For a example: it uses WSDL (web service
    description language) to describe service, uses UDDI (universal description, discovery,
    integration) to publish and find service, and uses SOAP(simple object access protocol)
    to call service. Messages in XML format are transferred among web service components
    and component internal, because message in XML format is easy to read and understand,
    and it is accepted by most of the platforms, such as Microsoft windows, UNIX,
    Linux, etc. GIS web service is a combination of web service and GIS technology[3].
    It is designed specially for managing, analyzing and publishing geospatial information.
    Comparing to traditional GIS, GIS web service own characteristics of cross-platform,
    scalable, good maintainability, and high degree of standardization, it has obvious
    advantages in dealing with problems such as spatial data sharing, software reuse
    and reducing the cost of system integration. For example, through its standard
    interface, geospatial data web service helps user search and obtain geospatial
    data published by different providers from internet, so as to realize geospatial
    data sharing. Through reconstructing current GIS, building service components
    and providing regular interfaces, GIS web service can call each other to realize
    software reuse. While GIS web service provides new technique of system integration.
    Comparing to the object-oriented or message based system integration techniques;
    it can be much more efficiently in coping with the integration problems of heterogeneous
    systems. Many GIS web service applications have already appeared recently. ESRI,
    a leader of GIS companies, established “Arc Web Services” as a GIS web service
    architecture to provide a series of spatial information related services; further
    more, most of the services had been registered to the UDDI registration center.
    “ArcGIS Server”, as the first GIS web service product brought by ESRI, provides
    tools for users to customize and publish GIS web service, such as raster calculation,
    etc. “Map Point”, which was brought by Microsoft also provides several GIS web
    services, including location service, route selection service, etc. Besides, web
    service architecture recommended by OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) has already
    been successfully applied in the geospatial information infrastructure construction
    of Germany and Canadian in 2002, and the famous geospatial information gateway:
    www.geodata.gov is also a successful application of web service. Most of farmland-related
    information, such as soil, crop and weather information, has spatial relativity.
    Precision farming, including precision fertilization and irrigation, focuses on
    farmland-related information and its collecting, processing and analysis. While,
    agricultural production in different area is tremendous difference, so establishing
    region-suitable precision agriculture services based on GIS web service, and integrate
    into a loosely coupled application to share data and reuse function is an ideal
    solution to meet the needs of precision farming in different area. SECTION 3.
    GIS web service based SDSS of PF Through analyzing kinds of decision-making workflows
    of agricultural production and effectively using GIS web service to build decision-making
    services based on the demands of precision farming production. SDSS for PF was
    constructed based on the integration of decision-making services and farmland-related
    spatial information. System analysis of the SDSS, including system roles, system
    architecture, and workflows, were discussed as follows. 3.1 System roles of the
    SDSS System roles mainly include users, equipments, and soft wares. According
    to the difference of authorization, system roles were divided into 4 classes:
    junior role, senior role, data provider, and service provider. Junior role was
    authorized to download specific analysis and decision-making results to process
    corresponding practice, senior role was authorized to find decision-making service,
    spatial analysis service and spatial data based on the needs of specific job,
    then complete the workflow of modeling, deploying, and executing so as to get
    the result. Service provider was authorized to develop and publish kinds of web
    services of spatial decision-making for precision farming. Data provider was authorized
    to produce and publish spatial data in different area. 3.2 Architecture of the
    SDSS Web service-driven service-oriented architecture (SOA) was selected to establish
    the SDSS for PF in this paper. According to the regulations of service description,
    registration, finding and interoperability, the SDSS for PF separated service
    provider and service requester. Based on technologies of enterprise service business
    (ESB), including communication, message processing and security control, the SDSS
    for PF designed a series of tiers, including client tier, application tier, service
    tier, and data tier of the architecture. Interactive mechanism among tiers and
    security management was also been established, the whole architecture of SDSS
    for PF was shown in figure 1. Client tier is the entrance for junior role and
    senior role. Senior role are supported to operate the SDSS based on specific job
    and get the decision-making results. Junior role, which including intelligent
    farm machinery, client software, and outside web service, were supported to download
    the decision-making results for further processing, or directly apply to the agricultural
    production. Application tier provides tools for finding, matching, integrated
    modeling, and combination of services & data. According to the specific decision-making
    demand of precision fertilization or irrigation, application tier provides high
    efficiency service finding and matching tool based on service description. Visualized
    environment was also provided by application tier to complete service validation
    and integrated modeling. Besides, environment of service execution was built to
    call service and create service instance, and control the activation, hanging
    up, resuming, and termination of service instances. Service tier provides 4 web
    service collections: basic services collection, spatial analysis service collection,
    decision-making service collection, and assistant service collection, these services
    can call each other, and be called by application tier through ESB. Service tier
    is also the entrance for service provider to publish and manage services, service
    register center and a series of service manage tools are deployed in the service
    tier to help service provider complete the tasks of service registering, publishing
    and monitoring. Data tier stores all kinds of data which can be called by application
    tier. Besides, metadata management center, an environment for data providers to
    publish and manage all kinds of data of SDSS, was been deployed at data tier.
    Figure 1: Architecture of SDSS for PF Show All 3.3 Workflows of the SDSS SDSS
    for PF would respond and analyze the request of specific decision-making task
    of agricultural production, and then it would select a prepared workflow template
    which is suitable for the specific decision-making task. Based on the template,
    SDSS would establish a new workflow for the specific task using services combination
    modeling tool (SCMT). According to the workflow, corresponding GIS web services
    and spatial data would be found, and describing documents would be generated.
    The services combination execution tool (SCET) would startup the service execution
    engine. After receiving the task, the service execution engine would call corresponding
    web services and spatial data to execute the workflow according to the document.
    During the executing course, it would return status messages to monitoring tools,
    and give the result to user when the execution is complete. The whole workflow
    of SDSS for PF was shown in figure 2. Figure 2: Workflow of the PF SDSS Show All
    SECTION 4. Key technologies of constructing the PF SDSS There are several key
    technologies in constructing SDSS for PF, which including multi-source geospatial
    data based decision-making model creating, GIS web services implementation, and
    SOA based system designing, etc. 4.1 Geospatial decision-making models Spatial
    decision-making models can make decision on spatial related problems based on
    multi-source geospatial data and its analysis result. Through research on spatial
    analysis demand in precision agricultural decision-making process, spatial decision-making
    models of precision farming can be established based on the geospatial analysis
    methods, such as interpolation, buffer, and raster re-class, overlay, etc. Under
    the help of remote sense image, sampling data and high precision farm/field map,
    spatial decision-making models of agriculture is able to cope with problems of
    agricultural production analysis, simulation, explanation, and forecasting. For
    example, spatial decision-making models of precision fertilization are able to
    complete the diversity analysis of farm soil, dynamic requirement analysis of
    fertilizer and the analysis of balanced fertilization. Spatial decision-making
    models of precision irrigation are able to complete the diversity analysis of
    soil moisture, regionalization analysis of irrigation and balanced irrigation
    analysis which based on specific crop water-production model. 4.2 Coarse-grained
    business service modeling SOMA (Service Oriented Modeling Architecture) was used
    as a main tool of coarse-grained service modeling in the research to build models
    during 3 stages of service identification, specification, and realization[4].
    Domain decomposing, goal-service modeling and services allocation to components
    were used to identify and realize services from a spatial decision-making request.
    While, service and message operation and corresponding operation object, regulation
    and events were built to help complete modeling and optimize analysis of decision-making
    workflow[5]. The modeling flow of SDSS for PA was shown in figure 3. Figure 3:
    Web services modeling Show All 4.3 Implementation of spatial decision-making web
    service No matter how the service modeling works, services should be allocated
    to soft components ultimately. A common solution of service allocation is reflecting
    the operation scope directly to the service component or component collection,
    so as to realize the consistency between services and components[6]. Figure 4:
    GIS web service & its'' workflow in SDSS for PF Show All According to the decision-making
    requirements of precision fertilization and irrigation, we designed corresponding
    service components, and also established the interface criterion and accessing
    protocol for service components, which was shown in figure 4. On this basis, 4
    service components collection: basic information services, spatial analysis services,
    intelligent decision-making services and assistant services were developed on
    Microsoft. net 2.0 platform. SECTION 5. An instances of the PF SDSS As an instance
    of the PF SDSS, wheat remote diagnoses and decision-making system was shown as
    Figure 5. It is a web browser based application. The construction of this application
    was based on the methodology of component, which including component based analysis,
    design, development and deployment. According to the component design method of
    “Top-to-Down”, Wheat remote diagnoses and decision-making system was buildup by
    three levels from top to down, which include application system level, business
    composite level, and function component level. According to the component development
    and deployment method, Selecting existed function components and developing new
    components according to the system requirement was the first step of the system
    development, the second step was components arrangement and combination, so as
    to create business composites, these composites would be deployed onto the ESB.
    While complete the job of business composites construction, the following step
    was selecting suitable customized template and completing the job of user interface
    customization. After all these steps down, wheat remote diagnoses and decision-making
    system was created. It can help farmers make decision though internet in precision
    fertilization and irrigation. Figure 5: An instances of the PF SDSS Show All SECTION
    6. Conclusion GIS web service is able to effectively cope with the traditional
    GIS applications'' problems such as difficult to maintain, lacking of good interoperability
    and hard to integrate with other systems, etc. The paper gave the solution on
    how to establish a spatial decision-making support system for precision farming
    based on GIS web service, main components of the system and the spatial decision-making
    workflows were discussed in the paper. Precision fertilization and precision irrigation,
    as examples, were used to describe key technologies of GIS web service based SDSS
    for PF. The research result shows that GIS web service is suitable for developing
    Spatial decision-making Support System for PF, and GIS web service based applications
    has obvious advantages in dealing with problems such as sharing spatial data,
    software reuse and reducing the cost of system integration. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This

  description: The deployment of precision agriculture is inevitable due to the scarcity
    of arable land. Many countries such as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have deploy
    sensor networks and actuators to monitor growth of the crops and the surroundings
    to activate smart fertigation and irrigation system. Nevertheless, the choice
    of suitable messaging protocol is challenging due to the nature of precision agriculture
    system. For an efficient and effective solution, the precision agriculture system
    cannot rely on a single protocol because it need to work across several devices
    such as sensors, cameras, drones, robotics etc. In this paper, a lightweight messaging

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jeju Island, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction
    The amount of electronic devices connected to the Internet worldwide has been
    growing tremendously in recent years. Gatner [1] predicted that by 2020, there
    will be approximately 5.8 billion of IoT devices, with 21.5% increase from 2019.
    The proliferation of IoT has seen an increased in precision agriculture application.
    One of the main characteristics of precision agriculture is machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communications between multiple devices such as sensors, robots and drones
    and IoT gateway. These devices are usually installed in isolated area with limited
    Internet connectivity. In such environment, packet loss rate will be high, making
    it a challenge for massive deployment. One of the aspects that deciding the M2M
    communication performance is the application layer protocol, that required to
    be customized for M2M communications within constrained IoT related applications.
    It is always a daunting and challenging task for any organization to decide on
    a standard and effective messaging protocol. Unlike the Web which can works by
    using a single standard HTTP protocol, each IoT applications have distinct requirements.
    No protocol that can satisfy all of these requirements [2]. As a consequences,
    various messaging protocols are introduced for developers to select for satisfying
    different types of requirements in IoT system. AMQP [3] was introduced as a corporate
    messaging protocol that designed for security, reliability, interoperability and
    provisioning [4]. AMQP provides flow control with quality of services (QoS). In
    AMQP, either the publisher or subscriber creates an “exchange” with a given name.
    Subsequently, the name is being broadcast. Publishers and subscribers are then
    use the given name to find each other. Next, a consumer is then create a queue
    and subsequently attaches the queue to the “exchange” simultaneously. Messages
    collected by the exchange is bind to the queue. AMQP is a connection-oriented
    protocol which runs on TCP as its transport protocol and TLS/SSL and SASL for
    security [5]. AMQP is lightweight with 8-bytes fixed header with no limit for
    the size of the message [6]. CoAP [7] was introduced by IETE CoRE (Constrained
    RESTful Environments) Working Group based on Representational State Transfer (REST)
    architecture to provide low power, low overhead interface in constrained network.
    CoAP supports request-response and publish-subscribe model using Universal Resource
    Identifier (URI) to send data from publisher to subscriber. When there is a publisher
    publishes a new data to the URI, all the subscribers will be notified about the
    new value as indicated by the URI. CoAP is a connectionless protocol that uses
    UDP as its transport protocol and DTLS for security [8]. CoAP supports content
    negotiation to express a preferred representation of a resource. This will isolate
    client with the server, so that they can evolve independently without affecting
    one another. MQTT [9] is a publish/subscribe based M2M messaging protocol that
    is used on top of the TCP/IP protocol stack. It was designed as a lightweight
    broker-based protocol with small packet size, low bandwidth and high latency connection.
    In MQTT, a message is published by a publisher into a channel, which is known
    as a ‘topic’. Whoever interested to a particular topic can subscribe to it. All
    subscribers subscribed to a topic will receive every messages that have been published
    to that topic. A centralised broker server handles the communication between publishers
    and subscribers and distributes messages between them. The centralised broker
    collects all the topics and handles all the message forwarding between publishers
    and subscribers. However, such centralised protocol suffers from poor scalability
    problem [10]. In addition, they hardly have any locality-awareness because the
    centralised broker needs to manage all the subscribers, and the location of this
    centralised broker cannot be changed [11]. In order to enhance the scalability
    of publish/subscribe messaging, there are various approaches with no centralised
    broker have been proposed. Several middlewares have been proposed to address the
    interoperability of IoT protocols. The common design patterns used in these protocols
    are service oriented, publish/subscribe oriented, software defined network-based
    and virtual machine based design. Cheng [12] proposed a lightweight IoT service
    mashup middleware based on REST-style architecture for IoT applications. The design
    comprises six components that connected in a pipeline to provision the IoT services.
    These components are namely physical sensor layer, uniform resource access framework
    layer, uniform message space layer, service mashup layer, open service interface
    layer and applications layer. The proposed middleware is able to dynamically manage
    the physical sensory devices and its corresponding protocols. In addition, a distributed
    publish/subscribe-based messages distribution service was shown to provide better
    response time with an increase of concurrent instances. Although it provides a
    way to create applications for IoT, it does not support data analytics [13], an
    important features required for precision agriculture. In addition, it does not
    address the communication protocols in the application layer for video streaming
    [14], which can be used to understand the growth rate of the crops. SECTION II.
    Related Work Application layer plays an important roles to provide services and
    ensures there is an effective communication between application programs within
    a network. Thus, the process of selecting an appropriate application layer protocol
    is a prerequisite to understand a specific IoT application based on its data-sharing
    demands. Traditionally, most of the web applications depends on HTTP. However,
    IoT applications cannot depend on a single protocol to meet all its use case’s
    requisites. In the past, many emerging protocols have been made available to developers
    which varies due to different needs of the IoT-based applications. Middlewares
    that allow integration of loosely coupled distribution systems with advanced message
    oriented approach have been proposed to provide versatility and modularity to
    IoT applications. Impala [15] implemented non virtual machine based middleware
    that allows functionality of application to be adaptable easily. It handles requests
    and responses asynchronously. Milan [16] filled in the gap in providing management
    tools required by different network applications. The middleware allows applications
    to specify the policy to manage and adjust the network characteristics. PRISMA
    [17] is proposed to address the needs of programminng abstraction through the
    use of RESTful APIs and QoS mechanisms to meet applications constraints. By providing
    an open RESTful APT for data access, PRISMA supports interoperability of the heterogeneous
    devices based on network technologies. In order to cope with the dynamic execution
    of IoT domain, PRISMA uses publish/subscribe paradigm to implement the asynchronous
    communication between devices. Although many protocols and middleware have been
    proposed in the past to ensure effective communication in IoT environment, most
    of the proposed work are not specific to precision agriculture. As such Farmbeats
    [18], an IoT platform for data-driven precision agriculture was developed. The
    platform was developed to collect data from various sensors and ensure that the
    system is available even during power outages. It was then transition to cloud
    platform built on top of Azure. Although the platforms offer web-based environments
    for precision agriculture, users need to subscribe to Azure cloud. In order to
    satisfy the protocol requirements, system designer should be taking accounts of
    the devices (which can be ranged from the resource-constrained IoT edge-nodes
    to the resourceful clouds), the data (which can be produced either at the IoT
    edge, fog, or cloud layers), and the communication architecture of the system.
    SECTION III. Lightweight Messaging Middleware (Lmm) In precision agriculture,
    it is important to couple IoT sensors for nutrient monitoring with image processing
    for disease and growth analysis. Thus, the system should be have the capability
    in supporting devices such as robots, sensors and cameras as shown in Fig. 1.
    Nevertheless, most of the proposed protocols are meant for IoT sensors only. The
    proposed lightweight messaging middleware (LMM) is designed so that the end nodes
    can be used to capture both images and sensor date in IoT gateway and send them
    to server for postprocessing. The main features of LMM are: Interconnections between
    connection-oriented and connectionless services and data streams. Provides authentication
    of data source and confidentiality of data. Small data overhead and ability to
    support multiple application layer protocols Able to deployed in large precision
    agriculture system. To integrate these features, LMM interconnect two (2) application
    layer protocols namely CoAP is used to stream video images to analyse growth rate
    and MQTT, which is used for sensor data as shown in Fig. 2. The reason CoAP is
    used to stream video images is because it is lightweight protocol stack. Besides,
    CoAP also conserves energy and save bandwidth. CoAP that relies on UDP as its
    transport protocol, which neither provides guarantee for message delivery nor
    congestion control mechanism is suitable for precision agriculture. Unlike IoT
    sensors that capture small size data, IoT camera produces a huge capacity of data
    packets before it can be process the image for disease detection or growth rate
    analysis. The streaming of video/image feed is time consuming as the transmission
    of many data packets, which is also consuming high bandwidth. Although the video/image
    compression techniques implemented has significantly reduced the required bandwidth,
    the MTU size and data rate is still high as compared to IoT sensor. As such IoT
    camera will require UDP whereas sensor will use publish/subscribe architecture
    with minimal bandwidth requirements, message data overhead and power consumption.
    MQTT is used as application layer protocol for IoT sensor because it has lower
    delay than CoAP messages at lower packet loss rate and the message size is very
    small. LMM will published messages to the broker via an address known as ‘topic’.
    The client that resides in server will then receive the published messages by
    subscribing to that topic. Fig. 1. Overview of precision agriculture system Show
    All Fig. 2. Lightweight Messaging Middleware (LMM) Show All LMM contains common
    API calls to support publish-subscribe model for MQTT and CoAP namely Connect(),
    ConnectAck(), publishMessage() and PublishAck. Connect() and ConnectAck() is used
    by LMM to request connection between IoT gateway and cloud server or broker. The
    connection will determine whether the IoT gateway has adequate access rights to
    publish messages over that specific topic to the server/broker. Connect() API
    call contains destination and secretkey as arguments. No additional information
    is added to simplify the connection authentication process so that the traffic
    overhead is small. The destination varies, depending on whether it is CoAP or
    MQTT message. Through Connect() and ConnectAck() API call, the precision agriculture
    system can ensure authentication of data source and confidentiality of data. publishMessage()
    API call contains arguments such as topic, destination and message. When LMM received
    sensor data from precision agriculture system, it will published the topic through
    the broker, which is the destination IP address. Similarly, LMM will published
    the topic through URI when LMM received video/image data from the system. PublishAck()
    contains acknowledgement message sent from server to client as shown in Fig. 3.
    Fig. 3. LMM sequence diagram Show All There are three (3) parts in LMM, publish/subscribe
    interface, middleware database and application functions. The publish/subscribe
    interface handles the incoming data, the topic it subscribed, published, cancelled
    or registered. Information such as message sets, that contains latest message
    related to the topics and topic subscription table are stored in middleware database.
    Each item in topic subscription table contains topic, destination and message.
    The data collected by middleware database is then processed by application functions
    to match the traffic type and route it accordingly. LMM will perform the route
    messages from sensor/camera to relevant API calls. In order to maintain the data
    distribution consistency, the application function will synchronize the information
    based on the message routing policy. Fig. 4 illustrates the LMM architecture.
    Fig. 4. LMM architecture Show All SECTION IV. Use Case: Precision Agriculture
    System LMM is built on Raspberry Pi 4 using node.js framework that are event-driven,
    allowing it to support high concurrency. The proof of concept (POC) is conducted
    on precision agriculture system that collects pH, temperature, electrical conductivity
    (EC), total dissolved solution (TDS) and camera images. Sensor/camera nodes will
    send/publish sensor data to LMM and LMM will aggregate these information before
    sending it to cloud services. Fig. 5 illustrates the proof of concept (POC) of
    the middleware in precision agriculture system. The web server subscribes to the
    camera feed using CoAP and sensor data using MQTT. Fig 6 shows the print out logs
    of the script running in Raspberry Pi. Fig. 5. Use case of LMM in precision agriculture
    system Show All Fig. 6. LMM PM2 logs Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper,
    a middleware for precision agriculture system is proposed to support multi-protocol
    implementation needed in the system. The integration of MQTT and CoAP as application
    layer protocol in the middleware support detailed analysis of impact of environment
    versus growth of the crops. As future work, the performance of LMM will be evaluated.

    1. Introduction Row crop corn and soybean production in the Midwestern US region
    has economic and environmental concerns, based on an increasing trends in the
    application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers [1]. Operational costs and
    fuel consumption costs have increased with a decrease in labor productivity [1].
    As a result, sustainable practices such as profitability (return on investments),
    operational cost reduction, hazardous waste reduction, delivery performance and
    overall productivity might be adopted through IoT-based precision agriculture
    applications, namely variable rate irrigation, variable rate fertilization, cloud-based
    analytics, and telematics for farm machinery navigation to improve agriculture
    operations and net profitability. However, [2] note the low rate of adoption for
    variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide (8%), variable rate irrigation
    (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics (10%) amongst Midwestern
    US row crop producers. The technical and operational barriers include operational
    costs, power consumption requirements, communication range limitations, data latency,
    data scalability, data storage, data processing and data interoperability and
    are highlighted in the literature [3,4,5]. This paper explores answers to the
    following questions: what are barriers to the adoption of IoT-based precision
    agriculture (PA) practices among row crop producers, how are the barriers operationally
    defined, and how are they related to each other? Section 2 highlights research
    background, discussing related PA literature on technologies and barriers to the
    adoption of IoT-based PA practices, Section 3 describes materials and methods
    adopted for this study based on semi-structured focus group interviews conducted
    with subject matter expertise (SME) (n = 18), Section 4 presents results from
    thematic content analysis of interview data describing operational definitions
    of variables and their relationships, Section 5 discusses results and significance
    in reference to previous studies, and Section 6 describes conclusions highlighting
    major takeaways, limitations and future research. 2. Background This section highlights
    research background supported by literature review on PA practices, barriers to
    the adoption of IoT-based PA practices, current adoption in the Midwestern US
    region and IoT-based wireless sensor technologies. 2.1. Precision Agriculture
    (PA) Practices Precision agriculture (PA) practices foster optimized application
    of agriculture inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides and energy
    that result in savings on the input applications, resulting in increased yield
    and improved profitability. Precision agriculture (PA) practices potentially provide
    producers with improved tools to manage inputs and optimize factors of production
    such as fertilizer, pesticides and seed application. The definition of precision
    agriculture published by the National Research Council (1997) defines precision
    agriculture as “a management strategy that uses information technology to bring
    data from multiple sources to bear on decisions associated with crop production”.
    Precision agriculture (PA) tools include information-gathering tools such as yield
    monitors, targeted soil sampling and remote sensing tools; variable rate technology;
    and guidance systems such as light bars and auto steer equipment. Precision agriculture
    technologies include soil mapping, variable rate application, yield monitoring
    mapping, automatic steer global position guidance systems and autonomous vehicles
    [6]. Management zones in the field are developed by using crop and field information.
    Varying input rates increase yields or reduce costs depending on the managers’
    goal for the management zones [7]. The potential benefits of PA practices include
    an increase in the accurate placement of inputs, reduction of machinery costs
    from an increase in machinery field capacity and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions due to reductions in input usage for a given level of production [8,9].
    Precision agriculture (PA) practices have an impact on increasing profitability,
    reducing operational costs, increasing labor productivity, reducing cycle times
    of operation, optimizing fertilizer (nitrogen & phosphate application) and decreasing
    fuel consumption in farm machinery [10]. These technologies may consist of variable
    rate application (water & fertilizer), real-time kinematic (RTK) autosteer, guidance
    systems (GPS-guided autosteers, yield monitors), submeter accuracy auto steering
    (SUB) and telematics. In a study by [11], the authors note the impact of PA technologies,
    such as autosteer guidance, automatic section control spray application and real-time
    kinematic precision tractor operations on the carbon emission and economic operational
    cost in the corn and soybean production in the US state of Kentucky. The findings
    indicate that automatic section control spray application has the capability to
    spray more precisely, reducing the over-application of inputs and giving a mean
    net return of 0.47% [11]. Real-time kinematic precision tractor operations provided
    the most significant improvement in carbon footprint ratio of 2.74% with increased
    technical efficiency in applying nitrogen and seeds more accurately [11]. Labor
    productivity also increased, allowing more desirable production practices to be
    employed [11]. Global navigation satellite systems-based autosteering reduces
    overlap between tractor passes and overall operator fatigue increasing productivity
    [12]. A study conducted by [13] to assess the impact of implementation of PA practices
    in potato and olive production highlighted that variable rate application (VRT)
    of potassium and phosphorus fertilizers lead to a strong reduction in nutrient
    use and an increase in operational profits of 21%, with an increase in overall
    profits of 26%. Precision agriculture (PA) can help in managing crop production
    inputs in an environmentally friendly way by utilizing site-specific knowledge
    targeting rates of fertilizers, seed and chemicals in improving soil conditions
    [14]. 2.2. Adoption of Precision Agriculture Practices among Midwestern Row Crop
    Producers The Midwestern (Indiana) region of the US has been facing environmental
    and economic sustainability issues. There has been an increase in trends for the
    application of fertilizers (nitrogen & phosphorus) and in farm machinery fuel
    costs and a decrease in labor productivity leading to non-optimized usage of farm
    inputs [1]. Precision agriculture (PA) technologies foster optimized application
    of agriculture inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides and energy,
    resulting in savings in the input applications, resulting in increased yield and
    improved profitability [12]. The adoption of PA technologies among row crop producers
    in the US Midwest region has been increasing [2]. The study conducted by [2] notes
    the adoption of different precision agriculture technologies among Midwest region
    producers. Yield monitoring technology has the highest adoption rates as 69% of
    farmers reported adopting it. Variable rate fertilizer (39%), variable rate pesticide
    (8%), variable rate irrigation (4%), cloud-based data analytics (21%) and telematics
    (10%) all reported lower adoption rates [15,16,17]. Different types of IoT sensors
    (temperature, humidity, light, pressure, wind speed) receive and collect data
    managed by cloud information management systems for data analysis solutions through
    application programming interfaces (API) [17]. A wireless sensor IoT framework
    for PA applications consists of: (1) perception layer, (2) communication layer,
    (3) processing layer and (4) application layer [4]. Therefore, it is important
    to understand the barriers and related decision factors involved in developing
    IoT-based PA applications. 2.3. Barriers to Adoption of IoT-Based Precision Agriculture
    Multiple studies note socio-economic factors (farmers’ educational level, age),
    agro- ecological factors (soil quality, farm size, ownership of land), farmers’
    perception (perceived benefits vs. profitability), technological factors (computer
    education, data aggregation) and informational factors (extension services) as
    factors having a positive relationship with adoption [16,17]. The research study
    focuses on cost, technical, operational and data management barriers highlighted
    in Figure 1 and validated in the study conducted by [3,4,5,7]. The factors include
    enumerating cost, power consumption, communication range, data latency, data scalability,
    data storage and data interoperability [3,4,5,8]. A more recent study conducted
    by [5,6,8] highlighted cost of equipment, less benefit, training, data scalability,
    communication range and time of implementation as the IoT precision agriculture
    barriers. Figure 1 highlights cost, operational, technical and data management
    barriers explored in this study. Figure 1. Cost, Technical, Operational and Data
    management barriers. Source: “Reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. [4].
    2019, Junhu Ruan”. Figure 2 highlights the different layers of IoT framework [4]
    for PA practices. This framework was used to develop the semi-structured interview
    questionnaire highlighted in Appendix B, where questions related to barriers are
    categorized under these framework layers: (1) perception layer, (2) communication
    layer, (3) data processing and (4) application layer. Figure 2. IoT framework
    layers for wireless sensors-based PA. Source: “Reprinted/adapted with permission
    from Ref. [4]. 2019, Junhu Ruan ”. Structured literature review (SLR) methodology
    described in the following section was used to identify technical and operational
    barriers to adoption of IoT-based PA practices. Internet of things (IoT) wireless
    sensors-based PA technologies, namely monitoring row crop diseases, smart irrigation,
    smart fertilizing, cloud-based analytics and telematics for farm machinery navigation,
    have a low rate of adoption among Midwestern (Indiana) region row crop producers.
    These barriers include technical (power limitations, communication range), operational
    (data scalability, sensor distribution, data latency), management (data storage,
    data interoperability & data processing) and finance (cost, return on investment).
    3. Materials and Methods This section describes the research methodology approaches
    adopted for this study. Structured literature review conducted for this study
    is described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 describes semi-structured focus group
    interviews conducted with (n = 18) subject matter expertise (SME), Section 3.3
    describes thematic content analysis approach and Section 3.4 highlights validity
    and reliability of research methods. 3.1. Structured Literature Review The research
    methodology framework followed a structured literature review and thematic content
    analysis of semi-structured focus group interviews conducted with subject matter
    expertise. Content analysis is defined as “content analysis is a research technique
    for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content
    of communication” [18]. The four-step process model of content analysis by [19,20]
    delimits the material to be analyzed by defining a unit of analysis, creating
    analytical categories, defining the material collection (creating and defining
    categories), pretesting the categories defined, refining through pretesting categories
    and analyzing the data by coding for thematic analysis. The first step was defining
    the unit of analysis, i.e., sample size of relevant peer reviewed journals and
    data reports. The period of analysis chosen was 1990–2019, and in the initial
    review a sample of n = 90 journals was selected. The peer-reviewed literature
    was selected from top-tier publishers Elsevier, Emerald, IEEE, Taylor Francis
    and Inderscience. The second step defined screening categories with inclusion
    and exclusion criteria. Preliminary research criteria were defined based on the
    broader research objectives, screening the selected unit of analysis, relevant
    theories, and a review of the initially selected sample journal articles. Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based precision agriculture technologies were used as initial
    inclusion or screening criteria. Abstract, introduction and findings of the initial
    sample were analyzed as per the research objectives, and 20 articles were screened
    out of 90 articles not meeting the initial screening criteria. The third step
    was pretesting and refining categories in which the sample of n = 70 articles
    was carefully analyzed for progressive refining and validating of the category
    scheme. The fourth and the last step was coding and analyzing the themes, as per
    defined categories in the previous step. The content themes identified for this
    study were based on keywords from the research questions explored in this research,
    i.e., “precision agriculture technologies” and “Barriers to adoption of IoT-based
    precision agriculture practices” were also used to develop the semi-structured
    focus group interview questionnaire in Appendix B 3.2. Focused Group Semi-Structured
    Interviews The data collection methods included focus group semi-structured interviews.
    In this study, a purposive sampling was adopted [21] (p. 94) to collect data from
    the SME’s involved in three focus groups interview sessions. The focus groups
    were categorized based upon the knowledge and expertise of the participants in
    three layers of IoT wireless sensors framework: (1) perception layer, (2) communication
    layer, and (3) data processing & application layer. The credentials of the participants
    and their current roles and expertise in the IoT framework layer are highlighted
    in Appendix A. The researcher contacted 22 individuals, of which 18 participated
    (response rate of 81%) in 3 focus group interview sessions (See Supplementary
    Material) with 6 participants in each session. Each of the focus groups consisted
    of at least one expert representing each layer of the IoT wireless sensor framework
    to reduce bias. The study conducted by [22] defined the term “focus group” to
    apply to a situation in which the interviewer asks group members very specific
    questions about a topic after considerable research. Focus groups are used in
    the studies to investigate complex systems where the research can interact with
    participants and there is further opportunity to ask for clarification questions.
    The study by [21] (p. 18) defines a focus group as a “carefully planned discussion
    designed to obtain perceptions in a defined area of interest in a permissive,
    non-threatening environment”. The critical element of focus group interviews is
    the involvement of people where the information encourages a nurturing environment
    [23]. Diagnosing potential problems, programs, services, products and stimulating
    new ideas results in frameworks for further validation with empirical research
    [24,25]. Because the characteristic of focus group interviews helps to investigate
    complex systems where the research may interact with the participants providing
    an opportunity to further ask for clarification questions, it was appropriate
    to adopt these research methods [21] (p. 18). The studies conducted by [23,24]
    highlighted that purposive sampling may be employed for focus group interviews
    that consist of representative members of larger populations. Most focus groups
    interviews consist of between 6–12 participants [25]. The study conducted by [25]
    suggests that “the size of the group is governed by the objectives of the research
    as well.” Smaller groups (4–6 people) are preferable when participants share information
    about the topic [21] (p. 24). The study also highlighted that the typical focus
    group interview might have up to 10–15 questions, depending upon the length of
    the interview and research objectives. The semi-structured interview questionnaire
    in Appendix B, developed for this study, consisted of 12 questions structured
    in four sections, namely (1) demographics (2) perception layer (3) communication
    layer and (4) data processing & application layer. 3.3. Thematic Content Analysis
    Data analysis is the part of qualitative research that mostly distinctively differentiates
    from quantitative research methods [26]. Qualitative data analysis is a more dynamic,
    intuitive and creative process of inductive reasoning, thinking and theorizing
    [27]. Data analysis in qualitative research is defined as the process of systematically
    searching and arranging the interview transcripts. The process of analyzing qualitative
    data involves coding or categorizing of data, which reduces the volume of raw
    information, followed by identifying significant patterns drawing meaning from
    the data, developing a logical chain of framework or adding to grounded theory
    [28]. The NVivo coding software was used to code the data from interviews. Inter-reliability
    of the coding thematic analysis of the data was checked with another rater to
    ensure the reliability kappa value k > 0.70 for acceptable reliability [29,30].
    3.4. Validity and Reliability Validity and reliability of the research design
    for this study follows a triangulation method, which is a typical practice for
    rigor in qualitative research methodologies [29,30]. Triangulation may involve
    combining multiple data sources (data triangulation), using multiple research
    methods to analyze the same problem (methodological triangulation) or using multiple
    investigators [31]. In this study, the approach of triangulation was followed
    by the researcher collecting and analyzing data from different sources, i.e.,
    the SLR (n = 70) and the three focus group interview sessions. The content analysis
    from the focus group interviews was triangulated by three non-subject matter expertise
    appraisers for inter-reliability. 4. Results This section highlights the results
    and findings from thematic content analysis conducted on the focused group interviews
    (See Supplementary Material). The frequency of emerging themes from content analysis
    conducted on focus group interviews is shown in Figure 1. How the variables are
    defined in the context of barriers and their potential relationships with each
    other are described in Table 1. Subsequently operational definitions for variables
    identified and defined through content analysis are highlighted in Table 2. Table
    1. Variable Relationships and Descriptive Content Analysis. Table 2. Operational
    Definitions. 4.1. Themes from Content Analysis Figure 3 highlights the reference
    frequency of emerging themes identified and analyzed following the content analysis
    approach on the focus group interviews (See Supplementary Material). The themes
    analyzed were as per the research questions based on identifying, exploring and
    defining variable relationships related to cost, technical (power consumption,
    wireless communication, communication range), operational (data scalability, data
    latency) and data management (data storage, data processing, data interoperability)
    barriers. Figure 3. Frequency of text references identified in focus group interview
    transcripts. The emerging themes identified through content analysis in decreasing
    order of their reference frequency are as follows. Data latency—type of wireless
    communication (9), data latency—autonomous applications (8), data storage—type
    of precision application (8), data interoperability—type of wireless communication
    (6) and data storage—type of sensor (6) were the most recurring themes identified.
    Data latency—power consumption (4), data interoperability—data storage (4), data
    interoperability—type of precision application (4) and data latency—data processing
    (4) were the other recurring themes identified. The emerging themes were explored
    further for descriptive analysis, and findings are reported in the following section.
    4.2. Variable Relationships The variable relationships identified as themes through
    the content analysis approach were further explored. The participants’ quotations
    in the context of variable relationships are reported in Table 1, along with descriptive
    analysis findings. The Kappa value for each of the themes analyzed through content
    analysis shows the reliability of findings. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient is a statistical
    measure of inter-rater reliability, which many researchers regard as more useful
    than the percentage agreement since it considers the amount of agreement that
    could be expected to occur through chance [30]. NVivo calculates the Kappa coefficient
    individually for each combination of emerging themes [31]. If the two users are
    in complete agreement about which content of the source should be coded at the
    node, then the Kappa coefficient is 1. A value between 0 and 1 indicates the scale
    of agreement. The Kappa (k) value ≤0.40 means weak agreement, between 0.40–0.75
    means good agreement and above 0.75 means excellent agreement [31]. The average
    Kappa (k) value is calculated for each individual node by using the mean k value
    calculated for each comparison rating between individual raters (n = 3 raters)
    involved, as per the typical practice mentioned in the studies [30,31]. The descriptive
    analyses for the variable relationships are interpretations from the participants’
    quotes. For instance, data latency requirements tend to depend upon power consumption,
    type of wireless communication technology and type of precision application, which
    might be important to consider before designing an IoT-based data pipeline for
    precision agriculture applications. Similarly, data scalability depends upon power
    consumption and cost requirements, which might be critical to understand for cost-
    and energy-efficient IoT wireless sensors-based data pipeline design. 4.3. Operational
    Definitions The operational definitions of variables identified through the content
    analysis approach are highlighted in the table. The operational definitions are
    stated as findings of content analysis from focus group interviews. The supporting
    participant quotes are also mentioned in Table 2. Therefore, the subjective interpretations
    for operational definitions are limited in the context of this study. 5. Discussion
    The variable relationships in the contexts of technical and operational barriers
    identified through this research might help to inform precision agriculture practitioners,
    researchers and producers. The findings are based on potential dependency relationships
    between cost, data latency, data scalability, data storage, data interoperability,
    type of sensors, type of wireless communication, type of precision agriculture
    application and power consumption, which might help to understand barriers from
    an IoT systems perspective. The findings suggest that data latency requirements
    depend on the type of precision agriculture application. For autonomous applications,
    specifically farm machinery navigation, the latency requirements are lower (ms
    or s) as compared to monitoring applications (days or weeks). Data latency further
    depends upon power consumption as low latency means higher power consumption.
    This is an important finding as it suggests that Wi-Fi/5G/4G are the suitable
    wireless communication technologies for low-latency autonomous applications. This
    finding is supported by the studies [3,4,15] where a comparative analysis based
    on power consumption and communication range is conducted for different types
    of wireless communication technologies. Another key finding based on data interoperability
    depends upon the data storage requirements as data collected from different types
    of sensors require more cloud storage compatibility to interoperate and perform
    data processing for different types and structure of data [32,33,34]. This finding
    resonates with the studies conducted by [4,32,33] which highlights the compatibility
    of cloud data storage platforms to interoperate for different types and structures
    of data coming from different types of sensors [32,33,34]. In addition, the findings
    of the study suggests that monitoring row crop diseases applications require data
    from multiple type of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, topography,
    satellite imagery data) which require more data interoperable cloud storage platforms
    [35,36]. The operational definitions for variables defined in Table 2, through
    descriptive analysis of interview data, are significant results to help digital
    agriculture practitioners, producers and researchers to understand the adoption
    barriers. Understanding the variable relationships highlighted in Table 1 might
    help to design cost- and energy-efficient solutions for IoT-based precision agriculture
    applications. 6. Conclusions The dependency of data latency requirements on power
    consumption, type of wireless communication and precision agriculture applications
    is an important finding to consider for designing IoT-based wireless sensors autonomous
    applications (i.e., smart irrigation, smart fertilization and farm machinery navigation)
    [34,35,36]. Low data latency requirements for autonomous applications and comparatively
    higher data latency for monitoring applications is an important takeaway which
    might help to design energy- and cost-efficient IoT systems [32,33,35]. Higher
    data latency means low power consumption, and therefore using low-power wider-coverage
    technology such as Lora WAN holds significance. Data interoperability depends
    upon compatibility of cloud storage to store and process different formats and
    structures of data collected from different types of sensors [36,37]. Data scalability
    depends on cost as large data require more storage and processing capabilities
    at the cloud end; the cost might be insignificant but the cost of more sensors
    collecting data is significant [37,38]. Further dependency of types of wireless
    communication on data latency, communication range and power consumption are another
    critical finding to inform stakeholders for cost- and energy-efficient wireless
    communication protocol technologies [32,34,35]. The decision variables identified
    and operationally defined through this study might be explored further for dependency
    relationships and to develop an empirically validated framework for sustainable
    IoT. Interpretation of research findings following qualitative content analysis
    approaches are subjective and have limitations in context generalizability. However,
    researchers have tried to reduce biases, keeping high rigor for reliability and
    validity of findings. The findings of this research define and describe potential
    relationships between variables which might help digital agriculture practitioners
    and researchers to develop cost- and energy-efficient IoT systems for adoption
    of precision agriculture practices. Supplementary Materials The following supporting

    Organization (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion people
    by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 [1]. To keep pace, food production must
    increase 70% by 2050. There are some obstacles to increase food production and
    produce such amount of food. Some of them are climate change; restricted availability
    of arable land; reduced productivity growth; water necessity; the impact of urbanization
    over agricultural labour; high price and low availability of energy, mainly from
    fossil fuels; among many others. Moreover, the average age of farmers is increasing
    because young people prefer going into the industry [2]. A report from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [3] enumerates all effects of climate change on
    agriculture. They are: 1) changes in extreme weather with severe flooding and
    acute water shortages areas will increase around the globe; 2) Since agriculture
    consumes 70% of the world''s fresh water supply, water management should be an
    adequate and controlled process. To mitigate these challenges, the FAO [4] recommends
    that all farming sectors should be equipped with new tools and techniques coming
    from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT). During the last decade,
    a new movement to implant digital technology on agriculture was born, which is
    known as precision agriculture [5]. It aims to optimize the yield per unit of
    farming land by using ICT tools and technologies [6]. The objective of precision
    agriculture is to achieve the best products concerning quality, quantity and economic
    conditions. Traditionally, precision agriculture makes use of sensors to monitor
    environmental conditions. To attain this objective, networks of these sensors
    are created to cover larger areas. Precision agriculture is not only attached
    to deploying on-site sensors but involving many areas related to robotics, computer
    science, and remote sensing. An example of this is the use of smartphones, which
    have been used to visualize on the field the data provided by sensors and offer
    the possibility to apply different strategies to improve productivity [7]. The
    works presented in [8], [9] exploit the use of advances in neural networks for
    weed detection and plant species identification with the purpose of optimizing
    the herbicide application. Finally, the review introduced in [10] showed the improvements
    of the spatial resolution in aerial and satellite imagery for precision agriculture
    since the late 80s, which now allows fine-grained analysis at the expense of high
    data storage and computational resources. In the last decade, a new approach to
    connect everything (sensors or actuators), as well as to monitor and act [11]
    using the Internet, was implanted in every aspect of our daily lives; this process
    has come to be called the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT describes how in the real
    world, physical things are integrated into the digital world of bits and bytes
    [12]. In general, it involves the integration of each object, such as a sensor
    or device that is connected via wired or wireless networks using the Internet.
    To connect things, the Internet Protocol (IP) is used, in which each device has
    an IP address. The IoT devices need a mechanism to communicate with the cloud
    side, which is called Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. M2M will work with
    new developments and contributes to the future of Internet [13]. Nowadays, the
    future of the Internet will not only consist of connecting people but also to
    the approach of a digital world where, ideally, everything will be connected.
    Every day farmers are producing large amounts of data that are published on the
    cloud, with the aim of delivering benefits concerning data access, synchronization
    storage and to apply some analysis, the so-called Cloud Computing (CC), to make
    decisions. New trends that appeared after CC move the computation towards the
    smart devices; the benefit is to distribute the computing between different things.
    This paradigm is called Edge Computing (EC) [14]. The connection between the IoT
    and M2M with precision agriculture have produced a new concept called “smart agriculture”
    following other M2M based implementations such as smart cities. One of the realms
    in which more great adaptation of such technologies has been incorporated is the
    viticulture. Viticulture has historically been characterized by obtaining a high-quality
    product. This has been made possible by many factors: the selection of suitable
    soil and climatic zones, the varietal vineyards and the work of the winegrowers
    in managing their vineyards. Many threats can affect quantity and quality of the
    wine. Concretely, there are some well-known plagues attacking vineyards, and they
    produce substantial losses. The vine is exposed to different types of diseases
    or harmful agents; these are classified into four types [15]. The first category,
    physiological damage or disorders in the vine that are not caused by pest and
    diseases, are generated by lack or excess of irrigation, extreme conditions due
    to meteorological factors, natural ageing, deficiencies or excesses of nutrients
    in the vine, lousy soil, irrigation with saline water, among many others. The
    second category, fungus, they can even grow in both wet and dry regions. Some
    examples of this disease are powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot and they
    can even grow well in both wet and dry regions. The third category, vine pests,
    and insects, the most damaging are those that feed on grapes, examples of them
    are: Tetranychus urticae, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Ditylenchus, Lobesia botrana,
    Colomerus viti, Eriophyes vitis or Phylloxera vastatrix, among others. Finally,
    the last category is vine diseases generated by viruses and bacteria, like grapevine
    degeneration, grapevine decline, leafroll complex or rugose wood complex. All
    these diseases impoverish the quality of the grape, and as a result, they might
    cause severe economic losses to farmers and people related to the wine industry.
    Downy mildew is probably the most studied disease, as it produces critical economic
    losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries1 . Within this context, this
    paper introduces the SEnviro platform for vineyards, which integrates the downy
    mildew model [16] for detecting the most suitable moment to treat the downy mildew
    disease. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: 1. to apply a model
    to alert when would be the suitable moment to treat the downy mildew disease in
    the vineyard context; 2. to monitor vineyard fields through a new version of the
    SEnviro platform following the IoT paradigm and; 3. to follow the edge computing
    paradigm and to mitigate the communication between ends. The remainder of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the IoT in
    edge computing, open hardware and smart agriculture. Section 3 presents the SEnviro
    Platform. Section 4 details the Goidanich model used to detect the suitable moment
    to apply treatment for the downy mildew disease. Section 5 shows the experimentation
    done to test the platform. Section 6 reviews the related work. The paper concludes
    in Section 7 with conclusions and future work. 2. Background This section is devoted
    to showing the background of the IoT, Edge Computing, and Open Hardware paradigms.
    Also, their relation with precision agriculture through GIS is detailed. 2.1.
    IoT in the edge Cisco''s report anticipates that 50 million smart objects will
    be connected to the Internet by 2020 [17]. This situation will cause “data tsunami”
    which refers to the use of the IP to achieve connectivity between these smart
    objects. This trend produces streams of potential information, which challenge
    today''s data analysis systems in a centralized server in the Cloud [18], [19],
    [20]. IoT movement has been successfully applied in healthcare [21], [22], [23],
    [24] (ambient-assisted living and telemedicine), smart home and smart metering
    [25], [26] (devices that enable the automation of common in-house activities),
    video surveillance [?] (intelligent video systems), automotive and smart mobility
    [27], [28] (intelligent transportation systems) and smart energy and smart grid
    (intelligent management of energy distribution and consumption) [29]. All these
    applications have boosted up the popularity of “smart things” connected to the
    Internet, and the networks created with them. In this way, the traditional WSNs
    have been updated to follow an IP protocol to apply all the benefits that it entails.
    The new paradigm, namely cloud computing, has been added to improve and provide
    more advantages over the IoT [30]. The low bandwidth lacks between the producer
    (smart objects) and consumer parts (cloud server) and the improved performance
    at both computing and consumer of smart objects, has led to a new paradigm called
    edge computing. The main feature of edge computing is that data can be processed
    locally in smart devices, rather than being sent to the cloud for being processed.
    The edge computing essentially means that instead of staying and working from
    a centralized cloud, edge nodes work at the ends of the networks. Edge computing
    puts some of the transactions and resources on the edge of the cloud; instead
    of establishing channels for storage and use in the cloud, it reduces the need
    for bandwidth by not sending every bit of information through channels to the
    cloud and instead adds it in specific access points. By using this type of distributed
    strategy, we can reduce costs and increase efficiency and reduce bandwidth consumption.
    Edge computing arose from the need to address three issues: 1) being able to act
    in real-time with the incoming data; 2) working within the limits of available
    bandwidth; and 3) distributing the computing between the nodes, to relive the
    centralized server. Edge computing address applications and services that do not
    fit the paradigm of the cloud, such as applications that require very low latency
    and being predictable; geospatial distributed applications; fast mobile applications;
    distributed control systems on a large scale. Fig. 1 details the work-flow for
    connecting sensor nodes to users using a cloud and edge computing infrastructure.
    On the one hand, this figure divides the physical and cyber worlds and the IoT
    part with traditional IT. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is used to pass
    the barrier between the IoT device cloud and the IT cloud [31]. It is responsible
    for the interworking between the GPRS network and Internet. On the other hand,
    the figure shows where the edge computing is located. The results offered by the
    edge computing can be sent to the cloud or directly to the clients without using
    any cloud infrastructure. Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download

    and IT, that it is divided between the physical and cyber world. 2.2. Open-hardware
    to make smart objects Nowadays, the open movement has gained attention [32]. Traditionally,
    this idea was applied with more acceptance over source code and provoked the open-source
    movement. More recently, the same idea has been applied to the hardware (open-hardware).
    This situation has permitted to offer complete open systems, where both source
    and hardware are open. The users can contribute to improve the system and propose
    improvements. One of these improvements is the ability to offer more interoperability
    between components because they can be adapted for each usage. In this way, it
    reduces compatibility issues. This advantage can establish a standard IoT approach.
    In this work, we apply different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) standards
    to communicate with each IoT device; these standards will be explained in following
    paragraphs. Another advantage is the low cost of these devices compared with commercial
    solutions. As concluded by [33], open initiatives are cheaper, but they have also
    shown that open hardware is more powerful and has better performance than commercial
    solutions. Also, the same work demonstrates that the open hardware project can
    be considered reliable. Currently, there are several different alternatives regarding
    the micro-controller based platform, and the most remarkable platforms are Arduino2,
    Raspberry Pi3, BeagleBone4 or MSP430 Launchpad5 . All these platforms can be expanded
    easily, and used for other applications. Using these platforms different applications
    have been developed thanks to the acceptance of the IoT movement above described.
    2.3. GIS role in smart agriculture As commented in the Section 1, one way to address
    these issues and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production
    is by using ICT to make farms more “intelligent” and more connected through the
    so-called “precision agriculture” also known as “smart agriculture”. Nowadays,
    there is a high quantity of proprietary IT solutions to help farmers manage their
    farms more effectively [34]. More advanced systems track geospatial zones, weather
    patterns and perform expert predictions [35]. These kinds of systems are called
    Farm Management Information Systems [36], and focus on specific tasks and use
    their specifications to implement the functionality provided. Currently, this
    field is slowly moving to use the Internet and is starting to use some of the
    networking solutions to improve what they offer to the end users. However, it
    is widely accepted that the Internet faces some shortcomings, especially in handling
    vast numbers of networked devices (IoT) or stakeholders. Moreover, there is still
    no standardized solution to enable cohesive and straightforward interoperability
    among services and stakeholders. To solve this issue, we look at GIScience. It
    can offer an excellent opportunity to standardize the ways of connecting different
    “things”, offering an interoperable connection; and it should help to deploy the
    new smart cities. GIScience can be defined as “the discipline that uses GIS as
    tools to understand the world” [37]. It can contribute by offering a crucial essential
    component for the IoT movement, which is interoperability using the use of standards.
    The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)6 is a non-profit international organization
    which develops open standards for the global geospatial community. OGC defines
    standards in a wide variety of domains including environment, defense, health,
    agriculture, meteorology, sustainable development, and smart cities. The OGC has
    standardized Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) as a set of specifications related to
    sensors, sensor data models, and sensor web services that will enable sensors
    to be accessible and controllable via the web [38]. It is composed of a set of
    standards; the most popular are: Observations and Measurements (O&M), SensorML,
    Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Transducer Model Language (TransducerML), Sensor
    Planning Service (SPS), Sensor Alert Service (SAS) or Web Notification Service
    (WNS). Another proposal is OGC SensorThings API7 . It is a new candidate standard
    that provides open access built on web protocols, based on the current SWE standard
    and following the architectural REST style. The aim is to provide a standardized
    a way to expose the IoT world to the real world, where things have limited resources.
    3. SEnviro platform This section presents the sensorized platform used in a smart
    agricultural context. As commented in the above sections, the platform Sense Our
    Environment (SEnviro) [39] follows the IoT and Web of Things (WoT) [40] paradigms
    by means of a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software, energetically efficient
    and autonomous and interoperable solution. The SEnviro platform uses the IP protocol
    to establish the connection. With these features, it can be considered that each
    SEnviro Thing is a smart object. A network is formed by joining several SEnviro
    Things. This platform makes use of standards when publishing data. It guarantees
    the interoperability of the services provided by the platform. Another important
    feature of this platform is that it is energetically efficient and autonomous
    through a battery cell, which is charged with the energy provided by a solar panel
    attached to it. To save as much energy as possible, we are using a sleep mode,
    in which during this period the micro-controller and connectivity module consume
    as little as possible. 3.1. How is SEnviro made of? At the hardware level, the
    sensorized platform has been designed to be a node acting as a smart object, which
    provides measures of environmental variables. Each SEnviro Thing is composed of
    different components, which are organized into four groups depending on their
    function: Core, Sensors, Power Supply and Communication. At the same time, the
    Core is formed by four parts: Micro-controller, Connectors, Clock, and Memory.
    For this work, we developed an enhanced SEnviro using the LinkIt One development
    board. The LinkIt ONE board is an open source, high performance, Arduino footprint
    board for prototyping IoT devices. The board is based around a powerful ARM7 EJ-S
    processor but has onboard GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth BR/EDR/BLE, GPS, Audio codec,
    and SD card connector. Pin-out similar to Arduino boards, including Digital I/O,
    Analog I/O, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART and power supply, compatible with Grove 4-pin
    interface. In Section 5, we detail all components used to develop the SEnviro
    node for monitoring vineyards. 3.2. How does SEnviro work? At an operational level,
    SEnviro Thing can change its behaviour, updating the information about what sensor
    is active and the frequency at which measures are taken. The SEnviro Thing''s
    behaviour has two stages, initial and repetitive periodic. In the initial stage,
    a set of procedures are executed when it is initiated, for instance, one procedure
    could initialize the clock using the current time. The repetitive periodic stage
    defines the procedures that are repeated during the SEnviro Thing''s life cycle
    before going to sleep. Fig. 4 shows the design of the complete infrastructure
    with all of the system''s components, and describes each of them in different
    layers. If we analyze SEnviro from a GIS context and specify what is happening
    in each of its layers, we obtain Fig. 2, which we are going to detail below. In
    the content layer, there are different SEnviro Things to cover an area to measure
    the phenomena by the included sensors in each sensorized platform. In this figure,
    we can see the two functionalities mentioned above. Download : Download high-res
    image (253KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. General overview about
    the SEnviro work-flow following three layers architecture. As detailed in [39],
    different observations are periodically taken from the installed sensors to monitor
    the environment. When the SEnviro Thing takes a new observation, it invokes the
    Sensor Data Management (SDM) module. This component is implemented as a RESTful
    web service. The SDM module is responsible for publishing observations in different
    services that we want to offer, such as SensorThings API, SOS or others. Thus,
    it offers the same content using different interfaces; depending on the context
    it may be more or less appropriate. Different adapters for each of these services
    are offered. If we want to support new services/standards, we only need to add
    a new adapter for the service. We use the adapter software pattern to implement
    this feature. The service layer offers the services described above. One of the
    objectives of the SEnviro platform is to offer a standard service, to provide
    connectivity in an interoperable way. To meet this challenge, a candidate OGC
    standard, SensorThings API, has been used to offer an interoperable service to
    access the SEnviro platform. The most remarkable thing about this standard is
    that it breaks away from all “standard topics” [41] and offers access to restrictive
    devices, such as smartphones. Also, it offers the SOS interface to increase the
    interoperability, because this standard is widely used [42]. Finally, a lightweight
    RestFul service is created to connect this service in a more agile way [43]. The
    last layer, the application layer has been designed for different clients, mobile,
    web-based or desktop. The SEnviro Thing can adapt its behavior, updating the information
    about which sensor is active and the frequency at which measurements are taken.
    At regular intervals, the platform requests a new behavior to a server using a
    RestFul service. Then, the SEnviro Thing will get a new behavior following the
    new configuration received. The sensorized platform sends the taken observations
    to a server. A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this integration.
    Different operations are available to collect the observations measured. When
    one SEnviro Thing takes a new observation it invokes these operations to send
    data to the server using SDM module. When the SDM receives a new observation,
    it connects with the different adapters to send the data for each available service.
    To accomplish this objective, we have followed previous work [43], [39] to connect
    with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate standard SensorThings
    API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors access using RestFul
    interface used in [43]. To offer all these interfaces, we provide different adapters
    to publish the sensor data in different services or databases. To offer a SensorThings
    interface, we use an external server to test this API, which is offered by the
    SensorThings API candidate proposal. For SOS, the 52° North implementation (SOS
    version 2.0) is used. In this case, the server is deployed using an Apache Tomcat
    server and sensor data are stored in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database8 following
    the documented standard installation guides. Finally, for the last interface,
    a Lightweight RestFul service is implemented using JAX-RS9, Jersey 10 and one
    MongoDB database11 is used to store the observations. 4. Goidanich model to detect
    downy mildew disease Downy mildew is a fungal disease caused by the plasmopara
    viticola oomycete. It is one of the worst diseases of vine cultivation under specific
    weather conditions. Downy mildew is the most studied disease, as it produces critical
    economic losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries [44]. Downy mildew
    is the result of the presence of a fungus in the green elements of the vines,
    and its life cycle is well established [44]. Its biological cycle is developed
    in four phases: contamination, incubation, and sporulation and propagation phase.
    • Contamination phase: in spring, the oospores reach maturity and germinate as
    zoospores. These may be transported by rain and wind, reaching the vine green
    parts and colonizing them. The needed conditions for contamination are: an air
    temperature around 10 °C, a young plant of at least 10 cm, and a rain rate of
    at least 10 mm/day. • Incubation phase: it takes from 4 to 21 days, depending
    on the temperatures and relative humidity. • Sporulation phase: during this step,
    the fungus is propagated along the vine. • Propagation phase: dissemination to
    nearby plants with the help of rebounding raindrops and wind. The optimal condition
    for ambient temperature is between 20 and 25 °C, with the help of rain during
    the night. There are some models with more complexity and better precision than
    Goldanich [45] such as MILVIT [46], [47]. Some other works simulate only a particular
    phase of the epidemic cycle [48], [49]. Moreover, some other works simulate only
    the first date of primary infection followed by the second cycle with quantitative
    outputs [50], [51]. More recently, new models are presented which use exploratory
    simulations based on newly available computing power [52]. Our work, unlike the
    ones found in the bibliography, is the pioneer in using devices of IoT for monitoring
    this kind of models. Although Goldanich''s model has been improved over time,
    it is an ideal candidate for testing our platform. As a future work, we intend
    to use other more complete models to improve the predictions of this type of disease.
    The Goidanich model is used to follow the evolution of the downy mildew fungus
    [16]. It takes into account three different phenomena: relative humidity, temperature,
    and rainfall. The model starts when a traditional method is reached, the “rule
    of the three ten”, which predicts that primary infections will occur once the
    average temperature has exceeded 10 degrees, the sprouting exceed 10 cm and on
    a day when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall. This rule, though simple, gives
    a rough idea of when to start looking for these primary infections. To follow
    the evolution of the fungus, it is necessary to know the average temperature (Tm),
    the average relative humidity (Hm) and daily rainfall. Goidanich presents a daily
    table (Table 1) in which, for each temperature, the daily growth of the fungus
    is set according to whether the Hm is high or low. The author defines each Tm
    in two columns, one when the Hm is lower than 75% and the other when it is higher
    than 75%, providing, therefore, two numerical values of daily development for
    each case. Table 1. Daily cumulative percentage of downy mildew incubation. Tm(C)

    records 10 or more mm of rain, starting from the next day, the estimation of the
    daily growth is recorded, and the model is calculated by adding every day until
    reaching the value of 100. At this moment, the theoretical incubation period ends,
    and the fungus contamination is evident due to the appearance of stains of oil
    and the asexual fruiting. The model works in that if the sum of the daily development
    accumulated is over 70%, the risk is high, so treatment is needed as soon as possible.
    If a fungicide product is applied, the development of the fungus restarts and
    remains in suspension for a certain number of days, or until the product has been
    washed away by rain. 5. Case study: SEnviro for agriculture This section details
    how we have developed the sensorized platform in a smart agricultural context.
    5.1. Building a SEnviro Thing for Smart Agriculture For this work, we have developed
    a new version of the sensorized platform presented in [39]. For the current case
    study, we only need three different phenomenon sensors, such as temperature, humidity
    sensor and rain gauge (Fig. 3). Also, for this case, the new sensorized platform
    uses a GPRS connection to offer easy installation and wireless connection in the
    field. The LinkIt One board offers an integrated GPRS module. Table 2 shows a
    general description. Fig. 3 shows a SEnviro Thing assembled with all components

    2200 mAh12 that supplies an output voltage of 3.7 V and is charged with the power
    generated with a 3W solar panel13 that supplies an output voltage of 5.2 V. Those
    two elements and the microcontroller are attached to a board (Lipo Rider V1.114)
    that handles the power ow between the various components. Finally, to protect
    all parts of the SEnviro Thing, two boxes have been used. A waterproof box15 to
    protect the Core, Communication and Power supply and a pagoda box to protect the
    sensors. 5.2. Applying Goidanich model This section describes the behavior that
    follows the developed SEnviro node for monitoring the downy mildew. The SEnviro
    has two different objectives: 1) to take and send observations at a defined rate,
    which by default is every ten minutes. 2) to calculate the Goidanich model, and
    if an alert state happens, the SEnviro node will send an alert via SMS. The Fig.

    components of the infrastructure and the sequence diagram of an exemplary usage
    to send SEnviro''s observations; on bottom) it gives a sequence diagram of an
    alarm. The first functionality was explained in [39], but in this work, some changes
    have been introduced. The first functionality has been the connectivity used.
    We have selected GPRS connectivity due to lack of other connectivity in the context
    in which it is experienced. The sensorized platform sends the observations to
    a server (Section 3). A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this
    integration. Different operations are available to collect the observations measured.
    When one SEnviro Thing catches a new observation, it invokes these operations
    and sends the data to the server using the SDM module. When the SDM receives a
    new observation, it connects with the different adapters to send the data for
    each service available. To accomplish this objective, we have followed our previous
    work [43], [39] to connect with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate
    standard SensorThings API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors
    access using RestFul interface used in [43]. To complete the SEnviro Thing integration,
    we proposed a SEnviro application to access sensor data provided by each SEnviro
    Thing. The SEnviro APP is a web-application in charge of integrating the sensor
    data provided by the installed SEnviro Things. Furthermore, the application is
    built using the mobile-first approach. In this way, it can be easily tested on
    a mobile device. The second functionality, which is of high importance for this
    work, is the possibility to apply the Goidanich model in each SEnviro node. We
    follow the fog computing paradigm to distribute the computation between the devices,
    in this case, SEnviro nodes. To calculate the Goidanich model, we need to know
    the temperature and humidity averages per day and the amount of rainfall accumulated.
    Each platform will have the capability to execute a method as depicted in Fig.
    5. The Pseudocode 1 shows how each SEnviro Thing can calculate the Goidanich model.

    step is to accumulate the rain gauge. When it starts to rain, the algorithm will
    calculate the rain quantitative uninterruptedly while it is raining. The accumulative
    value will be reset when in one-day rainfall has been recorded. When the accumulative
    rainfall exceeds 10 mm, the SEnviro starts to calculate the temperature and humidity
    means. To offer these means, we will add up all of the observations taken in one
    day and divide them by the number of observations. These means will be used to
    determine the percentage of downy mildew incubation, and the selected value will
    be accumulated. When this value reaches 100, an alarm will be sent to the farmer
    to inform him/her about the downy mildew incubation level, and the specialized
    treatment can begin. We have selected SMS-based services as the way to connect
    with the farmers. It is due to the high penetration of mobile phones used by the
    stakeholders. Also, using SMS notifications, we can guarantee that the notification
    will arrive at the farmer. Other mobile technologies that use Internet connection
    do not guarantee the notification delivery, because the receiver needs permanent
    Inter-net connection. It involves farmers having a smartphone with an Internet
    connection data plan that will also receive the alarm. It is important to remark
    the potential of the developed SEnviro node. Although this subsection has described
    the behavior that it followed for a particular disease, its development could
    be modified to follow other models using the meteorological data collected by
    the node. Therefore, we consider that the SEnviro node could also be useful for
    detecting different diseases in vineyards or other crops. 5.3. Results In a first
    phase, the platform has been tested in a lab environment. It was working correctly
    without huge losses. The sensors obtained measurements between predictable values.
    The rain gauge has also been tested with rain recreation, and it was working correctly.
    These tests were carried out both indoors and outdoors. In a second phase, we
    have been deployed within a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés
    (Castelló, Spain). The parcel has a 23633.4 m2. Fig. 6 shows the location of each
    SEnviro Thing. A SEnviro node was deployed in this vineyard parcel during May
    2016 (Fig. 7), the month when downy mildew can begin to arise at the chosen location.
    As mentioned, this platform is capable of measuring three different phenomena
    which are temperature, humidity and the amount of rainfall that are all involved
    in the Goidanich''s model. During this month, observations were taken every 10
    minutes and were sent to the central server. Each platform can calculate the temperature
    and minimum humidity, in addition to calculating cumulative rainfall every day.

    the platform registered correct observations. During this period, the rain gauge
    did not reach 10mm to activate the alert, so our system does not detect downy
    mildew. During the 30 days that is was running almost all observations (96,9%
    successful deliveries) have been measured and sent in real-time although there
    were some that were undetected due to the loss of the signal in the area. These
    lost observations were sent in following deliveries. 6. A comparative between
    some similar works In the literature, some approaches are similar to our proposal.
    The following items describe the works that have been analyzed. All of them talk
    about IoT in the smart agriculture context, more concretely on monitoring vineyards.
    • In [53], the authors propose a WSN where each node takes images from the field
    and internally uses image processing techniques to detect any unusual status in
    the leaves. • The paper [54] presents a smart embedded system that will aid vineyards
    and which is cost-effective and flexible. They monitor ambient temperature and
    humidity and send an SMS with the values. • Authors in [55] do not describe a
    single platform, they show a variety of sensor network configurations and applications
    that can address different priorities in the vineyard. • Authors in [56] present
    the results from an operational sensor network. The network is based on the Berkeley
    mote (Mica II mote). The basic sensor board is equipped with a temperature sensor.
    The network consisted of sixty-five motes distributed in a grid-like pattern ten
    to twenty meters apart covering about two acres. • Authors in [57] present a general
    sensor network designed to connect agriculture to the IoT. A customized sensor
    node and developed the application for agriculture on top of TinyOS 2.x are detailed.
    A common access interface of the sensor networks for agricultural applications
    was created to enable further integration of the sensor networks on the IoT. •
    A sensor network built using TelosB platforms is presented in [58]. They show
    the experience of maturated during the design and deployment of a prototypal WSN-based
    system for monitoring the productive cycle of high-quality wine in a Sicilian
    winery. They propose two networks, one for the vineyard, and another for the wine
    cellar. The objective is to provide some of the basic functionalities that may
    be extended to obtain complete product traceability, from the grapes to the bottle.
    To compare the formerly reviewed works, Table 3 shows a comparison between the
    detailed works. The following features to characterize each one have been proposed:
    • Platform: it refers to the microcontroller model that the system uses. • Real-Time:
    it indicates if the system works in real-time. Possible values: Yes/No. • Connection:
    it refers to the wireless connections available for the system. Possible values:
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, others. • Phenomena: it refers to the phenomena that the
    system can measure. Possible values: Temp., Hum., Dust, Bar., Noise, others. •
    IoT-WoT: it indicates if the system follows the IoT and WoT paradigms. Possible
    values: Yes/No. • Analyze: it shows if the system offers a RESTFul interface.
    Possible values: Yes/No. • Client: it indicates if the system provides a client
    for visualizing the sensors and observations. Possible values: Yes (what kind)
    /No. • OGC standards: it shows if the system offers OGC standards. Possible values:
    Yes (what kind) /No. Table 3. Comparison between different sensorized platforms.

    works and our work using the characteristics listed at the beginning of this section,
    and the results are shown in Table 3. As indicated, most of the analyzed works
    use different platforms to build the different nodes. In our case, we use LinkIt
    ONE, because it has different ways to connect, GPRS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It also
    includes useful operations to use the different features. Like some other works
    analyzed, our work offers sensor data in real-time. It is possible because our
    SEnviro node, to monitor vineyards, is provided with GPRS connection to the Internet.
    SEnviro, as we show in [39], it can include a huge variety of phenomena. For this
    proof of concept, to detect downy mildew disease, we adopt the nodes to offer
    only three phenomena: temperature, humidity and rain gauge. Only three analyzed
    projects [56], [57], [58] follow the IoT and WoT paradigms. SEnviro follows these
    paradigms and offers a RESTFul interface. Finally, our project aims to be interoperable,
    and for this purpose, an OGC standard has been chosen, such as the OGC SensorThings
    API. If you look at the works that apply some analysis over the observations from
    the sensors, only two works, apart from SEnviro, apply some analysis to increase
    the value of the observations and offer decision-making models. Our work, as we
    detailed in the previous work [39], provides a client to these paradigms and offers
    a RESTful interface using the OGC SensorThings API. 7. Conclusions The primary
    concern of this work is to apply the new improvements in the ICT area, within
    the smart agriculture context. In this way, the applied model to detect the suitable
    moment to treat downy mildew disease can help the farmer in different ways. The
    first improvement is the reduction of costs of chemical products. The proposed
    support system detects the best moment to apply the downy mildew control treatments,
    which are only applied when they are strictly necessary. At the same time, it
    reduces the chemicals in the soil. It redounds in less external elements in the
    environment, improving the ecological footprint of the crop. Also, it reduces
    costs concerning person-hours; each treatment that is not needed represents some
    working hours that could be used for other tasks. Consequently, the farmer does
    not need to visit the vineyards to know the status. Our work applied a sensorized
    platform called SEnviro detailed in [39], whose objective was to monitor vineyards.
    For this purpose, we have designed a new version of the sensorized platform to
    measure different phenomena to provide follow up models to detect the best moment
    to treat downy mildew. To achieve this, we propose an improved version of the
    SEnviro platform that follows different computer science paradigms, such as IoT
    or edge computing. In this way, our platform can process and apply short algorithms
    to compute the information at the same moment when the data are collected. The
    objective of the work is not to evaluate or validate the Goldanich model since
    there are different works in the bibliography related to that. Our work only shows
    a single experimentation to test the presented IoT platform. It has offered good
    results during the month that the SEnviro platform has been installed and has
    correctly reported the observations to the central server, the platform had some
    isolated losses caused by coverage problems to send the observation in real-time.
    Temperatures and humidities average for the monitoring of the Goidanich model
    have also been calculated. As future work, new fungal disease models in the field
    of viticulture could be included, such as Powdery mildew, Black rot or Botrytis.
    All of these diseases are based on meteorological phenomena, and they are included
    in the SEnviro node. New kinds of crop could be supported if the disease models
    are based on these meteorological phenomena. Support other crops with other phenomena
    require to add these sensors, in this case, more efforts are needed. Acknowledgments

  description: 'It is needed to solve the problems such as relatively low input-output
    ratio and environmental pollution for Chinese agriculture, with the large amount
    of agricultural production and consumption. In the background of changing international
    situation and frequent natural disasters, transforming traditional agricultural
    production methods in China is an urgent. Driven by emerging technologies such
    as artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud platform, automatic control,
    and new generation communication and so on, precision agriculture came out and
    was undoubtedly an effective way. Precision agriculture has become a common choice
    for developing sustainable and high-yield agriculture around the world. In order
    to obtain the development orientation of precision agriculture and successful
    practices in the world, this paper reviews the studies on precision agriculture
    developing status. The aim of this paper is to refine the experiences of precision
    agriculture developing in the main developed countries and regions and take a
    look at the precision agriculture development in China. Adopting the method of
    systematic literature analyzing and summary, Section 1 studies the development
    status of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions, such
    as America, Japan, European Union and Israel. The idea of precision agriculture
    was first proposed in America. Until today, America has developed mature precision
    agriculture system, which benefits from the highly developed technologies. Considering
    the serious contradiction between large population and less farmland, during 1970s,
    Japan took measures of consolidating farmland on a large scale and building farmland
    infrastructure and so on to improve the agricultural production conditions. The
    agricultural community was also formed to operate collaboratively the agricultural
    production. The development of precision agriculture in European Union is driving
    by digital technologies. The water-saving agriculture represented by drip-irrigation
    and sprinkler-irrigation has made remarkable results in Israel. The development
    experiences of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions
    enlighten us that: 1) the leading by government is the key; 2) the informatization
    construction is the foundation; 3) the advanced technology is the core; 4) the
    cultivation of new type of farmers is the guarantee. Section 2 analyzed the basements
    and weaknesses for developing precision agriculture in China. The weaknesses are
    the emphasis in this section. First, the farmland in China is scattered and the
    infrastructure is not perfect. Taking the informatization perspective, even though
    number of agriculture related information systems exist, the data and information
    are not interoperable between these systems. Second, at the present stage, we
    cannot acquire the temporal and spatial continuous agricultural information due
    to the rarity domestic satellite data and ground sensors for agriculture monitoring.
    Third, automatic variable operating system and equipment are lacking since the
    technology integration of information technology, communication and agricultural
    machine has not been achieved. Fourth, insufficient high-quality agricultural
    talents. Facing these weakness and Chinese conditions, Section 3 provided five
    suggestions to develop precision agriculture in China. Firstly, our government
    should overall plan and give guarantee in police making, infrastructure construction
    and financial support, etc. Secondly, we should improve the agricultural production
    condition through expanding moderately the operating scale of farmland and constructing
    the field infrastructure net and the national agricultural information platform.
    Thirdly, the key technology research, such as the information retrieval using
    remote sensing and technology integration of communication, automatic controlling,
    spatial information and smart machinery must be focused. Fourthly, the new type
    of personnel in agricultural field can be cultivated. Fifthly, pilot demonstration
    can be carried out according to the regional difference.'

  description: 'Single-plant growth monitoring aids precision agricultural decision-making
    to reduce the costs related to pesticides, fertilizers, and labor. This study
    integrated visible/multi-spectral UAV imagery with two deep learning methods,
    object detection and semantic segmentation, to obtain a visualized map that could
    assist in precise field monitoring and management for broccoli cultivation. For
    plant detection, feature extraction was conducted using multiscale dilated convolution,
    which enabled the effective detection of broccoli in images taken under different
    photographic conditions and resolutions. Two crops of broccoli (cultivar: Broccoli
    No. 42) were planted in 2020 at Taichung Agricultural Research and Extension Station,
    in which the first crop was treated as the training data. The detection of individual
    broccoli plants was processed using a feature extraction architecture of the AlexNet-Like
    backend at the SSD frontend, where the input scale of the detector complies with
    the original SSD architecture. For the model test on the second crop, the recall
    and precision were 98.58% and 99.73%, respectively, after histogram matching based
    on the first crop images. Moreover, the proposed approach was applied to a real
    farming field to verify its robustness across different conditions, and achieved
    a recall of 61.13% using dilated convolution. This study also generated a visualized
    growth map on a single-plant basis, which allows operators to detect growth situations,
    such as uneven irrigation or fertilization and necrosis and apoptosis, to greatly
    enhance the viability of precision agriculture in the calculation of unit yield
    and intragroup differences for a regime. The proposed approach can be used to
    determine the optimal amount of fertilization and observe the size of broccoli
    heads to determine the optimal harvest time. Expectedly, the method may also be
    applied to the monitoring and management of other crops to improve the efficiency
    and reduce the labor demand for precision agriculture.'

    Abstract Single-plant growth monitoring aids precision agricultural decision-making
    to reduce the costs related to pesticides, fertilizers, and labor. This study
    integrated visible/multi-spectral UAV imagery with two deep learning methods,
    object detection and semantic segmentation, to obtain a visualized map that could
    assist in precise field monitoring and management for broccoli cultivation. For
    plant detection, feature extraction was conducted using multiscale dilated convolution,
    which enabled the effective detection of broccoli in images taken under different
    photographic conditions and resolutions. Two crops of broccoli (cultivar: Broccoli
    No. 42) were planted in 2020 at Taichung Agricultural Research and Extension Station,
    in which the first crop was treated as the training data. The detection of individual
    broccoli plants was processed using a feature extraction architecture of the AlexNet-Like
    backend at the SSD frontend, where the input scale of the detector complies with
    the original SSD architecture. For the model test on the second crop, the recall
    and precision were 98.58% and 99.73%, respectively, after histogram matching based
    on the first crop images. Moreover, the proposed approach was applied to a real
    farming field to verify its robustness across different conditions, and achieved
    a recall of 61.13% using dilated convolution. This study also generated a visualized
    growth map on a single-plant basis, which allows operators to detect growth situations,
    such as uneven irrigation or fertilization and necrosis and apoptosis, to greatly
    enhance the viability of precision agriculture in the calculation of unit yield
    and intragroup differences for a regime. The proposed approach can be used to
    determine the optimal amount of fertilization and observe the size of broccoli
    heads to determine the optimal harvest time. Expectedly, the method may also be
    applied to the monitoring and management of other crops to improve the efficiency
    and reduce the labor demand for precision agriculture. Previous article in issue

    basis 1. Introduction Subtropics experience warm and pluvial climate, which is
    conducive to crop growth, but also contributes to the growth of pests and crop
    diseases. In Taiwan, the increasing incidence of extreme weather events attributable
    to climate change, such as the frequent occurrence of typhoons and heavy rainfall,
    has increased the challenges in agricultural production. Moreover, population
    aging and low birth rate, which are particularly observed to a greater extent
    in rural areas, have caused a shortage in farming labor, which further aggravates
    the challenges in the farming industry (Haung, 2013). Therefore, to counter the
    negative impact on agricultural production, smart farming technology that enables
    precise decision-making in agricultural management must be introduced. Among the
    crops produced in Taiwan, broccoli is a vegetable rich in vitamin C and prevents
    cancer (Finley et al., 2000). With the advances in processing technologies, such
    as vegetable freezing and dehydration, the market for broccoli has expanded, causing
    an increase in the price and farms of broccoli. Moreover, broccoli has been recognized
    as a vegetable with high economic value and potential. Fertilization is a key
    factor in broccoli production (Yoldas et al., 2008). Farmers tend to overfertilize
    their farms to increase production; however, this can affect the appearance and
    quality of broccoli, and thereby, human health and soil condition (Savci, 2012).
    The cultivation and harvesting of broccoli require professional skills because
    broccoli is sensitive to environmental conditions. The shortage of labor and the
    conventional practice of using massive amounts of fertilizers and chemicals makes
    the management of broccoli fields cumbersome in terms of both time and money.
    Therefore, to fulfill the goals of saving labor and cost, obtaining optimal production,
    and maintaining environmental sustainability, a smart field monitoring method
    is required to assist in the decision-making regarding fertilizer and chemical
    use in broccoli fields. Remote sensing technology has been extensively applied
    in agriculture (Mulla, 2013). In particular, the application of unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) to acquire high-resolution images has become a new trend in precision
    farming owing to its high efficiency and low cost (Candiago et al., 2015). Compared
    with satellite imagery, which is subject to the satellite’s repeat cycle, and
    aerial photography, which is costly, UAV imagery presents the advantages of high
    speed, convenience, and low cost, which makes it ideal for the short-term monitoring
    of plant growth. Because the low flight height of UAVs helps obtain images of
    objects on the scale of millimeters, UAV imagery has been successfully used in
    crop classification, weed detection, and growth monitoring, indicating its feasibility
    for use in precision farming (Mamo et al., 2003). Bah et al. (2017) integrated
    UAV imagery with Hough transform and simple linear iterative clustering for the
    detection of weeds in corn fields and achieved an accuracy of over 90% and an
    overdetection rate of <2%. Agüera et al. (2012) compared the sunflower nitrogen
    content estimated using UAV images to that measured on the ground and integrated
    the data with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for crop recognition,
    and achieved a producer and user accuracy close to 98%. NDVI was also calculated
    to estimate the nitrogen content of corn based on a low-cost color-infrared airborne
    system, and resulted in R2 of 0.7 and RRMSE < 25% in external validation (Corti
    et al., 2019). Yang et al. (2017) applied the digital surface model and texture
    information of visible light UAV images to a decision tree algorithm and achieved
    an overall accuracy of 96.17% for rice lodging identification. Comba et al. (2020)
    predicted the leaf area index of the vineyards by using a 3D point cloud generated
    from UAV-based multi-spectral imagery with R2 of 0.82. UAV images were also integrated
    with Structure from Motion (SfM) to estimate the height and crown diameter of
    coffee trees with a correlation of 87% and 95%, respectively (dos Santos et al.,
    2020). Vegetation indices based on drone multi-spectral images were calculated
    to estimate plant density through empirical regression models with a high prediction
    accuracy for barley and wheat with R2 > 0.91 and MAE < 28 plants (Wilke et al.,
    2021). Green coverage in drone imagery was estimated by SVM classification based
    on RGB composites, and achieved R2 ranging from 0.88 to 0.95 and MAE ranging from
    1.94 to 2.97% (Wang et al., 2022). With the advances in deep learning (DL) technology,
    convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively used in image recognition.
    Notably, the integration of CNNs with high-resolution UAV images has been applied
    to numerous aspects of large-scale agriculture, such as disease detection (Kerkech
    et al., 2018), weed mapping (Huang et al., 2018), and large-area rice lodging
    identification (Yang et al., 2020b, Yang et al., 2020c). For classifying infected
    maize leaves in drone images, various convolutional neural network architectures,
    including VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3 and MobileNetV2, were compared and got that
    both InceptionV3 and MobileNetV2 both achieved 100% accuracy (Ishengoma et al.,
    2021). This approach overcomes the challenges of conventional algorithms, which
    are highly demanding in terms of hardware resources and time. This integrated
    approach also effectively supersedes the labor-intensive conventional field management
    approach. Moreover, compared with naked-eye detection and conventional image classification,
    the DL-based approach yields higher accuracy (Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
    Object detection and semantic segmentation are two widely applied methods in the
    field of DL. Specifically, object detection is performed on a regression/classification-based
    framework (Liu et al., 2016, Redmon and Farhadi, 2018) or a region proposal-based
    framework (Girshick, 2015, Girshick et al., 2014, Ren et al., 2017), wherein bounding
    boxes are generated around a target object and the class and location data of
    a said object are exported (Forsyth, 2014) for further tracking, counting, and
    recognition. This approach has been extensively applied in face recognition (Yu
    et al., 2016), pedestrian detection (Xu et al., 2017), and driver assistance systems
    (Lin et al., 2020). This study combined UAVs and DL technology for broccoli growth
    monitoring. In this approach, an object detection network and a geographic information
    system were used for plant positioning and a small-scale semantic segmentation
    model was subsequently used to filter out background information for the precise
    calculation of VIs and canopy coverage (CC). The traits of broccoli growth, plant
    positioning, and VI results were integrated and visualized on a distribution map
    of healthy plants. Distribution maps enable the comparison of plants treated with
    different amounts of fertilizers by means of their spectral differences that reflect
    the uneven irrigation and fertilization in the fields. Growth monitoring of individual
    broccoli plants is conducive to efficient decision-making related to field management.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Planning for the tested fields In this study, UAVs
    were used to obtain images of two crops of broccoli (cultivar: Broccoli No. 42)
    in 2020 in the Taichung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station (TDARES).
    The specific location of the fields is presented in Fig. 1. The first crop accounted
    for a field area of 1500 m2 and was treated with different amounts of potash-based
    or nitrogen-based fertilizers (K-treatment and N-treatment, respectively). Table
    1 presents the four levels of fertilizers used. When K-treatment was applied,
    N2 treatment was applied concurrently as equivalent. Conversely, when an N-treatment
    was applied, K2 treatment was applied concurrently as an equivalent. For both
    K-treatment and N-treatment, 10 g/m2 of phosphate fertilizer was added as an equivalent.
    Nitrogen was identified as the main fertilizer for the first broccoli crop. The
    second crop was distributed over a field area totaling 1650 m2, and four concentrations
    of nitrogen fertilizers were processed in triplicate. Fig. 2 presents the layout
    of fields for the two crops. In each field, 45% of the total amount of fertilizer
    was applied on Day 0 as basal dressing, and 15%, 15%, and 25% were used on the
    10th, 25th, and 35th days, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (268KB)

    various UAVs, visible orthomosaic images and multi-spectral orthomosaic images
    of the first crop were obtained, respectively, using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro (DJI,
    Shenzhen, China) and a DJI M200 installed with a RedEdge-M (MicaSense, Seattle,
    WA, USA). The images for the second crop were obtained using a Zenmuse X7 (DJI,
    Shenzhen, China) and an Altum (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA), respectively, both
    mounted on a DJI M210 RTK. Specifications of the cameras are listed in Table 2.

    GSD = Ground sampling distance; FOV = Field of view. To adapt to the difference
    in the camera resolutions, the UAVs maintained a flight height of 20 m for the
    first crop and 30 m for the second crop, thus keeping the ground sampling distance
    (GSD) of the visible orthomosaic images and multi-spectral orthomosaic images
    at approximately 5 and 14 mm, respectively. Four ground control points were established
    for each crop, and their coordinates were determined using an S82 RTK surveying
    system (South GNSS, Guangzhou, PRC) and the virtual base station (e-GNSS) obtained
    from Taiwan’s National Land Surveying and Mapping Center. The coordinates, with
    a mean measurement error of < ±8 mm, served as the basis for georeferencing in
    modeling UAV images processed on Agisoft Metashape (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg,
    Russia) (Yang et al., 2020a). One session of visible orthomosaic image acquisition
    and nine sessions of multi-spectral orthomosaic image acquisition were conducted
    for both crops, with the visible images being used for plant positioning and the
    multi-spectral mages for calculating VIs and CC. Table 3 presents the parameters
    of the orthomosaic images. The multi-spectral orthomosaic images of the first
    and second crops are presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, respectively. Table 3. Parameters

    different conditions, visible orthomosaic images were obtained from a broccoli
    farming field in Lucao, Chiayi (Fig. 5), which was outside the TDARES. The field
    was approximately 7500 m2 in size, and the images were taken using a DJI Phantom
    4 Pro at a flight height of 40 m and a ground resolution of 8.3 mm. Because the
    BR-8 cultivar and not Broccoli No. 42 was planted at this site, the images obtained
    at this site differed from the training images. Therefore, the applicability of
    the model to other cultivars could be evaluated. Download : Download high-res

    taken in the early morning with suitable sunlight to keep the light source sufficient,
    and the shutter speed was higher than 1/500 s to ensure clear images. At the same
    time, it has a lower sun elevation angle to avoid sun reflections in the images.
    2.3. Training, validation, and testing datasets Fig. 6 presents the experimental
    procedure in the study. Image acquisition with UAVs was followed by numerous steps,
    namely image modeling (visible and multi-spectral), image mosaicing, ground truth
    annotation, and CNN model training and evaluation. Two data sets were established,
    namely, a broccoli positioning data set based on visible orthomosaic images and
    a broccoli segmentation data set based on multi-spectral orthomosaic images. Both
    the data sets were divided into three parts for model training, validation, and
    testing. The broccoli positioning model was used to determine the geographical
    coordinates of each broccoli plant in a field. These coordinates, when applied
    to the multi-spectral orthomosaic images in the broccoli segmentation model, enable
    the precise calculation of spectral responses for each broccoli plant, and the
    results of all plants are then pooled together to form a distribution map of healthy
    plants. Download : Download high-res image (397KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Research flowchart. 2.3.1. Broccoli positioning dataset To evaluate
    the accuracy of the broccoli positioning model at different resolutions and photographic
    settings, the training data were extracted from the visible image of the first
    crop taken on March 4, 2020 (15th day). An area accounting for approximately 20%
    of the crop was extracted from the image and divided into 72 tiles, each tile
    being 512 × 512 pixels in size. The tiles constituted a training set that was
    imported into a graphical image annotation tool, Labellmg, where the bounding
    box coordinates of broccoli plants were exported in the PascalVoc format as the
    ground truth data and divided into training and validation samples at a ratio
    of 4:1 (Lin, 2018). Thus, the final training and validation sets contained 58
    and 14 images, respectively. Additionally, 12 images from other parts of the raw
    image of the first crop formed a test set. Furthermore, the open-source code from
    Afifi and Brown (2019) was used to augment the training and validation sets through
    manipulation of the white balance and brightness of the images, and the sets were
    augmented by 2.5 times according to the recommendation of Lei et al. (2019). Fig.
    7 presents samples of the training set for the broccoli positioning model, including
    images with adjusted white balance and brightness. In the test set, images of
    the second crop taken on November 12, 2020 (22nd day) and those of the Chiayi
    field taken on December 13, 2019 (25th day) were also added, thereby forming three
    subsets. Approximately 10% of the visible images of the two sites were included,
    and each image was divided into tiles of 512 × 512 pixels in size. The precision
    of the model was evaluated by testing the three subsets separately at different
    photographic conditions. As is evident in Fig. 8, images from the three subsets
    exhibited marked differences in tone, brightness, and resolution. Download : Download

    data set consisted of multi-spectral images of the first and second crops. One
    image of the first crop taken on April 5, 2020 (47th day) and two images of the
    second crop, one taken on November 5, 2020 (15th day) and the other on November
    12, 2020 (22nd day), were included. Six tiles, every 512 × 512 pixels in size,
    were arbitrarily included. These samples covered different stages in the lifecycle
    of broccoli. After the ground truth data were compiled, the raw images and corresponding
    ground truth data were further divided into 24 tiles, every 256 × 256 pixels in
    size. These tiles were distributed into a training set, a validation set, and
    a test set at a ratio of 4:1:1. Thus, the training, validation, and test sets
    had 16, 4, and 4 tiles, respectively. 2.4. Broccoli positioning network training
    This study adopted a single-shot detector (SSD) as the architecture for object
    detection (Liu et al., 2016). Specifically, the SSD7 architecture in the open-source
    code published on GitHub by Ferrari (2018) was used. Compared with the original
    SSD architecture (SSD300 in the open-source code), SSD7 has an identical structure
    but includes fewer parameters, which makes it suitable for relatively simple and
    less data-intensive applications, such as that presented herein. Fig. 9 illustrates
    the frontend feature extraction network of SSD7, which is an AlexNet-Like (Krizhevsky
    et al., 2012) network that achieves multiscale feature extraction through a pyramidal
    feature hierarchy formed by continuous convolution layers and pooling layers.
    The extracted multiscale features are subsequently transmitted to a detector for
    the classification and regression of bounding boxes. In the present study, the
    feature extraction architecture was modified for comparison. Following Li et al.,
    2019, Chen et al., 2017, feature extraction was conducted through dilated convolution
    at various dilation rates. The receptive field of individual convolutional kernels
    was expanded when the resolution was constant, thus attaining multiscale feature
    extraction. Three dilated convolution kernels with dilation rates of 1, 2, and
    3 were parallelly connected to form a module similar to the atrous spatial pyramid
    pooling module of DeepLab V2. This module is called the Trident Block, and its
    architecture is shown in Fig. 10. The Trident Block was integrated with the feature
    pyramid network proposed by Lin et al. (2017) to add a top-down structure and
    lateral connection on the basis of the backend feature pyramid of AlexNet. Thus,
    the association between high-level and low-level features was enhanced, enabling
    the model to perform object detection with higher accuracy. Fig. 11 depicts the
    modified feature extraction architecture. The precision in the detection of individual
    broccoli plants was compared between the modified architecture and the feature
    extraction architecture of the AlexNet-Like backend at the SSD frontend, where
    the input scale of the detector complies with the original SSD architecture. The
    models were trained on the Taiwan Computing Cloud, a platform sponsored by the
    National Center for High-Performance Computing. The training was conducted in
    Tensorflow-19.11-tf2-py3. Except for the parts regarding feature extraction, the
    source code only underwent modification in areas concerning the compatibility
    between different versions of Tensorflow. The default setting of the source code
    was retained for the hyperparameters used for training; that is, adaptive moment
    estimation was used as the optimizer with the following hyperparameters: lr =
    0.001, beta_1 = 0.9, beta_2 = 0.999, epsilon = 1e-08, and decay = 0. Download

    2.5. Broccoli segmentation network training The proposed broccoli segmentation
    network is a small-scale CNN model with six asymmetric convolution (AC) layers
    (Table 4). In AC, the conventional n × n convolution is replaced by a combination
    of n × 1 and 1 × n to factorize the convolution but retain the original detection
    precision and receptive field, thereby reducing the number of parameters and the
    computational load (Szegedy et al., 2016) while enhancing the depth of the network.
    AC has been extensively applied in real-time semantic segmentation (Ghosh et al.,
    2019, Lo et al., 2019). The number of parameters in the proposed AC-based broccoli
    segmentation network is only 8.3 k. In this study, the broccoli segmentation network
    training had the same optimizer and hyperparameters as the broccoli positioning
    network, and it was trained on Nvidia GeForce GTX 980Ti with Tensorflow 2.3.0.

    for individual plants Images of the two crops were all divided into tiles with
    512 × 512 pixels in size. A margin of 50 pixels at the four sides of a tile overlapped
    with that of neighboring tiles to prevent the formation of an incomplete image
    after cropping, which may lead to inaccurate detection of the VI of a plant. An
    optimized plant detection model was used for the generation of bounding boxes,
    and non-maximum suppression (NMS) was employed to identify plants that were detected
    more than once and thus eliminate duplicate counts. Last, the coordinates of the
    centroids of bounding boxes were exported and converted to the TWD97 coordinate
    system, thus completing plant detection. Multi-spectral images were used for VI
    calculation. The coordinates of a plant in an image were estimated using the geographical
    information of the said image. Subsequently, according to the size and interval
    of the grown broccoli plants, a circular mask with a diameter of 400 mm was used
    to extract the image of a single plant. After the broccoli segmentation network
    was applied to filter out the background of the image, VI was calculated for the
    head of the broccoli plant to accurately reflect its spectral features. 2.7. Evaluation
    metrics Appendix Table A1, Table A2 list the evaluation metrics for the broccoli
    positioning network and broccoli segmentation network in this study, respectively.
    Among these, recall and precision were applied in the precision evaluation of
    both networks. In the formulae, TP denotes true positive, FP denotes false positive,
    TN denotes true negative, and FN represents false negative. For the recall and
    precision of the broccoli positioning network, TP represents the number of predicted
    broccoli plants, and the denominators denote the total number of broccoli plants
    extracted from the ground truth data and the total number of predicted broccoli
    plants, respectively. Therefore, recall and precision represent the sensitivity
    and accuracy of prediction, respectively. Intersection over union (IoU) represents
    the accuracy of bounding boxes, which is determined through the intersection and
    union of bounding boxes and ground truths. Distance in both root mean square error
    (RMSE) and meant absolute error (MAE) represents the distance between the center
    of a bounding box and the center of a ground truth; as such, it can be used to
    determine the plant positioning offset. Likewise, the recall and precision of
    the broccoli segmentation network represent the sensitivity and accuracy of prediction,
    respectively. The F1-score, which is determined using recall and precision and
    has values between 0 and 1, indicates the level of balance between two metrics;
    the closer it is to 1, the greater the robustness of the network. 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Plant detection All visible orthomosaic images used for broccoli
    positioning in this study were taken when the plants were 15–25 days old. At this
    age, all the plants could occupy>20% of a circle with a diameter of 400 mm (i.e.,
    CC > 20%) yet insufficiently large to overlap with each other. Therefore, a ground
    truth box could be easily drawn along the edges of a plant with minimal overlap
    with another box. This enabled high-precision plant detection and prevented plants
    that overlapped with each other from being mistakenly omitted as duplicates in
    the NMS. Table 5 presents the metrics for the detection accuracy of SSD with the
    two backbone networks. For the test set containing images of the first crop, the
    recall and precision of both networks reached 100%. Furthermore, the AlexNet-like
    backend had higher IoU with more favorable RMSE and MAE than Trident Block. Trident
    Block had a lower IoU because the predicted bounding box was slightly larger than
    the area occupied by a plant, which may be attributable to multiscale dilated
    convolution. Plant detection in the test set containing images of the second crop
    by using Trident Block was substantially superior, with a 95.6% recall when the
    prediction was conducted on raw images and a 100% recall after histogram matching
    was performed to match test images with the pixel distribution in images of the
    first crop for radiometric correction. Under the same conditions, the recall for
    AlexNet-like backend was 70.2% and 96.8%, respectively. These results indicate
    the superiority of dilated convolution, which uses a combination of various dilation
    rates, for plant detection when images at different scales and taken under different
    photographic conditions are used. In terms of IoU, Trident Block was the most
    favorable. In both the aforementioned conditions, the coordinates had an MAE of
    approximately 11 mm, which is acceptable considering that the broccoli has an
    average diameter of > 400 mm. The data sets of the Chiayi field contained images
    with a resolution that was half of that of the images in the training set, which
    makes the recall significantly different between the two backbone networks. In
    particular, by using the AlexNet-like backend, less than half of the total broccoli
    plants could be detected, and some bounding boxes even contained two or more plants,
    which led to the only instance in the entire experiment when a precision of 100%
    was not reached. Additionally, Trident Block outperformed AlexNet-like backend
    in terms of all metrics. These results indicate that multiscale dilated convolution
    is superior to the conventional 3 × 3 convolution when the imported images differ
    in resolution and photographic conditions, thus making dilated convolution more
    versatile for monitoring agricultural images taken in different periods and locations
    and under different conditions (e.g., equipment, flight height, and lighting).

    For the first crop, both recall and precision were 100%. For the second crop,
    after histogram matching was performed to match test images with the pixel distribution
    in images of the first crop, because the three paddy fields that received N4 treatment
    were overfertilized, which resulted in delayed or retarded growth, plant detection
    was unsatisfactory and a small number of weeds were mistakenly identified as broccoli.
    Consequently, the recall and precision were 98.58% and 99.73%, respectively. Fig.

    of results Fig. 14 presents the effect of background filtering when the Otsu algorithm
    (Otsu, 1979) and the proposed model were used for single-plant detection. The
    Otsu algorithm is fast and effective in differentiating plants from the soil in
    a large area, but in the scale of a single plant, differences in lighting conditions
    and background objects can cause the filtering results of images of individual
    broccoli plants taken in the same time period to considerably differ. For the
    test images, the Otsu algorithm achieved a recall of 90.23% and a precision of
    85.41%, whereas the proposed model achieved a recall and precision of 97.94% and
    96.52%, respectively. This proves that the proposed model is more accurate in
    filtering out the background to facilitate single-plant detection. The Otsu algorithm
    and the proposed model achieved an F1-score of 87.75% and 97.22%, respectively,
    suggesting that CNN-based background filtering is more stable. Compared with the
    Otsu algorithm, which performs image segmentation according to the difference
    in pixel values, a CNN-based method performs the task by enhancing the texture
    and geometric features, thus facilitating a more accurate separation of broccoli
    from the rest of the image. This approach enables the proposed model to calculate
    the CC and VIs of a broccoli plant with greater precision. Download : Download

    the two approaches based on their normalized difference red edge (NDRE) indices,
    clearly indicating that the visualization approach could distinctively indicate
    spots treated with different fertilizers. Moreover, the visualization approach
    enabled easy detection of plants that were missing or exhibited retarded growth
    in fields that received N4 treatment, and the uneven irrigation at the upper right
    corner of the image owing to rising terrain. By contrast, the pixel-based approach
    made the distinction of individual plants difficult because of the considerable
    difference in the NDRE values between the plants and the background. Download

    VIs to determine the phenotypic traits of plants has been extensively used in
    precision agriculture. For example, Lebourgeois et al. (2012) used numerous VIs,
    including NDVI, GNDVI (NDNG), and SRPIb, to monitor the leaf and canopy nitrogen
    contents in sugarcane, and Ballesteros et al. (2020) used an artificial neural
    network to predict the yield of a vineyard based on the NDVI and CC of grapes.
    In the present study, the results of El-Shikha et al. (2007) were referenced for
    the calculation of CC and VIs, which served as the basis for field management
    because they reflected broccoli growth under different fertilization conditions.
    The VIs investigated include NDVI and NDNG, which are indices of broccoli growth,
    and NDRE, which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll and nitrogen contents (Tarpley
    et al., 2000). The formulae for the VIs are presented in Appendix Table A.3. Fig.
    16 presents the three VIs with different levels of N treatment (nitrogen-based
    fertilizers) and K treatment (potash-based fertilizers). Differences in potash-based
    fertilizers (K1–K4) did not result in a marked difference in VIs. By contrast,
    the influence of nitrogen-based fertilizers was significant, suggesting that nitrogen
    is pivotal to broccoli growth. The N3 treatment (40 g/m2) exhibited the most favorable
    VIs, consistent with the results of Yoldas et al. (2008). In addition, the use
    of nitrogen-based fertilizers achieved optimal yield at 30 g/m2 and optimal nitrogen
    content at 45 g/m2. In the case of N1 treatment, the three VI curves gradually
    converged with those of the unfertilized control group (CK) after Day 37, suggesting
    that the shortage of nitrogen caused broccoli to become undernourished during
    head development of the plant, indirectly resulting in a drop in yield. In the
    case of N4, the CC curve almost overlapped with the CK curve before Day 27, and
    the VIs were lower than the VIs of N2 and N3 before Day 27, suggesting that a
    high nitrogen content inhibited broccoli growth early on. Moreover, although at
    a later stage, the VIs and CC of N4 became comparable to those of N2, they were
    still slightly lower than those of N3. Download : Download high-res image (634KB)

    Fig. 17 presents the NDRE of UAV images taken periodically. Overall, pixel-based
    VI distribution only exhibited a noticeable difference in that the NDREs of the
    unfertilized control group and the N1 treatment group was noticeably lower later
    in the growth period; no difference was observed in other fields. By contrast,
    results obtained using the visualization method clearly showed that plants in
    fields receiving N3 treatment exhibited stable and high growth and that because
    the source of irrigation was located at the upper edge of each field, the NDREs
    at the lower edge of fields were considerably low. These findings can be used
    as a reference in field management to detect and rectify problems. Download :

    NDRE in first crop (a) Pixel-based monitoring (b) Single-plant monitoring. Fig.
    18 presents the VIs for the second crop. Because the soil of the field where the
    second crop was planted had relatively high electrical conductivity (EC), fertilizers
    with a high nitrogen content (i.e., N3 and N4) caused excessive soil osmotic pressure
    and salinity, which in turn damaged the plant roots and caused their leaves to
    wither or grow at a slower rate. The VIs for N3 and N4 treatments were lower than
    the VIs for other treatments after Day 8. As shown in Fig. 19, the three fields
    receiving N4 treatment had large numbers of plants that were missing or exhibited
    retarded growth early in the growth period. Necrosis was also observed in fields
    receiving N3 treatment, but the number was relatively few. Additionally, Fig.
    19 reveals the presence of poorly irrigated fields (because of the rising terrain)
    that can be seen in the upper right corner of the image. Fig. 20 presents the
    NDREs obtained using the conventional pixel-based approach. Although the conventional
    pixel-based approach enables the observation of broccoli growth at different stages
    (the same effect can be achieved in Fig. 19 by fixing the NDRE interval of each
    day), the retarded growth caused by different fertilization treatments and inadequate
    field management on any given day cannot be readily observed. This limitation
    can be overcome by using the single-plant detection method. The CK and fields
    receiving N1 treatment, which afforded stable broccoli growth at early stages,
    had lower NDRE at later stages compared with fields receiving other treatments,
    similar to the results for the first crop. The same trend was observed for the
    results obtained using single-plant detection. Thus, the amount of nitrogen in
    fertilizers influences broccoli growth; in soil with high EC, high or excessive
    (N4) nitrogen can cause plants to become missing or exhibit retarded growth. No
    instance of necrosis was observed in the first crop growing in fields receiving
    N4 treatment, but the plants exhibited retarded growth and lower VIs compared
    with plants in fields receiving N3 treatment. Although with time and the provision
    of irrigation, the VIs of N4 fields for both crops were eventually higher than
    those for CK and N1 fields, which lacked fertilization, the values were not superior
    to the VIs for N2 and N3 fields, indicating that overfertilization did not provide
    any advantage. For the second crop, the plants in fields receiving N3 treatment
    exhibited retarded growth in the early growth stages, which caused their VIs to
    be slightly lower than those of plants in N2 fields; however, after Day 36, their
    VIs were comparable to those of N2 fields. Download : Download high-res image

    the CCs for each field obtained using the conventional method. The white areas
    denote the number of plants, which increased with time, and the vacant spaces
    caused by missing plants became prominent in N4-1 from Day 29 onward. Fig. 21(b)
    presents the CCs of individual plants. Evidently, most plants in all of the N4
    fields exhibited retarded growth at the beginning of the growth period, but exhibited
    stable growth later. This is an accurate representation of actual plant growth.
    Fig. 22 presents the variation in visible images of individual broccoli plants
    and the variation in CC within a circle 400 mm in diameter, which reveals the
    growth of individual plants. Fig. 23 presents the performance of two CC calculations
    in all fertilization treatments. In Fig. 23(a), the paddy field-based CCs for
    N3 and N4 treatments became saturated after Day 25 and Day 35, respectively, when
    topdressings of fertilizer were added, but they were still lower than the CCs
    for other treatments. The difference is attributable to the vacant spaces (missing
    plants) shown in Fig. 21(a). Therefore, the CC values do not accurately reflect
    the growth of plants that can be harvested. In Fig. 23(b), after two topdressings,
    the single-plant-based CCs for N4 treatment were much closer to, or even higher
    than, the CCs of the CK than to those for other treatments, and the CCs for N3
    and N4 treatments eventually became saturated and higher than the CCs for other
    treatments after Day 43. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    By obtaining the exact location and spectral features of each plant, we observed
    the difference between individual plants in detail. The cumulative number of necrotic
    plants after the five fertilization treatments and the number of surviving plants
    with the bottom 10% of NDREs are presented in Fig. 24 (a) and Fig. 24 (b), respectively.
    Because the soil in the second crop had a relatively high EC, necrosis was prominent
    in the fields that received N3 and N4 treatments from the beginning and worsened
    after Day 10, Day 25, and Day 35, when the fields were topdressed with fertilizers.
    The situation was particularly difficult on Day 25 for the fields receiving N4
    treatment because the addition of fertilizers increased the death of plants that
    exhibited retarded growth. Fig. 24(b) reveals that retarded growth (low NDRE)
    was prominent from the beginning in fields receiving N3 and N4 treatments. On
    Day 10, the growth of plants receiving N3 and N4 treatments temporarily improved
    after topdressing, and the number of plants exhibiting retarded growth temporarily
    became lower than that of the unfertilized CK. The addition of fertilizers on
    Day 25 and Day 35 steadily improved the health of plants receiving N3 and N4 treatments,
    contrary to the steady increase of unhealthy plants in fields receiving CK and
    N1 treatments. Furthermore, overall, fields receiving N3 treatment produced the
    least number of unhealthy broccoli after harvest. Although a higher amount of
    fertilizer can increase the risk of plant necrosis when the soil has a high EC,
    Fig. 24(b) shows that despite the retarded growth early in the life of plants
    that survive necrosis, with steady fertilization, the growth and yield of surviving
    plants surpass that of their peers in fields that are not fertilized or insufficiently
    fertilized (Table 6). Download : Download high-res image (232KB) Download : Download

    of intragroup differences for each treatment. Fig. 25 presents the standard deviation
    in the NDRE and CC of individual plants for each treatment. As expected, plants
    receiving N3 and N4 treatments exhibited considerable intragroup differences in
    the beginning, and plants receiving N1 treatment, which provided little nutrition,
    exhibited relatively steady growth before Day 29. This result can be used as a
    reference in the planning of fertilization schedules. During harvest, differences
    in the NDRE and CC of plants receiving N2 and N3 treatments were minimized, suggesting
    that providing an adequate amount of fertilization is conducive to reducing the
    variation in plant growth. Notably, most treatments resulted in a considerable
    increase in the standard deviation in NDRE and CC on Day 50. Further investigation
    revealed that it rained for several days in the TDARES starting on Day 49 (December
    9, 2020). This was the only instance of rain noted throughout the growth period.
    In Fig. 24(b), the numbers of plants with a low NDRE in fields receiving N2 and
    N3 treatments temporarily increased on Day 50, indicating that an adequate amount
    of rainfall can affect the spectral features of well-grown broccoli to a certain
    extent. Moreover, in Fig. 4, a part of the background in the orthomosaic image
    taken on Day 50 is visible, which causes a change in CC because the leaves of
    some plants became soft and collapsed in the rain. A corresponding drop in the
    single-plant-based CC can also be observed in Fig. 23(b). Download : Download

    provides the yields of the second crop after various nitrogen treatments. Because
    the precise location of each plant was known and necrotic plants were excluded,
    the mean plant weight could be precisely calculated. Although N3 treatment caused
    necrosis and apoptosis, it resulted in the highest total yield and yield per broccoli.
    From these observations, N3 treatment can be considered the optimal nitrogen-based
    fertilization regime for the cultivar Broccoli No. 42 because it results in the
    highest yield and relatively stable plant growth in the latter stages. Based on
    the results of single-plant monitoring, this study makes the following suggestions
    for field management: According to Fig. 16 and Fig. 18, at the beginning of the
    growth period, the amount of fertilizer used has no significant effect on the
    growth speed. Therefore, if the EC of the soil is unknown, lowering the amount
    of basal dressing to an N2 equivalent is advisable, which can prevent retarded
    growth and necrosis induced by overfertilization. The effect of various treatments
    on VIs was noticeable only from Day 22–29 onward. Although the topdressing performed
    on Day 10 temporarily lowered the number of plants with low NDRE in fields receiving
    N3 and N4 treatments, the effect lasted for merely one week, after which the number
    increased again and only became steady after Day 29. This finding indicates that
    topdressings are unnecessary in an early stage (before Day 22), which is consistent
    with the findings of Feller and Fink (2005). If the soil has a high EC before
    the broccoli is planted, topdressings too close to the date of basal dressing
    can easily induce necrosis among the plants exhibiting retarded growth. Both the
    crops in fields receiving excessive fertilization (N4) had unfavorable CCs before
    Day 32. The CCs of the first crop were similar to that of the unfertilized control
    group, whereas the second crop had the lowest CC, which was attributable to retarded
    growth caused by overfertilization. This proves that excessive fertilization does
    not improve broccoli growth but can induce necrosis. The VIs of the first crop
    in fields receiving N4 treatment (overfertilization) were largely the same as
    the VIs of the crop in fields receiving N1 treatment (underfertilization). By
    contrast, for the second crop, although the plants receiving N4 treatment experienced
    retarded growth, their VIs did not differ significantly compared with plants receiving
    other treatments before Day 29. Therefore, when VIs alone are not sufficient to
    determine whether a field is overfertilized or underfertilized, CC can be used
    to determine whether plants in said field exhibit retarded growth, which is an
    indication of overfertilization. Single-plant monitoring can improve the precision
    of CC calculation because the method is not affected by plant interval and missing
    plants. Therefore, visualizing the results of single-plant monitoring can reveal
    signs of poor field management, such as uneven irrigation, fertilization, or terrain.
    Compared with pixel-based VI distribution, single-plant monitoring combined with
    visualization can greatly enhance the efficiency and precision of field management.
    Moreover, it can be further integrated with techniques in precision pesticide
    application, disease detection, and optimal harvest time recognition to substantially
    reduce the labor required in patrolling, thereby improving precision agriculture
    efficiency. Broccoli plants that are 15–25 days old (growth stage) are most suitable
    for generating bounding boxes because they are not too large to overlap with each
    other, but sufficiently large to have a CC that enables a bounding box to be placed
    neatly along the edges of a broccoli plant. This prevents the risk of omission
    of plants that overlap with each other because of being mistakenly identified
    as duplicates. Therefore, plant detection at this plant age is advisable. 4. Conclusion
    With the increasing environmental awareness and shortage of farming labor, developing
    a system that aids agricultural decision-making while reducing the costs related
    to pesticides, fertilizers, and labor is imperative. In this study, visible/multi-spectral
    UAV imagery was integrated with two DL methods—object detection and semantic segmentation—to
    effectively extract necessary information from UAV images to obtain a visualized
    map that could assist in precise field monitoring and management. Additionally,
    this study optimized a classic DL architecture to maximize crop detection precision
    when the data are limited. For plant detection, feature extraction was conducted
    using multiscale dilated convolution, which enabled the effective detection of
    broccoli in images that were taken under different photographic conditions and
    resolutions. Subsequently, histogram matching was performed to achieve 100% recall
    and precision for the second crop. For the test set comprising images taken in
    a field in Lucao, Chiayi, a recall of 61.13% was achieved using dilated convolution,
    considerably higher than the recall of 42.49% achieved through conventional 3
    × 3 convolution, proving the excellent applicability of dilated convolution in
    agricultural aerial imagery. The use of plant coordinates, spectral information,
    and the plant segmentation network for precise calculation of VIs and CC enables
    the generation of a large-area growth map in the scale of single plants. Compared
    with the conventional pixel-based plant indices or spectral features, this visualized
    map straightforwardly presents the growth of individual plants, which allows operators
    to easily detect situations such as uneven irrigation or fertilization for future
    reference, greatly enhancing the viability of precision agriculture. The integration
    of single-plant detection and VI analysis for the visualization of results and
    the calculation of unit yield enables effective analysis of the difference between
    fertilization regimes, including intragroup differences for a regime. Thus, the
    optimal amount of fertilization for Broccoli No. 42 can easily be established
    without conducting the conventional labor-intensive field sampling and investigation.
    On the basis of single-plant monitoring, this study proposed a fertilization decision-making
    method for Broccoli No. 42 according to the VIs and CCs observed at various stages
    of broccoli growth. The proposed approach can also be used to observe the size
    of broccoli heads to determine the optimal harvest time. In addition, the single-plant
    detection method can be integrated with disease detection to quantify the degree
    of damage caused by disease in the future. Expectedly, the method may also be
    applied in the monitoring and management of other crops as well as in the optimization
    of irrigation and fertilization decision-making to improve efficiency and reduce
    the labor demand for precision agriculture. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: The progress made in developing information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) and the fact that water resources are becoming increasingly scarce make
    precision agriculture a very valuable tool for efficient and sustainable crop
    management, particularly for irrigation and fertili-sation. In line with this,
    the water balance estimate is considered one of the most accurate methods for
    estimating crops’ water requirements. The Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research
    Group of the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (Spain) has worked in this direction
    to obtain portable weighing lysimeters with improved functions compared to traditional
    measurement systems. This study analysed the most important vegetable crops in
    south-eastern Spain to standardise suitable dimensions so that these portable
    weighing lysimeters can monitor practically all of today’s vegetable and herbaceous
    crops in Mediterranean climates. The dimensions established for the cultivation
    tank are 150 cm long, 45 cm wide, and 50 cm deep, with an equipment resolution
    of up to 0.09 mm expressed as water lamina. The validation over seven irrigation
    events established that the structural system achieved here allows precise monitoring
    of the water exchanges produced in the cultivation tank, so this portable weighing
    lysimeter can be useful for the efficient management of fertigation.

  explanation: From this scientific work, the key insight gained is that automated,
    real-time irrigation management plays a key part in enhancing agricultural productivity
    for meeting the growing demand for food, while also optimally utilizing water
    resources. End-to-end, automated irrigation management systems that combine IoT
    and machine learning are an integral part of addressing global food challenges
    and sustainably meeting future demands.

    is essential for the supply of food to society, especially with the production
    of fruits and vegetables. In Spain, fruit and vegetable production represents
    20% of the total European production (mean between 2013 and 2017 [1]), which certainly
    demonstrates how important Spanish agriculture is in this sector. The value of
    Spanish vegetable production is similar to that of fruit production, although
    the surface area employed for vegetable production is half that for fruit production
    [1]. These data show that Spanish vegetable crops are highly productive, and south-eastern
    (SE) Spain sends the biggest amounts of vegetables to Europe, with 70% of all
    vegetable exports coming from Spain [2]. Agricultural production will face certain
    challenges in the coming years that must be overcome to attend to the growing
    population, and there is no alternative but to be more productive in a scenario
    where natural resources become increasingly scarce and climate change takes place
    [3,4]. Hence, investments in the improvement of water control and management are
    being prioritised [5]. Many studies are being conducted to obtain tools that achieve
    water control in order to promote efficient water management, and these are mostly
    supported through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).
    The use of ICTs to manage horticulture with precision agriculture techniques can
    help the sector to move towards long-standing sustainable management and to meet
    the coming environmental challenges [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Irrigation management
    is a complex activity that is influenced by many factors that are closely related
    to the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. Other factors are also important in deciding
    the irrigation criteria, such as the quality of the irrigation water or the crops’
    nutrition. Pressurized irrigation allows water control systems to be established
    for efficient management. Soil moisture sensors are used to obtain signals from
    the plant root zone that can be read by data acquisition equipment, and actuators
    are used to control the irrigation system based on the parameterized criteria
    [14]. Generally, with the exception of bottom fertilizer applications, fertilizers
    are applied to irrigation water regardless of the irrigation method used. Therefore,
    fertilization must be considered to manage irrigation. In light of the above,
    it follows that irrigation is directly related to the supply of nutrients to crops.
    Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that, to achieve efficient water management
    during irrigation, it is necessary to control the entire water and nutritional
    balance [15,16,17,18]. The objective of efficient irrigation control is twofold:
    (1) to supply the minimum dose of water necessary to satisfy the water needs of
    a crop without increasing the salinity of the soil; (2) to achieve the contribution
    of nutrients with minimal leaching to contain environmental pollution. Therefore,
    it is essential to monitor all components of the water balance and how the water
    quality evolves in both the nutrient solution and the leaching to deeper layers
    (drainage) [19,20]. The weighing lysimeter is a useful tool used by many researchers
    to accurately measure the use of water in crops [21,22,23,24,25,26]. A weighing
    lysimeter can quantify water inputs and losses, and it also quantifies losses
    due to drainage. Thus, by means of nutritional analysis of the water input and
    the drained water, a nutritional balance can be established [27]. In recent years,
    the Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research Group of the Universidad Politécnica
    de Cartagena (Spain) has worked on obtaining accurate, robust, practical, low-cost,
    and portable weighing lysimetry equipment by progressively adding functions that
    make it extremely useful for knowing how a crop develops in terms of water and
    nutritional uses [28,29,30,31]. The research objective is to obtain a useful and
    standard tool based on the weighing lysimeter in order to make the newly developed
    weighing lysimeter more versatile and commercial. For this purpose, this study
    was based on the analysis of the main vegetable crops (including herbaceous crops)
    in order to define the most suitable dimensions and functions. The portable nature
    of the weighing lysimeter is based on the fact that, with little investment, it
    can be relocated in order to monitor different parts of a farm after the end of
    a crop cycle. 2. Materials and Methods In order to obtain the dimensions of the
    proposed portable weighing lysimeter and to standardise a model for its commercial
    use on vegetable farms, a study was conducted on the most representative crops
    in SE Spain. The most relevant dimensional parameters for defining the equipment
    were established, and the weighing system’s features were analysed. 2.1. Crops
    under Study As vegetable crops are extremely important in Spain, especially in
    SE Spain, the production of the most important vegetables grown in the Murcia
    Region and neighbouring regions was analysed. Using the Regional Farming Statistics
    of the Regional Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fishing of the Spanish
    Murcia Region Autonomous Community (Spain) [32], data on the production of the
    10 most productive crops were collected for the 2011–2017 period (Table 1). The
    selected crops were, in order of greater to lesser importance: lettuce, tomato,
    watermelon, melon, broccoli, pepper, artichoke, celery, onion, and courgette.
    To confirm if the choice of crops was correct, the production of all 10 crops
    was compared to the total crop production for each year. The obtained results
    are found in Table 2. Table 1. Evolution of the production (in tonnes) of the
    main vegetable crops in the Murcia Region [32]. Table 2. Relative importance in
    relation to the production quantity of the main vegetable crops in the Murcia
    Region. After deciding which vegetable crops were the most important ones for
    the Murcia Region, the production of these 10 selected crops, which roughly represented
    95% of all vegetable production, was compared to corroborate if they were also
    important when consulting the statistical data from the neighbouring Regional
    Governments of the Valencian Community, Andalusia, and Castilla la Mancha (Spain).
    Table 3 shows the production data for these vegetable crops in relation to the
    total vegetable production in each region. Table 3. Relative importance in relation
    to the production quantity of the main vegetable crops in neighbouring regions.
    The intention of the crop choice was to learn both taxonomic and agronomic characteristics
    in order to know the suitable dimensions for a cultivation tank of a commercial
    portable weighing lysimeter. Therefore, the taxonomic and agronomic characteristics
    of all of the selected crops were studied [36,37,38,39,40,41]. According to the
    obtained information, Table 4 shows the main crop characteristics (average values)
    that can affect the dimensions of portable weighing lysimetry equipment. Table
    4. Main characteristics of the most important crops in south-eastern (SE) Spain
    (average values) [36,37,38,39,40,41]. To be installed, portable weighing lysimetry
    equipment is buried below a crop line and left on the farm. Therefore, its dimensions
    must allow it to be left and integrated with all of the selected crops. To this
    end, the mechanisation and production systems of the different crops, especially
    lettuce and melon, were analysed, but this can also be done with the other crops.
    Figure 1 illustrates the normal lettuce production system, which includes crop
    beds that are commonly known as “estrechas/narrow beds”. They measure 18 cm high
    and 55 cm wide (top), with a 90 cm distance between the two axes of two parallel
    consecutive beds. They are inclined in such a way that each slope is horizontally
    projected by 12.5 cm, and have a 10 cm wide bearing base. This production system
    is commonplace for lettuce, broccoli, and celery, and is sometimes used for onion.
    At the top, two rows of plants are arranged per bed, except for onion, which is
    laid in more rows. Figure 1. Scheme of the standardization of the mechanised production
    of lettuce in narrow crop beds. On the right, it is shown how the machine operates,
    leaving two complete narrow crop beds between its wheels; on the left are the
    details of the dimensions of a narrow crop bed. Figure 2 depicts the baby lettuce
    production system with crop beds that are frequently called “anchas/wide beds”.
    They are 18 cm high and 140 cm wide at the top, with a 180 cm distance between
    the axes of two parallel consecutive beds, and the slopes are inclined in such
    a way that each slope is horizontally projected by 15 cm, with a 10 cm wide bearing
    base. This production system is mainly used for baby lettuce, onion, or baby leaf.
    For baby lettuce, it is common to use six rows per bed, or between 8 and 12 rows
    for onion, while baby leaf is grown by being directly sown all over the surface.
    Figure 2. Scheme of the standardisation of the mechanised production of lettuce
    in wide crop beds. On the right, it is shown how the machinery circulates, leaving
    a complete wide crop bed between its wheels; on the left are the details of the
    dimensions of a wide crop bed. Figure 3 shows the melon production system, which
    is flat with no crop beds. A separation between crop lines of 180 cm is standard
    practice. Therefore, this production system can be extended to any crop that is
    grown flat without crop beds (tomato, watermelon, pepper, artichoke, courgette,
    etc.). Figure 3. Scheme of the standardization of the mechanised production of
    melon. On the right, it is shown how the machine operates, leaving a crop line—not
    a crop bed—between its wheels. The details of the dimensions of the plantation
    frames without a crop bed are shown on the left. All three figures reflect the
    mechanisation scheme so that, in depending on the production system, two narrow
    crop beds, one wide crop bed, or a row of crops can coincide below the tractor.
    2.2. Description of the Portable Weighing Lysimeter Having obtained all of the
    information about the characteristics of the plants and farming systems, the three
    characteristic dimensions of the cultivation tank for the portable weighing lysimeter
    (height, length, and depth) were defined. To this end, the main portable weighing
    lysimetry equipment structures were defined (Figure 4). Figure 4. Main portable
    weighing lysimeter structures. (a) Main structure (MS): The portable weighing
    lysimeter was designed to be buried and to support a portion of soil that is to
    be monitored. To do so, a structure is needed that can house all the components
    used to quantify the soil + water + plant set mass and drainage. This structure
    must be such that the earth surrounding it does not apply any force on the cultivation
    tank’s weighing system. This structure acts as a covering for all of the equipment,
    is made of stainless steel, and is totally airtight, so neither capillary rises
    nor high phreatic levels interfere. (b) Support structure (SS): This structure
    supports the weight of the cultivation tank with the four load cells that comprise
    it. It must also independently support deep percolation drainage, which is quantified
    by means of a tank that holds this volume and is supported by a load cell that
    is independent of the others. This structure is anchored to the interior of the
    MS, and was devised to independently hold the cultivation tank to ensure its manoeuvrability.
    All of the elements required for the portable weighting lysimetry equipment to
    work properly are considered in this structure. (c) Cultivation tank (CT): This
    structure houses the portion of soil to be monitored. The number of plants that
    it contains depends on the planting framework. Its dimensions must be big enough
    for it to hold any type of vegetable or herbaceous crop, and it is integrated
    into farms depending on the system that they have set up. It is designed with
    stainless steel. It has several reinforcements that can support the load, as well
    as a deep percolation drainage system. This system continues with the drainage
    tank, which is the part of the equipment that quantifies the drainage. (d) Drainage
    tank (DT): This quantifies the deep percolation drainage with a load cell and
    qualifies it with an electric conductivity sensor. (e) Electrical control panel:
    This allows the registration of the information from the two weighing systems
    (the cultivation tank and the drainage tank) in data acquisition equipment. The
    weighing system of the cultivation tank has four load cells that are connected
    in parallel in a summing box so that a shielded six-wire line leads to the first
    weighing indicator. The other weighing system, that of the drainage tank, has
    one load cell connected directly to the second weighing indicator. Both read the
    load cells with a resolution of 24 bits and are connected to the datalogger CAMPBELL
    SCI. CR300 by MODBUS RTU RS485. All of the operating cycle management algorithms
    of the complete lysimetry system are embedded in the datalogger in order to be
    able to accurately quantify both the variations that occur in the culture tank
    and those that occur in the drainage tank. 2.3. The Cultivation Tank’s Dimensional
    Characteristics Having determined the portable weighing lysimetry equipment’s
    MS, the CT’s dimensions, which are closely related to the dimensions of the complete
    equipment, were calculated: (a) Equipment width: The equipment must be able to
    fit inside any crop system and must be adapted to the production system. For this
    reason, the most limiting production system is the narrow crop bed type. To be
    able to fit the portable weighing lysimetry equipment in a narrow crop bed, the
    maximum width must be 55 cm so that it correctly fits inside its top. Thus, the
    main structure’s (external) width (outer dimensions) measures 55 cm. Bearing the
    portable weighing lysimeter’s structural features in mind, we find that: ▪ The
    MS’s thickness will be 2 cm all around its perimeter. ▪ The CT’s thickness will
    be 2 cm all around its perimeter. ▪ The required gap between the MS and the CT
    will be 1 cm all around its perimeter in order to avoid effects on readings from
    both elements rubbing against one another. Therefore, the CT’s width (inner dimensions)
    will be the difference between the MS’s width, less twice the sum of the thicknesses
    of the MS and the CT, plus the gap between both: ▪ Inner CT width = 55 − 2 × (2
    + 2 + 1) = 45 cm. (b) Equipment length: This distance must allow at least two
    plants to be planted inside the equipment. By considering the planting distance
    set out in Table 4, the planting distance of one crop tends to be 200 cm; for
    the established portable weighing lysimetry equipment design, increasing its length
    to 400 cm would not be technically or economically feasible. Thus, an exception
    was made for watermelon because only one plant would be monitored, and the following
    crops were considered, whose frames (75 cm) are the most separate: artichoke or
    courgette. In this way, the inner CT length would result from multiplying the
    minimum number of plants to be monitored (two plants) by the planting distance
    between both along one line (75 cm): ▪ Inner CT length = 75 × 2 = 150 cm. The
    total MS length (outer dimensions) is the sum of the inner CT length, plus twice
    the sum of the thicknesses of the MS and the CT, plus the gap between the two:
    ▪ Outer MS length = 150 + 2 × (2 + 2 + 1) = 160 cm. (c) Equipment depth: The CT
    must be able to house the root systems of crops with more root development. The
    literature offers many values for this parameter, and Table 4 summarises the mean
    depth values for each crop. According to this information, the maximum CT depth
    must be 50 cm. Performing deep percolation drainage towards the DT’s draining
    channels must take place at the bottom of the equipment. To this end, a 5 cm slope
    was considered so that the depth all along the CT’s perimeter would be the difference
    in the maximum depth, less the margin determined as the drainage slope: ▪ Maximum
    CT depth = 50 cm. ▪ Minimum CT depth = 50 − 5 = 45 cm. To determine the CT’s depth,
    the load cell dimensions were also taken into account to avoid compromising the
    solving data due to excess mass. 2.4. Weighing System Calculations The calculations
    that are performed to specify the CT’s depth and to define the weighing system
    of the equipment with the load cellsare then determined. (a) Estimating masses:
    The masses estimated to support the CT’s measurement system are: ▪ CT mass = 70
    kg. ▪ Established soil density = 2650 kg·m−3 [42]. A 30% reduction is applied
    to estimate the apparent density owing to porosity: 2650 × (1 − 0.3) = 1855 kg·m−3.
    ▪ Mean CT depth: This is calculated as the average between the maximum and minimum
    depths: (0.5 − 0.45)/2 = 0.475 m. ▪ CT volume: This is the product of the inner
    length, inner width, and the mean depth: 1.5 × 0.45 × 0.475 = 0.321 m3. ▪ Contained
    soil mass: This is the product of the CT’s volume and apparent density: 0.321
    × 1855 = 595 kg. ▪ Dead weight: This is the load that, despite it being measured
    by load cells, is not of any interest for the process. In this case, the dead
    weight is determined by the CT’s weight plus the contained soil mass because the
    values of interest are those of the interchange water mass and the plant material
    mass: 70 + 595 = 665 kg. ▪ Plant material mass: This depends on the crop that
    is used, but an initial baseline is taken at 50 kg. ▪ Soil water mass: The amount
    of water that soil can contain while keeping up to field capacity. Initially,
    field capacity is estimated as 25% of volumetric humidity, and the water density
    is taken as 1000 kg·m−3: 0.321 × 0.25 × 1000 = 80 kg. ▪ Interchange water mass:
    This is the additional mass that results from water from inputs such as precipitation,
    torrents, or irrigation, and it is initially estimated as 10 kg. ▪ Total water
    mass: This is the sum of the soil water mass and the interchange water mass: 80
    + 10 = 90 kg. ▪ Staking mass: For certain creeping crops, such as peppers and
    tomatoes, staking systems are required for separating growth due to the plant
    material inside the lysimeter. To avoid plants being staked in the equipment’s
    outer structures, a staking system is joined only to the CT: 15 kg. ▪ Accidental
    overload: Sometimes, the lysimeter may have to support a load that can overexert
    load cells. This must be taken into account by estimating the load to be 100 kg.
    Accidental overloads can be understood as the footfalls of workers and/or animals
    or farming practises, such as pruning, weeding, harvesting, fertilizer, fumigation,
    etc. (b) Scale definition: For scale calculations, the total mass and supporting
    mass are considered: ▪ Total mass for the scale: This is the sum of all of the
    previously estimated masses, which are the dead weight plus the plant material
    mass and the total water mass, as well as the staking mass and accidental overload:
    665 + 50 + 90 + 15 + 100 = 920 kg. ▪ Number of scale supports = four units. ▪
    Support mass: Theoretically, this is the mass that each support withstands, and
    it is equal if correctly levelled and fitted. It is the ratio between the total
    mass and the number of supports: 920/4 = 230 kg. (c) The cell’s minimum nominal
    capacity: This is the minimum nominal capacity that the load cell must have for
    readings to be correct. It is calculated by applying a safety coefficient to the
    previously calculated support mass, whose value lies between 1.25 and 2.5. The
    contemplated factor is 1.25 after considering the equipment’s accidental overloads
    and maximum possible resolution for quantifying the water balance: 230 × 1.25
    = 287 kg. (d) Choice of load cell: Albeit somewhat limited, a load cell with a
    300 kg nominal capacity can be placed to support the maximum possible resolution;
    nevertheless, a load cell with a 500 kg nominal capacity is suitable so that equipment
    is more robust and less sensitive to overload breakdowns. The following calculations
    were performed, and they show that the resolution is transferred to the water
    lamina unit to extrapolate the results to crops outside the weighing lysimeter.
    To obtain the parameter emin, which indicates the resolution that the scale is
    capable of offering, two forms of calculation were considered. Calculating the
    parameter emin with the fraction Vmin: ▪ Nominal capacity fractions: This is the
    number of fractions into which the cell load’s nominal capacity can be divided.
    ▪ Fraction Vmin: This is the minimum fraction value of a load cell, which is the
    ratio between its nominal capacity and the nominal capacity fractions. ▪ Scale
    division step: This is the product of the fraction Vmin and the square root of
    the number of supports, and is equivalent to the scale’s resolution. This parameter
    can be taken as emin (rep), which is obtained with the scale’s resolution. Calculating
    the emin parameter by means of linearity: We previously indicated that the scale
    has a dead weight that is used to quantify a load, and both magnitudes are supported
    by the set of load cells. This is a peculiar scale given the weighing lysimeter
    equipment’s features, as the proportion of dead weight is much higher than the
    load to be quantified. In this case, the dead weight is estimated as the CT’s
    mass plus the contained soil mass, which is much higher than the mass to be quantified
    for accurate irrigation management purposes, i.e., specifically, the interchange
    water mass (mostly irrigation or rainfall, drainage, and evapotranspiration).
    Thus, the scale is used to quantify less than 1% of its nominal capacity, and
    its resolution is also sufficient. ▪ The maximum load for exact quantification
    is equivalent to the interchange water mass = 10 kg. ▪ The nlc parameter value
    of the load cell is 3000. With these data, the emin parameter (lin) is the ratio
    between the maximum load to be quantified and the nlc value, irrespectively of
    the nominal capacity of the employed cell. ▪ emin (lin) = 10/3000 = 0.003 kg.
    iii The emin parameter’s value: This is the maximum value that results from the
    two calculation methods. Table 5 offers the results of the calculations performed
    for the two nominal capacities of the load cell to be chosen. Table 5. Calculations
    of characteristic scale parameters to choose the nominal capacity of the load
    cells. (e) The lysimeter’s resolution: This magnitude, which is expressed through
    water lamina, is interesting for validation of the potential of the tool developed
    by our research group. It relates the previously calculated resolution (emin parameter)
    to the lysimeter’s surface, specifically that of the CT. With this unit, data
    can be extrapolated to other plots. ▪ CT surface: This is the product of the CT’s
    inner length and width: 1.5 × 0.45 = 0.675 m2. Based on the density established
    for water, which was previously defined, and the equivalence of 1 mm water lamina
    = 1 L·m−2, the lysimeter’s resolution, which is expressed through the water lamina,
    is the ratio between the emin parameter (in kg) and the surface (in m2). Table
    6 shows the calculation of the lysimeter’s resolution according to the selected
    nominal capacity of the load cell. Table 6. Calculation of characteristic scale
    parameters to choose the nominal capacity of load cells. 2.5. Previous Experiences
    Studies published by the Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research Group (Universidad
    Politécnica de Cartagena, Spain) show that weighing lysimetry equipment is effective
    for monitoring the water balance of a crop [18,28]. The designs prior to the last
    development were able to adequately record variations in the cultivation tank
    and in the drainage tank; however, they lacked robustness and practicality. Hence
    came the idea of trying to improve the design to solve problems such as the integration
    of cultivation in different exploitation and mechanisation systems, facilitating
    maintenance work, or avoiding problems due to rising water tables. Then, starting
    from a system that was already capable of quantifying the water inlets and outlets
    of the cultivation tank and quantifying the drainage, the following structural
    changes were made: (a) A catchment tank for the water drained by the culture tank
    was incorporated with the aim of making it independent from its control solenoid
    valve, thus facilitating maintenance work. (b) The perimeter structure was waterproofed
    to avoid being affected by rises in the water table. (c) The dimensions were modified
    to be able to adapt to the majority of vegetable and herbaceous crops. Therefore,
    the validation of the standard equipment focused on recognising that the weighing
    system of the culture tank, which is the one that was finally modified, was able
    to adequately reflect small water exchanges inside the tank. 2.6. Validating the
    Weighing System In order to validate the prototype, a functional trial was considered
    with pepper crops grown in greenhouses. After approximately 40 post-transplant
    days, seven irrigation times without drainage were analysed. During each irrigation
    time, 10 min of verification were used halfway through the irrigation to ensure
    that the irrigation fitting’s water regime was stable. The final and initial CT
    weight values were compared to find the increase in quantity by taking the water
    density as 1000 g·L−1. Variations in weight on the days immediately before and
    after the sampling period, as well as at the same time, were analysed to check
    if evapotranspiration, albeit negligible, took place at these times. Even so,
    any variation in CT weight was taken as being due to irrigation. The following
    variables can be defined: CT weight at the start of the sampling period, CTi,
    expressed in g. CT weight at the end of the sampling period, CTf, expressed in
    g. Variation in CT weight during the sampling period, CTap, expressed in g, which
    is equivalent to the water volume given in mL. CTap = CTf − CTi (1) Transmitters
    were set at a 30 cm distance (with five transmitters along the weighing lysimeter’s
    150 cm length), with a theoretical flow rate of 3.00 L·h−1 (sandy clay loam soil).
    When transferring variations in weight to the flow released by drips, the irrigation
    time, the number of drips inside the lysimeter, and the water density were taken
    into account. The practical flow variable of drip, qp, is expressed in L·h−1.
    𝑞 𝑝 ( 𝐿 ℎ·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 )= 𝐶 𝑇 𝑎𝑝 (𝑔) 10(𝑚𝑖𝑛) · 1(𝐿) 1000(𝑔) · 60(𝑚𝑖𝑛) 1(ℎ) 5(𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟)
    (2) In order to confirm that the flow that was estimated with the data obtained
    in the weighing lysimeter and adjusted to the theoretical transmitters’ flow corresponded
    to reality, a manual test on one transmitter was performed. This test provided
    a volume. To translate it into the transmitter’s flow, it was related to the time
    that the test lasted by defining the manual flow variable (qm), expressed in L·h−1.
    𝑞 𝑚 ( 𝐿 ℎ·𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 )= 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒(𝐿) 25(𝑚𝑖𝑛) · 60(𝑚𝑖𝑛) 1(ℎ) 1(𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟) (3) In
    order to validate that the redesigned structure is capable of quantifying the
    water balance, a function for which it was conceived, the results obtained in
    two tests were compared. Thus, first of all, the data were obtained in a test
    developed in Aguaderas, T.M. de Lorca (Murcia, Spain) with a Naxos-variety broccoli
    crop that was transplanted on 12 March 2020, and had its last harvest day on 1
    June 2020, obtaining a cultivation cycle of 82 days. The crop had plastic mulch.
    Data obtained with the weighing lysimeter (which offers the weight variation of
    the culture container) on several specific days were contrasted with the reference
    evapotranspiration offered through the network of meteorological stations of the
    SIAM (Agricultural Information System of Murcia) of IMIDA (Agrarian and Food Research
    and Development Institute of Murcia, Spain). The data of variations in the weight
    of the culture container on days in which there were no drainage or contributions
    of water by irrigation or precipitation were related to the lysimeter’s surface
    of influence. The surface of the cultivation tank was 150 cm long by 45 cm wide,
    while the culture had a separation between lines of 90 cm; thus, given that the
    lysimeter supported and monitored plants whose evaporative condition corresponded
    to 90 cm, it was considered that the lysimeter’s surface of influence (CIsurface)
    was 150 cm long by 90 cm wide, resulting in 1.35 m2. Since the soil was mulched,
    the evaporation component of the 45 cm not monitored through the lysimeter could
    be neglected. This surface was important for transferring the units of grams to
    the magnitude of the height of the water sheet. The data obtained in the weighing
    lysimeter correspond to the result of the following equation. 𝐸 𝑇 𝑎 =𝐸 𝑇 0 · 𝐾
    𝑐 (4) ET0: Reference evapotranspiration—obtained from the SIAM—which comes from
    the Penman–Monteith–FAO equation and is expressed in mm. Kc: Crop coefficient,
    which depends on specific edaphoclimatic conditions, cultural work, variety, phenological
    state, etc., and which corrects the reference evapotranspiration value to estimate
    the evapotranspiration of a given crop. As a result: ETa: This is the actual evapotranspiration
    according to Sánchez et al. [26]. The values relative to the weight variation
    of the culture container in a weighing lysimeter after considering the water inputs
    from irrigation or rain and the losses from deep percolation reflect the result
    of this actual evapotranspiration. Thus, if the weight variation in the culture
    container (expressed in mm of the water sheet) is compared with the reference
    evapotranspiration, the Kc coefficient is obtained: Δ𝐶𝑇( 𝐾𝑔 𝑑𝑎𝑦 )· 1 𝜌 ( 𝐿 𝐾𝑔

    the Cultivation Tank With respect to production, the crops selected in this study
    are relative important, as they make up 95% of all the vegetable products grown
    in the Murcia Region (Spain). Although these crops are not so extensively grown
    in neighbouring regions, their production represents more than 60% of all of their
    vegetable production. So, our analysis, which aimed to suitably size the portable
    weighing lysimeter’s CT, is very useful because, in commercial terms, this equipment
    is extremely versatile for such crops and, by extension, for herbaceous crops.
    Moreover, this type of tool is widely accepted in the vegetable market. After
    considering the study and calculations that were performed, the dimensions set
    for the CT were defined as 45 cm inner width, 150 cm inner length, and a mean
    depth of 47.5 cm, with a minimum of 45 cm on its perimeter and a maximum of 50
    cm in the centre (the point where deep percolation drains to the DT) (Figure 5).
    Figure 5. Cultivation tank (CT) dimensions. 3.2. Validating the Weighing System
    The data obtained in order to calculate each transmitter’s practical flow on the
    seven study days with the pepper crops are shown in Table 7 and Table 8. Table

    the Kc at different times during the broccoli crop cycle using the designed lysimeter
    (Kc lysimeter) in comparison with the theoretical values found using published
    data from the studies of Rubino et al. [43] and Villalobos-Reyes et al. [44] and
    with the FAO-56 data [45]. Figure 6. Comparison of the product of the Kc coefficient
    lysimeter with the theoretical cultivation Kc coefficient for broccoli found through
    weighing lysimetry, as well as from the studies of Rubino et al. [43] and Villalobos-Reyes
    et al. [44] and with the FAO-56 data [45]. 4. Discussion Table 4 summarises the
    taxonomic and agronomic characteristics of the studied crops. With planting frames,
    the frame choice depends on many factors, but, except for watermelon crops, two
    or more plants of the other crops can be grown inside a lysimeter, which allows
    suitable representativeness. Although the root depth varies according to the crop,
    the active zone is always in the upper soil layers [46]. Thus, the depth with
    which the CT was designed allows practically the whole root volume to be housed,
    and the crop inside is exposed to similar conditions to those outside the lysimeter.
    The standardization of production systems and their mechanisation allow the portable
    weighing lysimetry equipment to be set up similarly to the equipment developed
    by the Agromotic Engineering and Sea Research Group of the Universidad Politécnica
    de Cartagena (Spain). This is enabled by it being perfectly integrated into crop
    lines, on narrow crop beds (Figure 1) or wide crop beds (Figure 2), or when crops
    are grown flat (Figure 3). After analysing the loads that could support the equipment
    by means of the CT, it was deduced that increasing the depth was counterproductive
    because it limited the nominal capacity of the load cells to be used, which would
    reduce the equipment’s resolution. With the dimensions indicated herein for the
    CT, a crop surface of 0.675 m2 was obtained. Compared to any other water balance
    estimation method—for instance, with humidity sensors [47]—this surface area is
    large because sensors are only able to monitor a small volume around the point
    where they are fitted. In addition, portable weighing lysimetry equipment quantifies,
    rather than estimates, water balance components because it quantifies and qualifies
    deep percolation drainage. It also quantifies water inputs due to irrigation and
    precipitation as well as losses through evapotranspiration. Depending on the type
    of load cell being used, resolutions between 0.09 and 0.15 mm can be accomplished.
    End users can obtain the resolution that they are interested in at the same weighing
    lysimetry equipment cost. For example, if the equipment is to be used for research
    purposes, the load cell to be fitted can be one with 300 kg of nominal capacity,
    which gives a resolution of 0.09 mm. However, for commercial farming, the equipment
    management conditions are not the same because the personnel who perform cultivation
    tasks do not necessarily have to be specifically trained in handling this equipment,
    and they might sporadically apply loads that can harm 300 kg load cells. Therefore,
    for commercial farming, fitting 500 kg load cells will guarantee that the equipment
    lasts, but with a 0.15 mm resolution. Nonetheless, considering that the reference
    evapotranspiration can be of the order of 6–7 mm, accurate irrigation can be achieved
    at the obtained resolution. The resolution is conditioned by the sampling surface.
    Generally, for crops with limited growth habits, the calculated surface area of
    0.675 m2 is that which the weighing lysimeter actually monitors. However, for
    crops with more expansive growth habits or creeping crops, such as melon and even
    watermelon, which can cover a 4 m2 surface area, the measurements taken by the
    lysimeter do not only affect a surface area of 0.675 m2. The plant, which covers
    a much greater surface than that of the CT, draws water from inside the lysimeter.
    So, the resolution value is significantly reduced. In commercial terms, where
    the surface area used is important, the data obtained with the weighing lysimeter
    can provide irrigation recommendations. Instead of being expressed as water lamina,
    they are expressed as water volume per plant, which is more representative and
    can be perfectly extrapolated to the interior of the monitored farmland. For all
    these reasons, the dimensions of the portable weighing lysimetry equipment are
    suitable, and it accurately manages irrigation thanks to the high resolution that
    it offers. If we consider its fitted sensors for quantifying and qualifying deep
    percolation drainage (a load cell for the DT and an electric conductivity sensor
    inside it), nutrition can also be managed. By adding another conductivity sensor
    to the irrigation line, irrigation and fertilisation can also be managed to avoid
    saline concentration in the humid bulb. The equipment has a tank for taking samples
    to sporadically test irrigation water, drained water, and even soil and plant
    material in order to know and correct the nutrient balance [16]. After checking
    the weighing system by analysing a set of five transmitters that poured onto the
    lysimeter at a theoretical flow of 3.00 L·h−1, according to Table 7, we confirmed
    that the equipment recorded this pluviometry value for each transmitter at a mean
    rate of 3.01 L·h−1. To confirm that the measurement was correct, a manual test
    was performed, which, according to Table 8, gave a flow of 2.88 L·h−1. We should
    bear in mind that the accuracy of the measurements in terms of time and obtained
    volume was much lower in this manual test than for the data provided by the weighing
    lysimeter. So, the sampling time was prolonged to minimise the time measurement
    error and, thus, to increase the obtained volume to minimise mistakes in the measurements.
    Nonetheless, this lower precision may have led to the observed differences; thus,
    the weighing system is believed to operate suitably. On the other hand, the values
    of the Kc coefficient lysimeter in the broccoli test using the standard weighing
    lysimeter were compared with the theoretical Kc obtained for this crop with a
    weighing lysimeter in the studies of Rubino et al. [43] and Villalobos-Reyes et
    al. [44]. In general, the values obtained in our validation are similar to the
    values of these studies, which allows us to confirm that the measurements of the
    standard weighing lysimeter are valid for the main function for which it was designed,
    which is the control of the water balance of vegetable and herbaceous crops. The
    obtained results were also compared with the FAO-56 data [45], which show that
    the cultivation cycle proposed for broccoli (Table 11 of FAO-56 for these specific
    conditions) is 135 days. The cultivation cycle of the test carried out in this
    study was 82 days, so the cultivation stages proposed by FAO-56 were reduced proportionally.
    The Kc coefficients proposed by FAO-56 (Table 12 of FAO-56) were used, and they
    are similar to those obtained with the other two methods, which are reflected
    in Table 6 of FAO-56. These results can also confirm the validity of the measurements
    provided for the standard weighing lysimeter. In any case, in order to automate
    irrigation operations, it is more useful to derive the lysimeter data directly
    in litres per plant so that irrigation scheduling can be directly adjusted according
    to the real-time water use determinations without the need for separately computing
    the reference evapotranspiration. 5. Conclusions A weighing lysimeter that is
    supported by information and communication technologies can be an effective tool
    for achieving efficient water and nutrient management. The dimensions of the CT
    of the portable weighing lysimeter developed by the Agromotic Engineering and
    Sea Research Group (Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena, Spain) allow it to be
    used for the monitoring of practically all vegetable crops and, by extension,
    herbaceous crops, as it adapts to a wide range of production and mechanisation
    systems. The possibilities of manufacturing it with different resolutions at the
    same cost allow adaptations to be made to lysimetry stations for research (0.09
    mm resolution with 300 kg load cells) or to commercial lysimetry stations (0.15
    mm resolution with 500 kg load cells). The possibility of quantifying and qualifying
    deep percolation drainage—and even of taking deep percolation drainage samples—allows
    accurate management of not only crop irrigation, but also crop fertilisation.
    After analysing the CT’s weighing system, its performance was found to be suitable,
    and its results corresponded to reality. Therefore, this portable weighing lysimeter
    is suitable for accurately measuring the use of water and nutrients in crops.

    Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes modern technologies to provide valuable insights,
    treatment, operation management and decisions for quality crop production. The
    combination of Internet of Things (IoT) with wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
    the enabler technologies that contributes in making precision agriculture a reality.
    Features such as cost-effective monitoring, collection and wireless transmission
    of real-time data to facilitate decision-making directives, makes IoT and WSN
    perfect candidates for precision agriculture. PA is characterized by the spatial
    variations and the incessant dynamic changes of the environmental aspects as it
    varies from one field to another. Aspects such as soil, temperature, drainage,
    humidity, water and vegetation strongly affect crop growth and production. Although
    farmers and agriculturists are always aware of these factors, they were not able
    to quantitatively measure these environmental variations, predict outcomes and
    proactively take the appropriate actions. Various measurements readings provide
    useful guidelines to avoid water stress by projecting irrigation schedules improve
    production efficiency, product quality, and reduce the environmental impact. It
    is noteworthy that in such environments, the need for context-sensitive assistance
    and support that can autonomously plan timely directive actions and pre-emptive
    guidelines becomes a real vital necessity. Within the PA domain the approach will
    make the most of the WSN technology to provide services, expertise guidelines
    and farming relevant-information and hence will radically transform the way agriculture-related
    services are conceived and delivered. This paper presents a novel architecture
    that provides efficient means and decision-making mechanisms geared towards maximizing
    production and profits while taking into consideration the optimal utilization
    of various natural and artificial farming resources in precision agriculture.
    The architecture models PA entities as autonomous agents that collaborate to monitor
    soil, crops and climate in a farm field, and hence, provide timely decisions to
    facilitate real-time agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilizer and
    pesticide application, for specific parts of a field proactively and in real time.
    Given the open, non-deterministic, and the dynamic nature of the entities participating
    in PA activities require the ability to change configuration according to their
    roles such as agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and Arborists.
    Moreover, farmers and agricultural personnel need spontaneous answers to various
    questions that are usually susceptible to a conjecture and speculation and prone
    to very intuitive analysis. It is clear that the design and implementation of
    solutions within distributed, open and heterogenous milieus such as the PA environments
    require a new modeling paradigm, integration architectures, and reliable uninterrupted
    self-configurable services. Such paradigm must describe the organization of the
    entities within the PA environment and the interconnection among them. Moreover,
    it must implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate the various agriculture
    operations through managing the activities to enable the coordination amongst
    various PA entities and support the ad hoc and automated configurations. Given
    the aforementioned characteristics of the PA environment, agent-orientation is
    a suitable design paradigm as it provides the ability to monitor and coordinate
    PA tasks among services by providing adequate interaction mechanisms. Such paradigm
    enables modeling the nature of the PA environment being open, distributed, and
    heterogeneous environments in which an agent operates as part of a community of
    systems, as well as, human users. In this work, the notion of agent-hood is defined
    as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that captures, supports and implements
    features at a high level of abstraction (knowledge level), which is useful for
    the PA environment. These features are classified as primary features such as
    rationality and coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and
    learning. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2, presents the evolution of
    the agriculture domain with the evolvement of technology, Sect. 3, presents agriculture
    4.0 conceptual model, Sect. 4, provides a review of enabler technologies and existing
    related approaches, Sect. 5, presents details of the a multi-agent architecture
    for PA, Sect. 6, presents the architecture and the necessary means and decision-making
    mechanisms that are geared towards the optimal utilization of natural and artificial
    farming resources in precision agriculture, Sect. 7, presents a prototype implementation
    using JADE (Java Agent Development platform) to support monitoring and control
    capabilities in precision agriculture environments, Sect. 8, provides a conclusion
    and discussion. 1.1 Agriculture Evolution The practice of agriculture existed
    since ancient days where human nurtured lands and raised animals to survive. With
    the evolvement of technology, the agriculture domain has been adopting the existence
    of the current technology and evolved from manual processes to automated ones.
    Figure 1 presents the evolution of the Agriculture 1.0 to the current existence
    of Agriculture 4.0 based on the industrial evolution. Traditional agriculture1.0
    relied on simple tools, manpower, and animal forces with low productivity. In
    the 19th century, with industrial evolution of steam engines, the use of machinery
    that is operated by farmers in agriculture 2.0, as well as the use of chemicals.
    Fig. 1. Evolution of agriculture with the industrial evolution Full size image
    This allowed for an increase in productivity of farm operations, however, it brought
    to the agriculture domain other issues related to the field contaminations, destruction
    to the eco-environment, and waste of natural resources. In the 20th century, the
    evolution of computing with computer programs and robotics enabled the agricultural
    machines to perform farming operations efficiently and intelligently, and hence,
    the 3rd agricultural evolution (Agriculture 3.0). This allowed in the reduction
    of chemical usage by optimizing the use of machinery, as well as, the improvement
    in the precision of irrigation. Current technologies and techniques within the
    fourth industrial revolution such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) allowed
    for more improvements to the agriculture domain and the existence of Agriculture
    4.0. Such technologies and techniques provide significant improvements within
    the agriculture domain in relation to the operation and the production. The work
    in [1] utilized IoT and WSN to optimize the production efficiency through efficient
    use of energy and water, as well as on maximizing on the agriculture quality,
    minimizing the impact on the environment. Moreover, the use of machine learning
    techniques in [19] to provide rich recommendations and insights for farmers to
    make adequate decisions within the agriculture domain. Other works looked into
    the efficient use of water for irrigation by utilizing IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing
    [2, 20]. This paper explores the Agriculture 4.0 and the development of the smart
    system and devices using the multi-agent system paradigm with the support of the
    current existing technologies such the IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing. 1.2 Agriculture
    4.0 Conceptual Model The conceptual model presents the required layer to deliver
    on agriculture 4.0 which enables precision agriculture. Figure 2 shows the architecture
    with the essential layer. The following subsections elaborate on the main functionalities
    of each layer and its contributions to enable the current agriculture 4.0. Fig.
    2. Agriculture 4.0 conceptual model Full size image Physical Layer. The current
    Industry 4.0 requires the definition of any object into the physical space and
    the digital space. The physical layer consists of domain related sensors (such
    as moisture sensor), transducers, and micro controllers/servers. The sensors provide
    the electrical signal readings within the agriculture environment. The electrical
    signals with the transducers are then shifted, scaled, and/or amplified with the
    micro controller/server digital, analog, and serial communication ports. Some
    decisions could be made with the aid of the micro controller/server device at
    the edge. such decision could be related to the operation of some of the resources
    related to the agriculture environment such as the irrigation system. The collected
    data from the physical layer is transmitted through the agriculture communication
    network layer through the supported protocols for the purpose of data storage
    and processing. Communication Layer. This layer is to make use of the adequate
    communication protocols and technologies in the transmission of the collected
    data from the sensor devices within the agriculture domain. This is an essential
    layer that provides the ability to connect the physical resources (in the physical
    layer) into the digital space. The digital space usually does not exist within
    the same network as the physical location of the farm, and hence, this requires
    access to the Wide Area Network (WAN). This can be either wired or wireless. Wireless
    communication network has been around for decades and has evolved from the first-generation
    to the current fifth generation of mobile communication network. Data Collection
    and Storage Layer. This layer provides the ability to collect, aggregate, and
    model the data captured from the physical layer. This data provides the ability
    for the control layer to provide the adequate decisions based on the collected
    agriculture data from the farmlands. The aggregated data may involve current collected
    data, as well as, historical data, depending on the model generated. Data from
    the agriculture domain can be either structured or semi-structured. Control Layer.
    This layer provides the ability to manage and decide upon specific criteria within
    the agriculture domain such as increasing productivity, allocating resources effectively,
    adapting to climate changes, and avoid food wastage. the layer contains Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) that provides the ability to provide the right decision
    as the right time depending on the implemented criteria. The DSS may utilize specific
    design paradigm and techniques for the agriculture domain such as Agent Oriented
    (AO) design paradigm and machine learning approaches that utilized current and
    historical data from the data collection and storage layer. Application Layer.
    This Layer Provides the Ability for the End User Within the Precision Agriculture
    to Interact with the System. The Layer Provides the Web Portal with the Exposed
    Services and Functionalities. Security Layer. This is an Essential Layer Since
    Each of the Aforementioned Layer Can Be Vulnerable to Various Malicious Attacks.
    Agriculture 4.0 Solutions Must Implement Security Practices to Protect the Full
    Environment from Information Disclosure, as Well as from Unauthorized Access,
    Improper Usage, Modification, or Destruction of Resources and Services. The Goal
    of the Security Layer is to Safeguard the PA Assets from Any Vulnerability Risks,
    Provide Confidentiality and Ensure the Integrity and the Overall Intrinsic Service
    Availability. These Goals Are Supported Through the Use of Authentication, Authorization,
    and Auditing Processes. 2 Enabling Technologies for Precision Agriculture With
    the rapid advancement in information technology, tremendous effort was devoted
    to developing new technological venues and design paradigms such as cloud computing,
    ubiquitous computing, and the context-aware computing in many application domains.
    Traditional agricultural management and processing methods need to be complemented
    by innovative sensing and driving technologies and state of the art technologies.
    Current trends of Agriculture 4.0 adopted innovative design and modelling paradigms
    as well as AI-based technologies. Precision agriculture is one of the promising
    application domains in which several technologies such as adaptive planning and
    scheduling, pattern recognition, neuron networks and machine learning models and
    methods, big data and predictive analytics were proposed [3, 9, 14, 25, 35]. Although
    more complex definitions exist, it was claimed that term of PA was first coined
    in 1997 by the US House of Representatives, in which the PA was defined as “an
    integrated information- and production-based farming system that is designed to
    increase long term, site-specific and whole farm production efficiency, productivity
    and profitability while minimizing unintended impacts on wildlife and the environment”.
    Within this context, Precision Agriculture is viewed as a farming management concept
    based upon monitoring, computing and responding to variability either in crops
    and produces or in aspects of animal rearing and cultivation [6]. While the focus
    of some definitions was impacted by the modern technical approaches on climate
    change, such as climate smart agriculture, for which the definition of the PA
    was aimed to develop the structural policies and the proper techniques that will
    achieve sustainable agricultural development to achieve food security under climate
    change. Other definitions envisioned that PA was not only restricted to the cropping
    systems per-se, but to include the entire agricultural production system such
    as animal industries, fisheries and forestry. Other approaches were proposed in
    the context-aware computing and grid computing based architecture [7, 17]. However,
    the main focus of these paradigms was geared towards the automation of collaboration
    activities and computation on a global scale. Several solutions were proposed
    to support agricultural activities and domain services that use real-time sensing
    networks for site sprinkle irrigation and control of watering via Bluetooth wireless
    technology [5, 11, 12, 18, 23]. Other approaches proposed several ways of controlling
    infertility through sensing capabilities and hence, the increase of soil fertility
    [13, 16]. Some of the existing approaches provide decision-based monitoring architecture
    for pesticide control and disease monitoring prediction that address climate change
    and hence, predict rampant pest outbreaks and diseases [6, 29, 30]. Observing
    climate and soil relative parameters such as humidity, temperature and plants
    moisture are used as vital indicators to the development of the disease in potato
    fields was exhibited with the utilization of wireless sensors. Phenomena such
    as the Internet of Things [31] and Big Data as well as the utilization of Cloud
    Computing resources and Artificial Intelligence techniques are gaining a prominent
    acceptance and expected to leverage the development of various precision agriculture
    application [32]. Massive volumes of various data can be captured, analyzed and
    thus used for better automated control and decision-making. Wolfert provides a
    comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of big data applications in smart
    farming and identifies the related socio-economic challenges [34]. In spite of
    the prominent rapid development of computer technology, field measurements of
    agricultural environment parameters and spatial data collection still depend highly
    on human intervention, stationary sensors and very traditional data repositories
    such as data loggers, paper-based records and static storage sources which are
    labor-intensive and prone to very vital errors. In this work, Precision Agriculture
    is viewed as: an abstraction level at which the agricultural environment is viewed
    as a coherent universe that provides coordination solutions to a variety of agricultural
    entities in open distributed and heterogeneous settings. 3 Multi-agent Architecture
    for Precision Agriculture Farmers and agricultural personnel entities such as
    agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and arborists within a
    PA environment need spontaneous answers to various questions that are usually
    susceptible to a lot of conjecture and speculation and prone to very intuitive
    analysis. The main challenge in PA is how to adopt an adequate technology that
    provides means and mechanisms to improve field-level management with regards to,
    crop monitoring, farming practices and crop needs. Multi-agent design paradigm
    provides and improved integration architectures, and services for monitoring and
    control of the PA environment. Moreover, the multiagent design paradigm provides
    the ability to implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate various agriculture
    operations and thus enables the interaction amongst various PA entities and supports
    the ad hoc and automated configurations. In the traditional point-to-point interaction
    patterns, entities engage directly with each other to satisfy controlled and directed
    coordination. It is clearly obvious that in such configuration is both inflexible
    and computationally expensive. For instance, there is no separation of concerns
    and responsibilities between the computation elements and the incurred required
    interactions and coordination. The lack of a distinct medium that deals solely
    with the coordination activities, imposes a considerable overhead on the entities
    in which they have to carry out the “interaction work” themselves to satisfy common
    or local task, in addition to their fundamental computational responsibilities.
    As an alternative, a capability-based coordination approach for interaction is
    a favorable and effective choice in which entities does not need to be concerned
    with how the interaction is performed or done. In this work, we consider the agent
    technology as the applicable medium that supports the coordination approach that
    is based on the capabilities of the agents within the PA environment. The notion
    of agent-hood is defined as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that implements
    features within the PA environment at a high-level of abstraction at the knowledge
    level. These features are classified as primary features such as rationality and
    coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and learning. The multi-agent
    architecture for PA takes into consideration the creation of a smart environment
    with the ability to combine distributed information sources that may have different
    schemas. Furthermore, it provides a level of assistance to agriculturists through
    the ability to integrate distributed multi-modal sensors and actuators, and further
    analyze the integrated information. Such heterogeneity of the PA environment adds
    burden on fulfilling the interoperability among the different PA participants.
    Many semantic solutions were proposed in the literature in order to solve the
    problem of data heterogeneity and providing interoperability between the devices,
    sensors and relevant entities in PA, such as semantic annotations, linked sensor
    data, and ontologies. In addition, different information models might use different
    ontologies languages in terms of representations, which make the process of the
    semantic interoperability a complicated activity. Thus, our presented agent-based
    architecture defines an ontological view and representation that act as an explicit
    semantic ontology, which consequently provide meaningful integration processes
    such as matching, mapping, and aligning as well as enabling the interoperability
    among the PA entities. 3.1 Modeling the Precision Agriculture Smart Environment
    The architecture for a smart PA environment can be viewed as a multi-layered system.
    The nodes of a WSN are composed of sensors that collect data from the agriculture
    field. Sensors may also get data from other nodes by exchanging messages. The
    data obtained from the WSN describes how properties vary within agriculture fields.
    This information is then used to analyze and predict values that provide efficient
    control of important farming operations. The results of the interventions are
    monitored, recorded and used as a starting point to initiate the next crop cycle.
    From the collection and intelligent analysis of these parameters can then plan
    interventions such as fertilizers, irrigation and plant protection treatments
    tailored to the actual needs of the crop, which is implemented only when necessary.
    The positive effects of a site-specific management of agricultural practices affect
    not only the quantity and quality of products, but also a significant reduction
    in production costs and more effective action to protect the environment by reducing
    the use of pesticides. This approach also allows identifying and evaluating the
    risk indices plant pathology in order to implement appropriate strategies of “integrated
    pest management”. Figure 3 shows the proposed PA environment as a collection of
    software agents that interact autonomously and cooperatively analyze information,
    generate valuable decisions, and accordingly provide agricultural directives and
    guidelines. Fig. 3. Smart environment monitoring and control architecture for
    PA Full size image Agent-orientation provides the ability to develop entities
    that are able to detect and react to the nature of PA dynamic stimuli. Agent-hood
    features such as autonomy, reactivity and mobility drive certain desirable similarities
    with WSN. These similarities can be summarized as follow: Reactivity: Agents are
    able to detect and react to events, and external stimuli. Ability to work asynchronously:
    The agents come into operation, upon receipt of a stimulus. In PA, this feature
    favors the implementation of techniques to ensure that messages are asynchronously
    delivered and managed over the network. Autonomy: Agents have control over their
    actions and the various internal states without an intervention of humans. In
    a PA environment, this condition is very useful, since if any node in the network
    fails, the network must be able to meet its target objectives without impacting
    the overall common goals such as sustainability, availability and robustness.
    Communication capability: Agents need to interact and communicate to achieve their
    goals. The communication component defines the language and the set of protocols
    of exchanging messages. This ability is reflected in the distribution of information
    obtained from sensors or from other network nodes. Coordination and Cooperation.
    The agent must be able to perform tasks and coordinate their interaction through
    collaboration with other agents. The coordination defines both the system structure
    and the Interaction mechanism and the cooperation defines the policies that govern
    the interaction. Mobility: It is the ability of an agent to move around a specific
    network. The deployed node is in mobility to either track or get the data from
    a corresponding PA field. Agent Architecture. The agents of the PA environment
    are built on the foundation of Collaborative Intelligence Rational (CIR) agent
    architecture with the focus on utilizing the model to capture the participating
    agent’s behavior towards achieving the desirable goal. Each agent has two main
    components: 1) Knowledge Component, 2) Capability Component. Each component is
    designed according to the agent’s specific role [21]. The knowledge component
    consists of the following: The agent’s self-knowledge based on its role within
    the PA environment. The knowledge of the other agents within the PA environment.
    The specific goals to be satisfied within the PA environment. Possible solutions
    to satisfy each goal within the PA environment. The local history of the PA environment
    that consists of all possible local solutions for an agent at any given time.
    Agent’s desires commitments and intentions toward achieving each goal within the
    PA environment. The capability component consists of the following: The domain
    actions which contains the possible set of actions that impacts the state of the
    PA environment when executed. The communication where each agent within the PA
    environment sends and receives messages. The problem solver which consists of
    reasoning algorithms that are executed based on the role of the agent to satisfy
    its goal. The generated solution from the problem solver within the agent depends
    on the aforementioned knowledge component. From Fig. 3, we can observe the interdependency
    challenge among the Ontology Agent, Personal Assistant Agent, and the Gateway
    Agent. Interdependency is defined as a goal-relevant interrelationship between
    actions performed by various participating agents [22]. The coordination mechanisms
    reduce and resolve the issues associated with interdependencies. Furthermore,
    the agent’s interaction module identifies the type of interdependencies that exists
    within the PA environment and accordingly utilizes the suitable interaction device.
    The interaction devices are categorized as: Contract-based, includes the assignment
    device; Negotiation-based, includes resource scheduling, conflict resolution,
    synchronization, and redundancy avoidance devices [10]. The interdependency within
    the PA domain is classified as capability interdependency and the interaction
    device is the “assignment” device. The main function of the assignment device
    is to resolve problems associated with capability interdependencies. The basic
    characteristics of the assignment device are problem specifications and evaluation
    parameters. With reducing complexity in achieving a goal as the agent’s main objective,
    a solution can be selected based on the goal quality. The basic characteristics
    of the assignment device are problem specifications, evaluation parameters, and
    the sub-processes. The problem specifications might include, for example, the
    request, the desired-satisfying time, and the expiration time. A collection of
    basic components comprises the structure of the agent model and represents its
    capabilities. The proposed architecture defines three types of rational intelligent
    agents, namely: The Personal Assistant Agent (PAA), the Ontology Agent (OA) and
    the Gateway Agent (GA). Personal Assistant Agent (PAA): possesses the capability
    of three major components: 1) the communication component, 2) the analysis data
    component, and 3) the decision-making component. The role of the PAA is to formulate
    the agriculturists’ request and collects the various climates relevant readings
    obtained from the PA environment. Upon receiving these readings, the PAA analyses
    the information and determines the ideal settings and the possible recommended
    set of needed actions (for example, if the humidity or temperature exceeds/less
    than a predefined value, an action alert will be generated). In order for the
    PAA to capture the other agents’ model, it has to be able to communicate only
    about facts that can be represented and expressed in the defined ontology view
    and representation. In other words, agents need to adhere to the ontological semantic
    and structure. Moreover, in order for the PAA to fulfill this capability, it asks
    the Ontology Agent (OA) for the definitions and possibly requests translation
    of agricultural terms and concepts inherent is a specific request. Ontologies
    provide support for semantic data and semantic integration. However, there are
    many cases where organizational, cultural, or infrastructural constraints hide
    or even disallow the adoption of such semantic artifacts, in other words, there
    is a lack of explicit ontologies. Ontology Agent (OA): captures and defines the
    set of agriculture concepts, set of activities and domain events. It provides
    various abstract levels of domain knowledge within the PA related applications
    and hence derives the decision–making process. The corresponding ontology specifies
    a formal representation for the different agricultural concepts (semantic ans
    syntax) and the different relationships amongst these concepts. This ontology
    must be agreed and understood by the agent community that constitute the PA environment
    (or at least among its part) in order to enable each agent to understand messages
    from other participants. The formal precision agriculture ontology presented in
    this work adopts a similar structure defined by Goumopoulos [11] that can be formally
    represented as follows $$ PA_{Onto} = \\left( {Ont_{Des} , PA_{Concept} ,PA_{Relation}
    , Axioms} \\right) $$ The \\(Ont_{Des}\\) is a tuple that consists of the following
    elements: \\({ }Ont_{Des} \\equiv \\langle OntID,{ }DevId,{ }ver,{ }md{ }\\rangle\\),
    where \\({ }OntID\\) is the ontology name, \\(DevId\\) defines the device name,
    \\(ver\\) specifies the time of relevant to ontology creation and \\(md{ }\\)
    represents the source and the purpose of the ontology metadata information. The
    \\(PA_{Concept} { }\\) represents the PA set of concepts and terminologies; \\(PA_{Relation}\\)
    defines both the set of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships between
    the PA concepts and \\(Axioms\\) are these assertions (including rules) in a logical
    form. The representation of the PA Ontology captures the knowledge of various
    agricultural resources in terms of their classifications and descriptions. In
    this work, the knowledge representation of ontology adheres to the five-elements
    ontology approach, which can be formally, represents as follows: $$ Ont \\equiv
    \\left\\{ {C, Attr^{c} , Rel^{c} , Attr^{Rel} , H^{c} } \\right\\} $$ The \\(C\\)
    defines the set of agricultural concepts and terminologies; \\(Attr^{c}\\) is
    the set of all the possible states defined by the attributes of each concept;
    \\(Rel^{c}\\) is the set of relationships among the ontological agricultural concepts;
    \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) defines the various attributes of specific relationship along
    with the applicable multiplicities. All dependencies can be further viewed in
    terms of a generalization (is-a) or aggregation (part-whole) relationships; \\(H^{c}\\)
    specifies the concept hierarchy and its sub-elements. For example, the potato’s
    insecticide control ontology shall adhere to the aforementioned representation
    in which the elements will be defined as follows: \\(C\\) = {Plant, Insects, Pests,
    Insecticide, potato, Blister beetle, Aphid, Grubs, Russell Potato, White Potato,
    moisture, hydrometer} \\(Attr^{c}\\) = {(Name, Plant), (Reading, Moisture), (Poisoning
    percentage, Insecticide), (Color, Grubs)} \\(Rel^{c}\\) = {Kill (Insecticide,
    Aphid)} \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) = {((Name, (is-a), Plant)), ((Nutrients, (is-composed-of),
    ingredients))} \\(H^{c} \\) = {(Potato, Solanaceae), (Blister beetle, Insect),
    (Aphid, pests), (Herbicides, Insecticide)}. The Gateway Agent (GA): has the role
    of information gathering that receives sensors’ readings based on pre-set sampling
    intervals. For each sensor set, the GA is assigned the task of retrieving readings
    from the underlying scattered sensors based on the defined ontology. The GA monitors
    the status of the sensors and performs checking operations and set the data collection
    frequency. It is noteworthy that the PA environment encompasses different kinds
    of sensors with various specifications. The GA supports on-demand reading delivery
    as well as the full pre-defined measurement lifecycle. The knowledge component
    of the GA includes the sensors model available in the PA environment starting
    from the registration of physical sensor nodes as well as the addition or removal
    of a physical sensor. The knowledge component also contains a description of the
    sensors measuring capability, the agricultural terms understood and the description
    of the relationship between the concepts. The domain knowledge provides mappings
    models for transforming a domain queries into a set of queries to the appropriate
    target sensors. All these models need to be stated in an expressive common language
    that can allow capturing all the relevant distinctions amongst various terms and
    concepts as per the aforementioned ontology view. The gateway agent’s capability
    component identifies, dynamically selects the appropriate sensor and accordingly
    retrieves the relevant readings. Query processing requires developing a plan for
    obtaining the requested data. It is noteworthy, that the gateway agent also acts
    as a firewall and a proxy server to prevent unauthorized access to the private
    agricultural field network. 4 Agent-Based PA Implementation Directives The proposed
    architecture is validated by implementing the system of the PA in a real environment.
    The implementation of the system is viewed as a collection of tiers and layers
    with various autonomous agents that can act independently and cooperate in providing
    services and synergize agricultural environmental and spatial data according to
    mutual interests. The model provides querying ability and coordination activities
    that enhance the overall connectivity of distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous
    WSN information sources in PA. In this work the Mote-View WSN package [4] was
    used as the “client tier” application interface for control and monitoring supervision
    for a specific topology of wireless sensors deployment [33]. 4.1 Hardware Specifications
    Two types of sensors were used; namely: the (MEP410) for microclimate and ambient
    light monitoring, and (MEP510) sensor, in addition to a gateway (MIP520) [33].
    The sensors and the gateway are installed with the distance between the nodes
    is 3.5 m. Each WSN package contains of the following: Radio Platform (PR2400CA):
    the platform is based on a low-power microcontroller (AtmelATmega128L) and runs
    MoteWorks [24] that is an end-to-end platform for the creation of wireless sensor
    networks applications and the processing of simultaneous radio communications.
    Data Acquisition Board (MDA300CA): a compliant data acquisition board that can
    adopt various types of sensors. The board contains standard environmental measurements
    sensors such as ambient temperature, humidity, soil moisture, leaf wetness and
    atmospheric pressure. Sensor Node: Each sensor node consists of 2.4 GHz MICAz
    mote, MDA300CA data acquisition board, Irrometer Soil moisture sensor, atmospheric
    pressure sensor MPX4115A, and leaf wetness sensor. The board is managed and controlled
    by an operating system (TinyOS). TinyOS is an open-source operating system designed
    for low-power wireless devices [28] and event-driven programming language [8].
    Sink Node: The Sensor –System interface is supported by MIB510, which provides
    data transfer and allows aggregation of sensor network data on different computer
    platforms via an RS-232 serial programming interface. Additionally, the sensor
    node (MICAz) acts as a base station when assembled with the MIB510 interface board
    [8]. 4.2 Software Specifications The Mote-View software framework is used for
    managing, monitoring, and visualizing sensor network deployments. The modules
    within the Mote-View client are conceptually viewed as a multi-tier-based architecture
    in which four layers provide dedicated services (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4. MOTE-VIEW
    client-tier abstraction of sensor network data Full size image A Data Access Abstraction
    Layer (data layer), comprises the PostgreSQL relational database [26] and captures
    various system data such sensors readings, and environment corresponding surroundings
    information as well as a real-time measurements’ readings. The Node Status and
    Configuration Layer (Node Layer) manages all the relevant sensor configuration
    and gets updates upon successful events that are sent from the data layer; Calibration
    and Conversion Layer which provides calibration and data conversion service to
    the measured parameters and uses calibration coefficients raw data readings. The
    Presentation layer provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for to provide users
    of wireless sensor networks an end-to-end management and supervision of a specific
    sensor’s deployment. Each layer includes a plug-in capability for providing modular
    extensions. The Mote-View package consists of the following modules. MoteViews:
    it is software used for collecting data from the nodes in different fields. XSniffer:
    Monitors the 802.15.4 wireless network packets. MoteConfig: it is a Windows-based
    GUI utility for programming Motes. This utility provides an interface for configuring
    and downloading pre-compiled XMesh/TinyOS firmware applications onto Motes. Cygwin:
    is a command-line interface. 4.3 Experiment Environment Setting The proposed architecture
    was tested under experimental conditions and was meant as a proof-of-concept.
    Two rows of shallow trenches, one meter apart was dug and seed potatoes half (½)
    meter apart were planted accordingly, each seed location is characterized by a
    soil moisture sensor. The temperature sensor was installed halfway between the
    two rows and mounds it against the plants, burying the stems halfway. A total
    of seven sensors (Mica2 motes) were organized in a parcel for monitoring the crop
    and recording the temperature and relative humidity. In order to maintain an effective
    network connectivity and reliable communication, the sensors were installed at
    a height of 50 cm. It is noteworthy that during the potatoes flowering, the radio
    range was dramatically affected and thus manual adjustments for the sensor’s heights
    were required. All the system settings, readings and corresponding sensors data
    were captured in multiple databases by using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The implementation
    utilizes the JADE platform [15]. JADE is a software framework geared towards developing
    agent applications in compliance with the FIPA specifications for multi-agent
    systems. JADE supports a distributed environment of agent containers and allow
    several agents to execute concurrently. The role of the PAA agent is to formulate
    the service requests, sends it out to all gateway agents and collects the required
    information, evaluates the received data, determines the applicable decision accordingly
    and notifies the corresponding agent about the outcomes. The knowledge component
    includes the agent’s self-model, model of gateway and ontology agents, and the
    local history. The main capabilities of the PAA agent include communication, reasoning
    and domain actions components. The PAA problem-solver component incorporates the
    Jade behavior classes (simpleBehaviors and cyclicBehaviors) that fulfill tasks
    such as registration with the directory facilitator (DF) service and to handle
    the various incoming messages and requests. The cyclic behavior class equips the
    PAA agent with ability to check for service results that have been sent by the
    gateway agents. The communication component inherits the jade.Core.Agent and jade.lang.acl.ACLMessage
    existing classes of the jade platform. These classes enable constructing ACL messages
    by utilizing the various FIPA performatives such as REQUEST, INFORM, INFORM-DONE,
    and QUERY-IF. The messages exchanged in the interaction contain a set of one or
    more message elements. The elements vary according to the coordination scenario;
    however, the only mandatory element in all the ACL messages is the performative.
    A message might additionally include the sender name or signature, the receiver
    and the possibly a content. Agents are able to get contents and set the content
    of a particular message by overriding the methods setContent and getContent. The
    coordination component uses the FipaContractNetBehaviour for the interaction and
    negotiation patterns based on the soliciting approach as in the case of the contract-net
    approach which depends on (1) the modeling approach for other agent’s capabilities,
    and (2) the solicitation approach for the local schedule and workload of other
    agents. To capture the PA ontology and to represent the domain knowledge, the
    Protégé [27] extendible framework is used in this work. The use of Protégé permits
    exporting the ontology in various formats such as OWL (Web Ontology Language)
    and RDF (Resource Description Framework). The JADE Abstract Ontology is implanted
    using the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology. For Frames ontologies, the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology
    is inherited and for the OWL ontologies, the OWLSimpleJADEAbstractOntoloigy package
    is imported. 5 Conclusions Precision agriculture is a new paradigm that is geared
    to accommodate the increasing demand for food and nutrient using state-of-the-art
    technologies. These technologies have emerged as a proper choice not only to make
    the agricultural activities simpler, but cheaper to collect and apply data, and
    to adapt to changing environmental conditions while using the resources most efficiently.
    The proposed agent-based monitoring and control architecture promotes innovative
    model that can protect field crops, manage and control real-time agricultural
    activities in a novel modern approach. The timely decisions exhibited by the modcel
    are very desirable fundamental directives for optimizing production activities
    of precision agriculture users. The architecture depicts a a promising trend in
    moving from an intensive-labor and time-consuming work to an automated, real-time,
    and cost-effective monitoring, control and decision-making architecture that can
    enhance the PA prospective and objectives. By utilizing the Agent-Oriented paradigm,
    the Precision Agriculture domain environment is modelled at a high level of abstraction
    and viewed collectively as a coherent universe of interacting and collaborative
    agents that provide high degree of decentralization of capabilities, which is
    the key to system scalability and extensibility. The ontology model specifies
    formal schemata and intelligent view for developing and representing efficient
    of agricultural knowledge across various agriculture information sources. It is
    noteworthy that the number of physical parameters that need to be observed and
    monitored can be captured by introducing relevant sensor types as long as these
    attached sensors are registered and initiated with the Gateway Agent (GA). Furthermore,
    the model can accommodate control-based sensors for actuators and motors which
    can be remotely switched on and off to perform automatic activities such as irrigation
    and pesticide spraying activities. The utilization of the WSN technology and the
    proposed model was realized and tested under lab conditions where physical parameters
    (such as soil temperature and soil moisture) can be easily captured and transmitted
    for further decision making. References Blackmore, S., Stout, B., Wang, M., Runov,

    Use ModelingWater ManagementFAIR data 1. Introduction Irrigation scheduling is
    becoming an increasingly crucial decision-making task whose goal is to achieve
    effective and efficient use of water (Saggi and Jain, 2022). The crop quality
    and yield are significantly dependent on the amount of water and timing. The objective
    of irrigation scheduling is to apply an adequate amount of water at the right
    time to a specific crop. However, according to a survey by the US Department of
    Agriculture, more than 75% of irrigation scheduling methods applied by farmers
    in the US are based on the Checkbook method (Vellidis et al., 2016), and the condition
    of crops such as visual observations, crop calendars and observing what the neighbors
    are doing (USDA, 2017). Inefficient irrigation scheduling methods may result in
    over-irrigation or under-irrigation. Consequently, water scarcity, nutrient leaching,
    and increased soil salinity if groundwater is used for irrigation can be observed
    in over-irrigated regions or yield an economic loss in under-irrigated farms.
    Science- and technology-based irrigation scheduling approaches, as opposed to
    the Checkbook method or the condition of crop method, may boost crop profit while
    reducing environmental consequences by limiting crop water stress (Zhang et al.,
    2021). Model-based crop water demand assessment falls under three categories,
    deterministic methods, process-based models, and machine learning (ML) methods.
    Deterministic methods such as FAO-56 calculate irrigation water demand based on
    crop evapotranspiration approaches (Allen et al., 2005). Process-based models
    such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Aquacrop, Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator
    (APSIM) usually determine crop water requirement by simulating biophysical processes
    leading to plants’ growth in the soil-plant-atmosphere system using mathematical
    formulations of those processes. ML models, on the other hand, are data-driven,
    they estimate irrigation needs by learning the hidden function that relates input
    weather and soil data to crop water demands. All techniques have been applied
    in irrigation scheduling for different crops in various regions across the globe.
    However, process-based models are highly sensitive to uncertainties associated
    with physical processes such as initial and boundary conditions and spatiotemporal
    variability of soil moisture conditions than are deterministic and ML models (Karandish
    and Šimůnek, 2016, Gumiere et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020). Consequently, process-based
    models need extensive and constant calibration as new data are generated to accurately
    compute irrigation needs. Furthermore, process-based models are more suitable
    for irrigation planning than for real-time irrigation decision-making (Gu et al.,
    2020). Process-based models lack a way to explicitly enhance real-time soil moisture
    prediction by incorporating weather forecasts or feedback from soil moisture sensors.
    For instance, SWAT has shown consistent overestimation of the irrigation amount
    when used for irrigation scheduling which compromises the model’s accuracy in
    automated irrigation control (Sun and Ren, 2014, Maier and Dietrich, 2016). Fortunately,
    real-time irrigation prediction and scheduling can be achieved thanks to technological
    developments such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that enhance data availability
    and the increased computational power enabling the operation of ML models in real-time.
    Examples of such applications include an irrigation system developed by Glória
    et al. (2021) to attain the best water-saving schedule using real-time data, and
    smart irrigation strategies that predict irrigation water use using several ML
    algorithms (see Tace et al., 2022). The application of ML in irrigation scheduling
    promoted agricultural productivity and water use efficiency (Hunsaker et al.,
    2005, Karasekreter et al., 2013, Nachankar et al., 2018, Nawandar and Satpute,
    2019, Jamroen et al., 2020, Jimenez et al., 2020). With novel data collection
    techniques, the quantity of available data at a finer spatial-temporal scale,
    also known as big data, has increased in an unprecedented way (Donratanapat et
    al., 2020, Huang et al., 2019). Big data can be leveraged to find appropriate
    solutions for the problems faced by farmers (García et al., 2020), such as water
    shortage, and crop and cost management (Elijah et al., 2018). ML technologies
    can be leveraged to use big data for irrigation water use simulation. Indeed,
    the integration of ML technologies with big data enables irrigation estimation
    to be undertaken in more intelligent and efficient ways hence ensuring water sustainability
    for the growing world’s population (Sharma et al., 2021). Recent studies have
    investigated how ML can benefit the agricultural sectors by improving irrigation
    systems (Nemali and van Iersel, 2006, Liu et al., 2021). ML has been used to improve
    traditional ways of carrying out agricultural activities such as irrigation control
    and management (Tseng et al., 2018, Dahane et al., 2020, Torres-Sanchez et al.,
    2020). Indeed, ML has been employed to build intelligent data-driven models and
    provide the best solution for irrigation scheduling by learning the hidden relationship
    in datasets. The outcomes of the ML irrigation model can benefit farmers in numerous
    ways. ML algorithms can predict irrigation water requirements based on the study
    of evaporation processes through collected data and determine soil moisture variations
    over time. The soil moisture content can then be used as an indicator of when
    and how much to irrigate. This information can provide early intelligence to farmers
    to enhance their irrigation decisions. Currently, there are several ML methods
    available to predict irrigation water demand that have been applied in different
    farm settings. Liou et al. (2001) were among the first scholars who applied ML
    models, i.e., an error-propagation learning back-propagation neural network, to
    estimate soil moisture from simulated brightness temperature. In a sequence, Dibike
    et al. (2001) demonstrated the potential of support vector machine (SVM) to outperform
    artificial neural network (ANN) in remote sensing image classification and regression
    problems. Gill et al. (2006) used SVM to predict soil moisture in four to seven
    days ahead of time using historical data with forecasts that were quite comparable
    to the actual soil moisture measurements. In another study, Shrestha and Shukla
    (2015) utilized SVM to estimate crop evapotranspiration using lysimeter-based
    measurements for vine and erect crops to train the model. They found that the
    SVM model surpassed ANN and boosted the accuracy of FAO-56 crop evapotranspiration
    estimates by 4%. Soil moisture measurements became possible with the emergence
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the availability of enhanced and more accessible
    soil sensing and field communication technology (Kamienski et al., 2018, García
    et al., 2020). Major drawbacks of ML algorithms, however, are massive data requirement,
    black-boxiness, uncertainty associated with simulation(Tabas and Samadi, 2022),
    automatically deducing the features, and optimally tuning them for the desired
    outcomes (e.g., Windheuser et al., 2023). Overfitting and bias are two other common
    deficiencies in ML algorithms. Overfitting is a major issue in ML and occurs when
    a model cannot generalize well on unseen data during the testing period. Over-fitted
    models tend to capture all the trends in the data, including unavoidable noise
    on the training set, instead of learning the hidden relationship between features.
    The main causes of overfitting are noisy data, insufficient training data, and
    model complexities. In this review paper, we discuss existing opportunities to
    address these issues and provide a path for future ML research in irrigation decision-making.
    This review paper aims to (i) assess how ML has been used as an intelligent simulation
    model to promote water management in the irrigation sector, (ii) discuss the results
    of ML models applied in various agricultural water use simulation research, and
    (iii) highlight the limitations that hinder the effective performance of ML models
    in irrigation prediction and scheduling. By doing so, we discussed the applicability
    of various ML algorithms in irrigation management, articulated their weakness
    and strengths, and identified the knowledge gaps and the next steps to promote
    the application of these intelligent algorithms in irrigation scheduling. The
    remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief introduction
    to ML as well as the most used algorithms in irrigation prediction. Section 3
    presents surveyed studies that used ML approaches in irrigation-related studies.
    Section 4 presents existing limitations in the use of ML models and how they can
    be addressed, Section 5 highlights different ways to add physics into ML models,
    while Section 6 discusses major results from developed irrigation tools. Section
    7 draws major conclusion of the paper. 2. Machine learning modelling concepts
    ML, defined as \"the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically
    through experience and by using data\" (Mitchell, 2007), has been used in agriculture
    due to the increased availability of data and the need to improve traditional
    farming practices. IoT is an emerging technology that uses smart sensors and devices
    interconnected through the internet to collect data and transmit them to a server
    with no or limited human intervention. As such, it allows continuous monitoring
    and management of soil and climate conditions and promotes efficient farm management.
    ML and IoT enable big data collection and modeling, and farm machinery modernization
    that gives rise to precision agriculture, also known as smart farming. Precision
    agriculture is the use of up-to-date information technologies, smart devices,
    and software tools to support decision-making in agriculture (Pierce and Nowak,
    1999). It aims at increasing the farm’s profitability by reducing the cost of
    production while improving environmental sustainability. ML algorithms fall under
    three categories, as illustrated by Fig. 1: supervised learning, unsupervised
    learning, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. In supervised learning,
    the developed model uses information from labeled inputs and outputs to find the
    functional relationships between them. Supervised learning can be used to predict
    categorical output values in which case a classification algorithm is used, on
    the other hand, if the value to be predicted is numerical, a regression algorithm
    can be used. In the unsupervised learning category, the learning algorithm uses
    unlabelled datasets to find the pattern that maps inputs to outputs. RL uses an
    agent to make a decision by interacting with the environment aiming at finding
    proper actions that maximize rewards and minimize penalties through trial and
    error. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, is also illustrated in Fig. 1. DL models
    can abstract features from high dimensional time series datasets and use multiple
    layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input data.
    This review paper is mostly focused on broader ML models, even though some review
    examples of DL models for irrigation demand modeling are also provided. Download

    Different types of ML algorithms. Three key steps are followed in building ML
    models to perform prediction tasks (see Fig. 2). Firstly, the input data is pre-processed
    by carrying out data cleaning to remove noise and missing data using data transformation
    methods such as discretization or normalization. The model is then trained and
    calibrated with the training dataset to find the function that relates the inputs
    to the outputs by determining a set of parameters that give the best results (Mahesh,
    2018, Oden Technologies, 2023). After this process, a new dataset (validation
    dataset) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Once an overall satisfactory
    performance is achieved, the model can be tested on an unseen dataset, the performance
    of the testing period determines ML''s ability to accurately perform a task based
    on the learned experience. Supervised learning and RL are recently used for irrigation
    water use modeling which are discussed in the following sections. Download : Download

    of ML approaches for irrigation water use modelling. 2.1. Machine learning algorithms
    commonly used in irrigation scheduling Most ML algorithms for regression problems
    estimate a mapping function that can predict the output variables (Y) for new
    input data (X). Some popular examples of ML algorithms are Linear Regression,
    Random Forest (RF), Boosting Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, and Long Short-term
    Memory (LSTM). Here we briefly explain different ML models. Readers are referred
    to Kecman (2005), Kavitha et al. (2016), and Tabas and Samadi (2022) for more
    details on ML algorithms. 2.1.1. Random forest Inspired by the work of Amit and
    Geman (1997), Breiman (2001) introduced RF. RF is a collection of tree-structured
    classifiers {h(x, ѳk), k = 1,…} formed based on a set of input vectors (X = X1,
    X2, …, Xn) and random vectors (ѳk) sampled independently but with a similar distribution
    to find a prediction function (f(X)) that can accurately predict the variable
    of interest (Y). RF can be used to solve classification or regression problems.
    After multiple (k) runs, the majority vote of the predictions given by each tree
    is the answer for classification problems whereas the predictions'' average is
    considered the model output for regression problems. Fig. 3 illustrates the workflow
    of RF simulation. The accuracy of the prediction function is given by the loss
    function L (Y, f(X)) which is a measure of the closeness of f(X) to Y. Thus, the
    optimum prediction function minimizes the expected value of the loss function
    EXY (L, f(X)). Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The workflow of RF simulation. 2.1.2. Boosting classifiers
    Boosting is a type of ensemble method that builds a good performing model (strong
    learner) by adding up several models in an attempt to combine multiple simulations
    until an accurate prediction is achieved or a maximum number of models are added.
    This is done in a sequential learning process where each model learns from the
    errors of its predecessor and tries to correct them. Popular Boosting ensemble
    models include Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB).
    In the Adaboost, observations are weighted, and less weight is given to instances
    already well classified whereas those that are more difficult to classify are
    given more weight to be handled by new learners. GTB uses a loss function such
    as squared error to minimize the error as models are added up. 2.1.3. Long short-term
    memory LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) developed by Hochreiter
    and Schmidhuber (1997). Unlike the traditional RNN, LSTM networks allow information
    to persist, thus managing the problem of the vanishing gradient in the traditional
    RNN. The LSTM has a hidden state known as short-term memory and an additional
    cell state, which is the long-term memory. The main attribute of LSTM networks
    is that they can remember information for a long time. Fig. 4 illustrates the
    structure of an LSTM network. As illustrated, the information flow is regulated
    by three gates; the forget gate determines if the information from the previous
    time step should be kept or forgotten, the input gate learns new information from
    the current time step and adds it to the cell, and the output gate that transmits
    the updated information from the current time step to the next one. Download :

    Reinforcement learning algorithms RL is an ML approach where the algorithm learns
    how to map situations to actions by interacting with its environment to attain
    a goal. This continuous interaction with the environment forms a closed loop problem
    solving system where the selected actions depend on learned experience through
    a series of interactions with the environment and the rewards received per each
    action chosen (see Fig. 5). The goal of the RL algorithm is to maximize the cumulative
    rewards through the interactive feedback mechanism that differentiates RL from
    other ML algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. RL agent and its interaction with a physical environment
    (i.e., a farm system). RL uses a mathematical model, i.e., the Markov Decision
    Process (MDP), to solve a problem. MDP uses a property that enables the next state
    and reward to be computed given that the current state and action are known. More
    precisely, the agent interacts with the environment in a time sequence of discrete
    time steps. At each time step t, the agent receives the current state of the environment
    with S being the set of all possible states and then selects an action where represents
    actions that can be taken in state . Following the action taken, the agent will
    then be given a reward and the environment transits to a new state . The goal
    of the agent is to maximize the cumulative rewards received from the environment.
    The measure of the values of possible action “a” at state “s” pairs that can be
    taken by the algorithm is determined by a value function . This function can be
    optimized through a series of iterations to give the optimal state action pair
    that results in the highest reward at each time step. For complex environments
    with a high dimensional state-action space, the value function (Q-value) is not
    suitable for defining the reward of each pair. Consequently, a more advanced RL
    algorithm known as Deep Q-Network (DQN) consisting of a combination of Q-learning
    and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is used to solve such complex problems. Instead
    of determining the cumulative reward based on the value function table, DQN leverages
    DNN to approximate the Q-values, the network takes the environment state as input
    and predicts the Q-values for each action. Focusing on RL applications in irrigation
    water use simulation, researchers define the state as actual observations to determine
    a sequence of optimal irrigation that is related to a farm’s environment such
    as soil moisture, crop growth status, and weather conditions. The agent, which
    is the learner and decision maker, is represented by the irrigation system while
    actions are the various choices made by the agent on the amount of irrigation
    water to apply. The reward function (R) is the profit made at the end of the season
    after the expenses associated with irrigating are covered and the goal of the
    agent is to perform a set of actions that maximizes this profit. 3. Literature
    review The literature review focused on collecting a wide selection of refereed
    journals from major publishers. A total of 56 publications were initially found.
    Among them, 16 studies were selected as they were more relevant to the application
    of ML algorithms in irrigation prediction and decision-making. These 16 studies
    are discussed as follows. Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) were the first scholars
    to use Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Systems
    (ANFIS) to predict the weekly irrigation run time of three drip irrigated citrus
    plantations in Spain. The goal was to find the irrigation duration that maximizes
    the yield while optimally managing water. Using volumetric water content, soil
    water potential and crop evapotranspiration as input data, the predicted irrigation
    run time by the two models were evaluated against irrigation reports provided
    by an agronomist. Both models accurately predicted the irrigation pattern followed
    by the agronomist but ANFIS outperformed PLSR by giving a better estimation of
    weekly irrigation amount. Sun et al. (2017) developed a RL algorithm to perform
    irrigation planning and scheduling. A neural network was used to emulate DSSAT
    in predicting seasonal total soil water content using irrigation and weather information
    as input. A second neural network was then used to predict crop yield using the
    predicted total soil water content. The crop yield prediction was then used as
    the training data to train the RL model. Soil moisture and yield were predicted
    to train the model and find the optimal irrigation schedule that maximizes the
    net return (see Equation 1). The net return was then taken into consideration
    in the model to measure economic gain and adapt to future changes in the produce
    and water price. The model was tested by simulating maize planted fields in Temple,
    Texas, (USA), Kunnunurra (Australia), Hyderabad, (India), and for wheat yield
    prediction in Saskatchewan (Canada). The predicted total soil water results were
    used by an irrigation controller to apply an adaptive amount of water as needed.
    This technique enabled automatic irrigation and surpassed threshold and fixed-based
    irrigation in the tested locations by achieving a higher net return. The developed
    irrigation system addresses the dynamic and complex nature of irrigation scheduling
    and control by taking into consideration the current and future soil water content
    variations to adaptively optimize irrigation schedules which is a significant
    contribution to improved water efficiency in irrigation systems. Its limitation,
    however, is that it is restricted to a small total soil water space and is not
    suitable for large-scale problems (continuous soil water space). Furthermore,
    the proposed system has not been tested with actual field conditions, therefore
    its performance cannot be validated in real applications. Net return = yield (kg/ha)
    * price of product (dollars/kg) – water use (ha-mm/ha) * price of water (dollars/mm)
    Equation 1. Kumar et al. (2017) created a fully automated intelligent irrigation
    system based on IoT to gather temperature, soil moisture, and raindrop sensor
    data. The data collected is used by a microcontroller for analysis of the irrigation
    needs of several crops including beans, curry leaves, lady fingers, moringa, and
    radish. A motor is activated for irrigating the field when moisture values drop
    below a threshold range. Using recorded temperature and water flow data, a linear
    regressor is used to predict the next irrigation water requirement. The system
    then schedules irrigation based on the irrigation amount predicted by activating/deactivating
    a relay which in turn activates or deactivates a solenoid valve as needed. The
    linear regression model is updated in case there is a change in the data. The
    system also includes a mobile app that enables users to have access to field data
    remotely. The performance of the system was, however, not compared to other irrigation
    demand assessment approaches, nor did the authors specify how much water can be
    saved. This work contributed to advancing the automation of irrigation systems
    to enable remote monitoring and control. Its innovative incorporation of IoT technology
    with ML for water demand assessment and scheduling was a stepping stone for achieving
    better results in water use optimization with limited labor. Goap et al. (2018)
    developed a smart irrigation system based on IoT and ML techniques. A combination
    of sensor-collected field data such as soil moisture, soil temperature, Ultraviolet
    (UV) light radiation, and weather forecast data including precipitation, air temperature,
    and other variables, was used to compute future soil moisture based on which irrigation
    requirements were determined. The smart irrigation architecture consists of an
    IoT data collection system that collects, transmits, and processes sensor data
    and weather forecasts. A soil moisture prediction algorithm was developed as a
    combination of SVR and k-means clustering algorithms that calculate soil moisture
    change due to weather conditions. An irrigation scheduling algorithm then takes
    the predicted daily soil moisture, retrieves precipitation information to find
    the nearest day it is expected to rain, and computes the required soil moisture
    to maintain crop growth. If the required soil moisture is below the minimum threshold
    a command is sent to a relay switch to start the water motor and vice versa. A
    responsive web portal is used to view the projected soil moisture along with expected
    rainfall and to start or stop irrigation. The algorithm achieved a correlation
    coefficient and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.56 and 0.135 respectively, when
    estimated soil moisture deficit (SMD) was compared to sensor-based SMD. The limitation
    of this work is that no water-saving analysis was performed to assess its potential
    against other systems. Additionally, the experiment was performed in a garden,
    so there is no record of its performance on a larger area such as a farm system.
    On the other hand, the study exemplifies how fully autonomous smart irrigation
    systems can be developed using sensor-collected data and weather forecasts to
    run ML algorithms and predict water demand. Concurrently, Goldstein et al. (2018)
    used regression and classification algorithms to build an ML model based on sensor
    and weather data to predict irrigation quantities for jojoba-planted fields in
    Israel as prescribed by an agronomist. These data were subdivided into eight subsets
    of different features to determine the accuracy of the models when inputs were
    changed. LR, Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT), and Boosted Tree Classifier
    (BTC) were used to estimate irrigation water demands. The models were evaluated
    on their ability to provide an irrigation value that is not more than 0.2 mm above
    or below the agronomist’s one. It was observed that LR performed unsatisfactorily
    giving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equal to 0.466 and a performance accuracy
    of 52.3%. GBRT outperformed LR as the lowest RMSE was 0.11 and the accuracy rate
    reached 92.7%. The BTC algorithm also performed well with an accuracy of 95%.
    It was concluded that non-parametric models perform well compared to LR methods
    in cases where there is a non-linear functional relationship between the dependent
    and independent variables. The authors also observed that the model run with less
    input data (such as the model run without saturation/drought data) provided quite
    similar results to the model in which all the variables were used to train the
    model highlighting the fact that selecting appropriate features is more important
    in achieving satisfactory performance. In another study, Adeyemi et al. (2018)
    developed a predictive irrigation scheduling system using the Feed Forward Neural
    Network (FFNN) model and LSTM. A neural network (NN) model was used to predict
    the one-day-ahead volumetric soil moisture using historical soil moisture and
    climatic data. Based on the predicted soil moisture, crop water requirement, and
    soil water retention, the irrigation depth and timing were determined for a potato
    field. According to the obtained results, the two models performed comparably
    on the validation datasets and provided better predictions than those of a non-ML
    approach that estimates the soil moisture from the average of previously observed
    three-day soil moisture values. However, the LSTM model outperformed the FFNN
    model in terms of regression coefficient when datasets from different sites were
    used. This showed the robustness of LSTM networks in approximating the underlying
    functional relationship between inputs and outputs for situations similar to the
    learned ones. The LSTM model was coupled with AQUACROP to simulate potato crop
    growth and develop a predictive irrigation scheduling system whose goal was to
    maintain the soil moisture within a set of upper and lower boundaries during the
    simulation period. Given the predicted soil moisture, the deficit amount of water
    to reach the upper bound was computed and the irrigation amount was defined as
    the water depth needed to replenish the soil to attain the set threshold. The
    system was compared with a rule-based irrigation system, the former achieved a
    water saving of more than 20% in the three tested sites compared to the latter
    while maintaining the same water use efficiency. Using daily climatic data and
    daily irrigation amount collected in a period of one year, Perea et al., 2019
    developed a model to predict irrigation amount based on farmers’ decisions about
    when to irrigate. The crops grown in the area were drip-irrigated tomato and maize
    and rice, which was flood-irrigated. The purpose of the model was to simulate
    the occurrence of irrigation one day ahead as planned by farmers. This model was
    developed using DT and optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal
    DT that accurately simulates farmers’ behavior. Based on the defined objective
    functions, three Classification Trees (CT; CT1, CT2, and CT3) were selected. The
    first CT (CT1) outperformed other DTs by accurately predicting all the observed
    irrigation and no irrigation events, achieving a performance accuracy of 100%
    in both cases. CT2 followed with an accurate classification of 73% of the irrigation
    rates and 93% of no irrigation rates. Lastly, CT3 was able to classify 68% of
    the actual irrigation rates and 93% of no irrigation rates. The developed model
    contributes to irrigation management by providing information on when to schedule
    irrigation and hence could help in better coordinating irrigation activities to
    minimize energy and water loss. Weekly irrigation amounts of orchards of citrus
    trees (orange, mandarina and lemon trees) located in Southeast Spain were predicted
    using a modelling system driven by LR, a random forest regressor (RFR), and SVR
    algorithms (Torres-Sanchez et al., 2020). These algorithms were trained to perform
    the irrigation assessment, as such the goal was to imitate the irrigation recommendations
    of an agronomist. Using the daily average matric potential of the previous five
    days, the total water needs, whether the fruit is gaining weight or not expressed
    as a binary value as input the ML models were trained to output the total irrigation
    amount recommended by the agronomists for the following week. The results were
    compared with irrigation prescriptions by agronomists. Results showed that RFR
    performs better than SVR and LR with an RMSE of 16.83m3, 17.13m3, and 19.5m3,
    respectively. A weekly average error of 9% was obtained when the predicted irrigation
    amount was compared with the agronomist’s report. To overcome the drawbacks of
    traditional RL models such as Q - Network (QN), Yang et al. (2020) proposed a
    deep Q - Network (DQN) to control irrigation scheduling. The difference between
    QN and DQN is that the former generates the value function table while learning
    from the data whereas the latter uses ANNs to compute the value function from
    multi-dimensional input data. Hence ANNs offer the possibility to handle a large
    amount of data and precisely render the irrigation scheduling problem more scalable.
    The environment was interfaced by AQUACROP, and simulations were conducted using
    three crops namely maize, wheat, and soybean. The state of the environment was
    described by the date, crop stage, precipitation, reference ET, total water content
    in the effective root zone, stomatal water content, and irrigation. Actions consisted
    of irrigation amounts from 0 mm to 10 mm with a 0.5 mm increment. Results demonstrated
    that the suggested algorithm outperformed traditional irrigation approaches such
    as constant irrigation, and percentage available water in dry, moderate, and wet
    weather conditions and was closest to the Q learning estimation for dry conditions.
    Coupling AQUACROP with DQN for irrigation scheduling allowed for a more comprehensive
    assessment of crop water demand by enabling the simulation of different crop growth
    scenarios based on the applied irrigation amount. This integration also addresses
    the data scarcity issue often encountered in ML modeling. The system was however
    not directly tested on the farm, the replication of results as far as implementation
    is concerned is thus not ascertained. To determine the right set of features to
    use for determining the irrigation scheduling of a drip-irrigated rice field from
    weather parameters based on ML, Sidhu et al. (2020) used correlation to identify
    the dependencies in the data and guide the selection of feature sets. Features
    with a correlation of 0.7 and above were discarded. The variables found useful
    and used as input features for irrigation scheduling were number of days after
    sowing, maximum temperature, dry bulb at 6:00 AM, humidity at 2:00 PM, soil temperature
    20 cm below surface at 2:00 PM, sunshine hours, wind speed, wind direction, ET,
    number of days since last rain and number of days since last irrigation. Among
    different algorithms used in their study, Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) and Adaboost
    outperformed other algorithms. As noted by Goldstein et al. (2018), LR was unable
    to perform well in predicting irrigation demand. It was also demonstrated that
    Adaboost could perform equally well with a limited number of selected input features.
    Zhou (2020) proposed an RL method that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    to estimate the value function used to train the DQN algorithm. The algorithm
    uses sensor-collected soil data such as moisture and humidity, air temperature
    and air humidity, leaf water potential, and leaf conductance collected from a
    grape-growing greenhouse plantation as input features to train the model. The
    system improved irrigation decision-making on the plantation with no human intervention.
    To overcome the limited learning capability of some previously developed ML models,
    Kashyap et al. (2021) created a Deep Learning Intelligent Irrigation System for
    precision Agriculture (DLiSA) based on NN and IoT-enabled approaches that account
    for climate and soil moisture variations. The system comprises the one-day-ahead
    soil water content predicted by an LSTM model, an irrigation scheduler to compute
    the volume of irrigation water, and an irrigation planner to calculate the duration
    of the irrigation period and the water delivery across the field. Irrigation commands
    are then passed to the actuator nodes from which they get to the water valves.
    The particularity of this system is that it integrates feedback from climate and
    soil sensors which enables it to adapt to local changes and perform well during
    historical periods. A comparison of this irrigation system with those obtained
    with a threshold-based irrigation model and an FFNN showed that 43% and 23% of
    water volume, respectively are saved using DLiSA. Jimenez et al. (2021) used LSTM
    with soil matric potential (SMP) collected at three soil depths (i.e., 150, 300,
    and 600 mm), rainfall, and irrigation amounts as input data to predict irrigation
    schedules during a corn-growing season for sandy clay loam and loamy fine sand
    soils for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in advance. In addition, three different LSTM
    models were developed by changing inputs to evaluate the predictability of LSTM
    networks concerning the input data. The input data used for the first model were
    SMP at 150-, 300-, and 600-mm soil depths, management zone, rain, and previously
    applied irrigation; the second model used SMP and management zone, whereas the
    third model only used SMP as input. The results indicated that the same error
    and predictability level obtained for the first model can also be obtained using
    only SMP data. In terms of temporal models’ performance, the 1-hour ahead irrigation
    predictions were accurately predicted the same as the three and six hours-ahead,
    but the accuracy gradually decreased for irrigation predictions of 12- and 24-hours
    advance causing overfitting or underfitting. Nevertheless, it was concluded that
    irrigation prescriptions changes can be accurately forecasted on time by LSTM.
    The authors also noted that using rainfall and irrigation data as input caused
    overfitting in the testing period. This is because rainfall patterns change over
    time and those rainfall amount fluctuations might be unknown for the model. Y.
    Chen et al., 2021 combined several classifiers to form a strong irrigation predicting
    approach using stacking and boosting ensemble learning methods. The model was
    developed to predict irrigation volumes for multiple fields in a greenhouse of
    organic vegetables. Air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature, soil humidity,
    and light intensity data were used as input variables to linear SVR, Support Vector
    Classification (SVC), RF, and DT. Model performances of 0.45, 0.675, 0.645, and
    0.54 were obtained for each model, respectively. Stacked generalization was employed
    to combine the advantages of these algorithms using extreme gradient boosting
    (XGBoost) which improved the performance from 0.58 to 0.64. The best performance
    was obtained when simulated and observed water volumes were compared with 3.33
    and 8.16 for the MAE and RMSE, respectively. Concurrently, Deep Q learning was
    implemented by M. Chen et al., 2021 to perform irrigation scheduling for paddy
    rice using short-term weather forecasts. The input features defining the field
    environment on a daily basis consisted of one week forecasted rain sequence, water
    depth as well as minimum and maximum thresholds of water depth and the maximum
    allowable water depth where the maximum allowable water depth and the maximum
    threshold are determined based on the growth stage. The three irrigation actions
    that are defined to irrigate were no irrigation, supplying 50% or 100% of the
    water needed to attain the maximum water depth. Results showed that no yield losses
    were experienced in the studied period. The DQN was able to consider current field
    water conditions and weather forecasts to efficiently choose to irrigate or delay
    irrigation in order to avoid under or over irrigation which resulted in water
    conservation and increased rainfall use. Comparing irrigation with the flooded
    irrigation strategy, the DQN method reduced water use by 23 mm. This research
    demonstrates how advanced computational techniques based on ML can enhance irrigation
    prediction. By applying weather forecasts in crop water demand assessment to limit
    unnecessary irrigation, more water is conserved compared to conventional irrigation
    methods. The study also underscores the ability of the applied algorithm to optimize
    water despite imperfect weather forecasts thanks to its ability to learn from
    past irrigation experiences and weather forecast uncertainties. More recently,
    Alibabaei et al. (2022) trained a DQN to schedule and optimize irrigation for
    a tomato field. The state of the environment was expressed by a combination of
    average temperature, average relative humidity, precipitation, reference evapotranspiration,
    average wind speed, total soil water in profile, and irrigation amount. Actions
    consisted of irrigation amounts ranging from 0 to 60 mm - ha/ha. The agent environment
    was simulated by two LSTM models. One was to predict the one-day soil moisture
    in advance and the other was used to approximate the seasonal harvest based on
    the growing season environmental conditions and then determine the net return.
    To estimate the Q-table, an ANN, an LSTM, and a CNN were used. LSTM surpassed
    other algorithms because it memorized previous input data and used the retained
    information in the subsequent time steps. The results achieved by the developed
    algorithm showed an increase in the productivity in the test field and a reduction
    of irrigation water in comparison to threshold-based and fixed irrigation by 18%
    to 30%. The crucial finding of this study that showcases the strength of ML models
    is the ability of the developed irrigation system to adapt irrigation scheduling
    to the crop growth stages. At the beginning of the season, the system avoids water
    losses by adopting a lower water supply scheduling which gradually increases as
    the season progresses and eventually reduces to stress the plants towards the
    harvest period. This ensures that enough water is available to sustain the plants
    during the critical growth period and minimizes water losses at the start and
    end of the season. The surveyed studies illustrate the ability of ML algorithms
    to make use of data from different sources including weather forecasts, to assess
    crop water demand and predict irrigation schedules in a more efficient way that
    optimizes water use compared to conventional approaches. The attained water efficiency
    is shown by the amount of water saved as opposed to traditional fixed period or
    threshold value irrigation techniques that do not account for spatial-temporal
    changes in soil, crop, and meteorological variables. With the real-time data acquisition
    approaches enabled by IoT and the progress made in coupling IoT with ML models
    as applied and demonstrated in the several presented studies, ML algorithms hold
    great potential for automating the irrigation decision-making process. This will
    improve further timely irrigation scheduling and eradicate the additional work
    of manually controlling irrigation systems. Applying ML models in irrigation decision-making
    and scheduling is also economically beneficial as the crop water waste, the cost
    of water, and labor demand are minimized. Table 1 summarizes the reviewed studies,
    the algorithm used, and the obtained model performance. Table 1. ML based irrigation

    in irrigation water use modeling 4.1. Data scarcity The performance of ML models
    highly depends on the availability of sufficient data to accurately learn the
    underlying relationship between the predictors and the variable to be predicted.
    Due to the high variability of soil and climatic conditions in space and time,
    data should be available at a fine spatial-temporal resolution for proper results
    to be obtained. Data availability is often a challenge as the collected data by
    sensors such as soil moisture, are point measurements and hence do not represent
    the entire field’s conditions. To obtain representative information about the
    field’s conditions and improve the performance of ML models, many sensors need
    to be installed across the field which can be expensive. In addition, satellite-derived
    data can be useful for irrigation prediction but often are not available at the
    field scale. Satellite data can be an alternative source of data, however, the
    frequency at which data is collected is usually low due to orbital paths. The
    collection of good-quality satellite data is also hindered by the effect of canopy
    or cloudy atmospheric conditions which leads to significant data gaps. Moreover,
    the spatial resolution of these data is sometimes not satisfactory. For instance,
    the presently operating soil moisture products are available at a coarse resolution
    that cannot be directly used in irrigation prediction at the field level if not
    downscaled (Zhang et al., 2021). On the other hand, downscaling data adds more
    uncertainties that can compromise the modeling results. The data scarcity problem
    can be addressed by integrating remote sensing and field sensors’ collected data
    to increase the reliability of simulated results. In the event of low sensor coverage,
    satellite-based measurements can help bridge the spatial-temporal data gap. Satellite
    data such as soil moisture, surface temperature, Leaf Area Index (LAI), etc. can
    be used to supplement sensor data in modeling field conditions after carefully
    downscaling the data to the field level. Satellite-based measurements can also
    be used to validate sensor-measured data by detecting outliers. Having a complete,
    reliable dataset would considerably improve the performance of ML models and allow
    farmers and Extension irrigation specialists to make more informed irrigation
    decisions. Furthermore, most models use soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling
    methods; thus, soil moisture is commonly used as an indicator of crop water stress.
    However, plant water stress-related indices can also be useful predictors to assess
    irrigation demand (Jones, 2004, Gu et al., 2020) but no significant work has been
    done to build ML models for irrigation predictions using these variables. Thus,
    data of either plant-water status, such as measurements of leaf/stem/xylem water
    potential and leaf thickness, or plant physiology, such as sap flow measurements
    by sensors, stomatal conductance, and plant thermal sensing, can potentially enhance
    data availability and irrigation prediction accuracy. In addition, data augmentation
    techniques have been proven to remediate the data scarcity problem. Specifically,
    image data can boost the performance of ML models in irrigation modeling and applications.
    Data augmentation techniques are mostly applied in crop-weed classification (Fawakherji
    et al., 2020, Su et al., 2021, Divyanth et al., 2022, Espejo-Garcia et al., 2023)
    and plant disease diagnosis (Wu et al., 2020, Cap et al., 2022, Huang et al.,
    2022) Data augmentation involves implementing a sequence of methodologies to generate
    new images from the existing image dataset. Data augmentation techniques fall
    into three categories; the first class involves basic augmentation techniques
    that increase the size of a dataset by changing the geometric position of points
    in an image hence generating a new data point examples of this technique are geometric
    transformations such as scaling, rotating, and skewing images. Noise injection
    techniques such as Gaussian or uniform noise are also common techniques to increase
    data samples. They entail adding noise to data to increase the variance. The deformable
    augmentation technique is the second category of data augmentation techniques
    that can be used when the basic techniques do not provide satisfactory variability
    and include methods such as spline interpolation, which uses a piecewise polynomial
    function to interpolate a new data point between two observed points. Using statistical
    shape models is another advanced method to generate new data by using observed
    data and a mathematical model to understand the dataset’s variability and implement
    changes within the limit of possible parameters. The third category of data augmentation
    techniques is generative DL techniques. These approaches increase the volume of
    data by learning features in a dataset to generate synthetic but realistic datasets.
    The most common DL networks are generative adversarial networks (GAN) and their
    variants. Adversarial learning refers to the contest between two NNs, a generator
    and a discriminator. The generator learns to generate new data such that the distribution
    of the generated data is as close as possible to that of the observed data. The
    discriminator, on the other hand, learns to evaluate the generated data and differentiate
    them from authentic data. In addition to increasing the sample size, these techniques
    reduce overfitting by introducing new patterns in the data that can make a model
    more generalizable. 4.2. Noisy and heterogeneous data Data is the foundation of
    every ML project. Hence, preprocessing data prior to their use is an important
    step to ensure data quality and reduce the possibility of defective data that
    hinder model efficiency. Data noise and heterogeneity are the common issues encountered
    during data collection and preprocessing. Raw data contains numerous flaws such
    as missing values, incorrect values, and incorrectly formatted values that introduce
    noise to ML. Directly feeding such data to ML models is inappropriate as they
    may fail to derive the right pattern. Poor data quality can thus lead to significantly
    unsatisfactory performance. Data should be machine-readable, trustworthy, and
    impartial. By ensuring data is correctly classified, data curation can assist
    ML model developers in validating the diversity of training data for irrigation
    modeling applications. Therefore, it is important to statistically analyze and
    understand the data and select suitable methods for removing noise and bias in
    the data. To counteract the substantial bias that data preprocessing methods may
    induce in predictions, it is recommended that maximum entropy constraint be applied
    on the inference step (Pfeiffer et al., 2015), forcing predictions to have a distribution
    similar to the one of observed values. Although data sparseness might persist
    and perhaps be exacerbated by big data, the volume of big data presents exceptional
    prospects for predictive analytics because sufficient frequency may have been
    achieved for diverse sub-samples. On-farm big data are in divergent formats, from
    distinct population samples, and so are very heterogeneous. It can be very tedious
    to transform heterogeneous data into a uniform format. In addition, these heterogeneous
    data may be of different levels of importance in the learning process (Zhou et
    al., 2017). Therefore, adding all the features and giving them equal weights in
    ML models is unlikely to lead to optimal learning results. 4.3. Lack of accessibility
    and reproducibility of data and machine learning models Irrigation data is part
    of large earth system datasets that are produced at the farm scale; however, the
    majority of this data is not openly shared and is unavailable. Other irrigation
    metadata are put into password-protected and key-value data structures that limit
    their findability and accessibility significantly. Open access to data should
    be improved to better serve irrigation scheduling applications (Gu et al., 2020).
    Open data advances research by preventing duplicate data collection efforts freeing
    up resources to gather a more distinct collection of data and a more comprehensive
    record of observations. Secondly, open data regulations promote increased data
    usage and reuse. For example, after enacting the Landsat open and free data policy,
    data downloads increased by 20 times from 2009 to 2017, and, according to the
    annual number of publications, data use increased by four times (Z. Zhu et al.,
    2019). Advancing research is not solely limited to making data readily available
    but also requires the availability of developed software. Providing open access
    to software’s source code allows computational and scientific transparency and
    reproducibility. Scientific reproducibility is evasive if free access to code
    is restricted. Gil et al. (2016) argued that simply providing textual explanations
    of algorithms and code implementation may hamper reproducibility. Moreover, open-source
    software favors software reuse which reduces duplication possibilities, promotes
    the use of open data, and guarantees the code’s lifespan (Committee on Best Practices
    for a Future Open Code Policy for NASA Space Science, 2018). A rising recognition
    of the necessity of making data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and
    reusable (FAIR; Wilkinson et al., 2016) has set a standard for expanding the availability
    of research standards and tools that ease data sharing and management (Wagner
    et al., 2022). FAIR principles imply that data and tools must be easily findable,
    freely obtainable, and reusable so that methodology and derived results can be
    entirely transparent (Koymans et al., 2020). Data and tools can be findable when
    they are sufficiently described by rich metadata and registered or indexed in
    a known and accessible searchable resource. Accessibility means that users and
    machines, following appropriate authorization and via a well-defined protocol,
    can obtain data and the related tools. For data and tools to be interoperable,
    they should be described using normative and community-known specifications. Reproducibility
    is another aspect of the FAIR principle that received less attention in the irrigation
    community. Reproducibility necessitates describing in detail the characteristics
    of the data and tools, and their origin according to community standards with
    clear and accessible conditions for usage (Boeckhout et al., 2018). At a minimum,
    ML modeling outcomes should be reproduced and ideally replicated by other users
    before it is deployed. Currently, farm-related data, including irrigation, soil
    moisture, and climate information, are not based on the FAIR principles, nor their
    metadata format and terminology are constrained by these guidelines. To move towards
    a FAIRer future that boosts the availability of farm-related data and tools, continuous
    generation of FAIR metadata standards and reproducible tools are indeed needed
    for future data-driven applications in irrigation modeling. Towards this end,
    scientific communities can adopt several best practices, namely making their data
    and ML algorithms accessible in a public cyberinfrastructure and in a non-proprietary
    standardized format, creating a digital object identifier for their data and tools,
    and providing clear licensing information along with constraints on the use. To
    encourage reusability, software and code should also be openly available through
    a non-restrictive license adopted by the community to facilitate reproducibility.
    4.4. Blackboxness of machine learning models The explainability and interpretability
    of ML models are another aspect of ML that has been questioned in the past (Kaur
    et al., 2020, Moraffah et al., 2020). Enhancing models’ predictability comes at
    the cost of increasing their complexity which often makes them less interpretable.
    However, the interpretability of ML models is more important than their accuracy
    (Rudin, 2019). For example, to trust the irrigation recommendations provided by
    a model, irrigation specialists and crop consultants would be more interested
    in knowing the accuracy of irrigation recommendations for a certain scheduling
    time than in the structure of the algorithms and the types of performance metrics
    used in the model. Explainable ML has initiated a set of methods to increase the
    interpretability and explainability of ML models (Carvalho et al., 2019, Miller,
    2019). In the agricultural domain, these techniques have been applied in several
    prediction tasks such as crop yield estimation (Sihi et al., 2022, Wolanin et
    al., 2020), prediction of daily pan evaporation and evapotranspiration (El Bilali
    et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023) and in monitoring fields’ conditions for optimizing
    crop production (Sabrina et al., 2022). To interpret the results of a model, the
    current ML approaches aim to evaluate the effects of various combinations of input
    variables on the results by applying techniques such as Shapely Additive exPlanations
    (SHAP) that can assess the pros and cons of an input feature on the model output.
    Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is another popular technique
    applied to make ML models’ results human interpretable by estimating the behaviour
    of a complex model, it consists of adding noise to a data point without changing
    the rest of the dataset, fitting the new dataset to the model, and observing the
    behaviour of the model (Ribeiro et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, these
    approaches have not yet been adopted in explaining irrigation predicting models;
    there is, therefore, room to improve the understanding of these models by incorporating
    such techniques into the current ML modelling structures. 4.5. Lack of human interaction
    with machine learing-based irrigation modeling Although considerable effort has
    been made to develop irrigation decision-making models, current models lack a
    way to integrate expert knowledge into the simulation process. The limited success
    of these models is partly because the decision rules used in the models are limited
    in scope than the factors growers use to make decisions (Car, 2018). Researchers
    mostly create models that can tackle agricultural problems without the need for
    human interaction. Unfortunately, a majority of existing models have not yet reached
    this degree of intelligence. Due to calculation time constraints and the complexity
    of agricultural problems, models may provide imprecise irrigation recommendations.
    As a result, agricultural knowledge from experienced irrigation specialists, Extension
    professionals, and experienced farmers can be employed in the model to improve
    the feasibility of ML outcomes and validate the results. An interactive interface
    that allows professionals to share their knowledge and perspectives can be an
    approach to considering expert judgment. Another way to allow human control over
    ML models is to develop systems that enable human-in-the-loop feedback and interactions.
    The effective application of ML models in irrigation scheduling systems requires
    that humans control their outcomes to minimize the risk of lethal results. Efficient
    human control is the capability to incorporate human knowledge into the modeling
    process to make informed, timely decisions that provide the greatest operational
    outcomes possible (Boardman and Butcher, 2019). ML systems must create models
    that take into consideration a range of contextual data in order to function well
    in complicated settings (National Academies of Sciences, 2021). This allows the
    systems to make decisions by accurately understanding the current situation and
    projecting future scenarios. However, human-in-the-loop techniques need to be
    developed to ease the collaboration between ML models and irrigation experts such
    as Extension irrigation specialists and experienced farmers. This will help align
    goals and synchronize task prioritization, resource allocations, and improved
    irrigation decisions. 4.6. Uncertainty and error in machine learning simulation
    Although ML techniques for irrigation decision-making were proven to be helpful
    in irrigation planning, all the reviewed papers did not take into consideration
    the errors and uncertainties in the predictions. Uncertainty in irrigation modeling
    stems from the continuously changing environment, such as meteorological conditions
    and soil moisture variations. The lack of uncertainty quantification in the ML
    predictions may result in overfitting or underfitting outcomes. Considering ML
    predictions without assessing the extent to which results are credible given the
    associated uncertainties in the input data and model often leads to inappropriate
    or biased decisions. For example, if the input data fed to a model trained to
    predict the irrigation amount lies outside the training data distribution, the
    model may generate unreasonable irrigation recommendations that are essentially
    based on an “educated guess”. But, if the prediction is accompanied by confidence
    intervals that is the certainty the model itself has of its prediction, the decision
    taker would be informed of this randomness and decide on the irrigation amount
    accordingly. Thus, an assessment of uncertainties in the simulated results is
    crucial to ensure that the results fall within a certain level of confidence.
    Generally, uncertainty can arise from input data and the ML procedures or structure
    in the modeling process. There are two types of uncertainties, (i) epistemic uncertainty
    resulting from the ML architecture choice and model parameters and (ii) aleatory
    uncertainty due to a physical system’s intrinsic randomness. Aleatoric uncertainty
    describes the inherent randomness of the data-generating process, which cannot
    be justified by gathering additional data samples or observations (Kendall and
    Gal, 2017). This form of uncertainty is caused by unknown processes that pertain
    to the concept of randomness, i.e., the unpredictability in modeling outcomes.
    Aleatoric uncertainty can further be subdivided into homoscedastic and heteroscedastic
    uncertainties. Homoscedastic uncertainty is independent of ML inputs, which means
    that it remains consistent regardless of input. Because this sort of uncertainty
    produces uniform variances for all inputs, the variation in observation noise
    for all input parameters is constant (Tabas and Samadi, 2022). On the other hand,
    heteroscedastic uncertainty varies with datasets, where some inputs provide more
    noisy outputs than others. Aleatoric uncertainty does not increase for out-of-distribution
    data contrary to epistemic uncertainty that can be handled in the modeling process
    if sufficient training data is available. Epistemic uncertainty may increase during
    the testing period for those data points that lie outside the training dataset.
    Thus, the larger the training dataset the lower the epistemic uncertainty. Modeling
    these two types of uncertainties increases the predictive performance of models.
    Understanding how individual sources of uncertainty propagate to the integrated
    irrigation system response is useful in analyzing the impact of data and model
    uncertainty on the simulated results. Additionally, distinguishing these uncertainties
    helps understand the sources of errors that have the potential to be reduced.
    Differentiating them also makes decision-making transparent and helps in making
    more informed (irrigation) decisions as unreduced uncertainties are clear and
    known (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen, 2009). Uncertainty estimation methods can
    be classified into four categories namely single deterministic methods, Bayesian
    approximations, ensemble learning, and test-time data augmentation methods. The
    most widely used methods are Bayesian approximations such as Monte Carlo dropout,
    Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) optimization methods (Duane et al., 1987), Bayesian
    Model Averaging (Samadi et al., 2020), and ensemble learning methods such as deep
    ensemble, Bayesian deep ensemble, and Dirichlet deep networks (Abdar et al., 2021).
    Largely, data uncertainty for a normally distributed uncertainty can be measured
    by predicting the parameters of a probability distribution for instance the mean
    and standard deviation (Kendall and Gal, 2017, Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017).
    These approaches can be coupled with ML-based irrigation water use modeling to
    reduce errors and uncertainty during both training and testing periods. However,
    to efficiently reduce uncertainty in ML modeling, rigorous tests of the suitability
    of different irrigation process parameterizations and model parameters are needed
    across different model development stages as well as various testbeds and farm
    settings. 5. Physics-guided machine learning (PGML) PGML offers a compelling solution
    to improve irrigation decisions and the interpretability of ML models. The interactions
    between plants, the soil, and the environment are complex and require a wide range
    of physical processes to be accurately programmed and described in space and time
    by a data-driven model. PGML provides an opportunity to leverage the best attributes
    of both data and physical processes in the ML models (Shen et al., 2018). Combining
    physical processes with data-driven capabilities can be performed in a variety
    of ways. Approaches to incorporate physical principles into ML models involve
    constructing new ML architectures that can employ some physical laws and processes
    in the irrigation water use prediction. These improvements are possible because
    ML models are modular and versatile. Scientific knowledge can be utilized to define
    node links that capture physics-based correlations among variables. Another method
    for infusing established physical properties into an ML architecture is to assign
    physical significance to some neurons in the network by incorporating physical
    intermediate variables into the network (see Fig. 6). Daw et al. (2020), for example,
    implemented these two approaches in LSTM for lake temperature modeling by introducing
    physics-informed connections among neurons in the network. Furthermore, they added
    physical significance to some of the network’s neurons by calculating physical
    intermediate elements along the network’s route hence creating a unique physics-guided
    LSTM structure. Another related method is to set some of the neurons’ weights
    to physically meaningful values or parameters and make them constant throughout
    the ML training process. Download : Download high-res image (103KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 6. Physics guided architecture of ML (adapted from
    Daw et al., 2020). Another point of view, however, tackles the challenge of embedding
    prior knowledge in an ML from a different perspective. Currently, rather than
    creating a specific model structure that indirectly imposes prior knowledge, endeavors
    are being made to enforce physics-constrained learning by encoding appropriate
    partial differential equations (PDE) into the loss function of ML approximations
    utilizing methods such as automated differentiation, (see for example Sirignano
    and Spiliopoulos, 2018; Raissi et al., 2019; Y. Zhu et al., 2019; Geneva and Zabaras,
    2020). This approach comprises a double learning process, where an algorithm learns
    to concurrently match the observed data and to produce outputs that approximately
    meet a specific set of physical laws such as energy and mass conservation. Constraining
    the optimization of data-driven models is a natural way to include domain knowledge
    in the process of learning, and by doing so physically implausible predictions
    can be avoided. For problems where linear equations can be used to describe physics-based
    constraints, integrating the latter in existing constrained optimization formulations
    is straightforward. However, many agricultural problems involve complex non-linear,
    and dynamic processes. For instance, simulating crop yield as a function of numerous
    inputs such as irrigation timing and amount, plant cultivar, and soil hydraulic
    properties have constraints that are expressed in complex formulations such as
    non-linear relationships between variables or PDE which are not effectively treated
    by conventional constrained optimization approaches. In this case, it is crucial
    to form constrained optimization methods that can use common PDE forms and can
    handle the non-linearity of physical variables. 6. Discussion This paper reviewed
    16 studies that were relevant to the application of ML in supporting irrigation
    decision-making. The goal was to identify ML algorithms commonly used to build
    systems supporting irrigation decision making, analyze developed systems based
    on these algorithms and discuss their performance and limitations as ways to improve
    irrigation water use management. We observed that the input data for soil and
    weather-related parameters used to train the developed models were obtained mainly
    from sensors distributed across the study areas. Therefore, wireless sensor networks
    and IoT technologies have played an important role in enabling the application
    of ML models in irrigation water use modeling. However, careful selection of input
    features is crucial to obtain a good model performance. While it is important
    to critically select the input data, it was demonstrated by Goldstein et al. (2018)
    and Jimenez et al. (2021), that having many input variables to predict irrigation
    demand does not imply having a better model. More than half of the reviewed papers
    used simple ML algorithms such as LR, RF, SVM, DT, etc. which sometimes do not
    accurately simulate the relationship between the plant and its environment, especially
    for high-dimensional datasets. As stated by Goldstein et al. (2018), Torres-Sanchez
    et al. (2020), and Sidhu et al. (2020), due to the non-linear relationships among
    soil, weather variables, and crop water requirement, linear regression models
    do not perform well because they cannot accurately learn the underlying functions
    and data patterns that relate the input to output process. Therefore, in crop
    water requirement prediction, the algorithms that can simulate the non-linearity
    between the inputs and outputs are recommended. Ensemble learning methods such
    as Adaboost and GBRT provide a way to improve the predictability of ML models
    and have demonstrated good performance in predicting irrigation management over
    algorithms such as LR. According to the results of Alibabaei et al. (2022), LSTM
    networks perform better than other algorithms because they can make use of the
    retained information from previous time steps in the following ones to provide
    better predictions. Hence, they have proven to be robust and able to accurately
    simulate the relationship between the dependent and independent variables when
    data sets from new sites are used. We postulate that PGML can be a better approach
    to modeling the interlinkage between the soil, plant, and climate variables. Moreover,
    these interactions vary extensively in time, distance, and region and physical
    attributes can better describe these variabilities; thereby incorporating physics
    into the ML algorithms can justify these interlinked processes and parameter choices
    for which reliable values can be obtained. On one hand, it was observed that ML
    approaches have shown the potential to support irrigation decision-making and
    reduce the time spent by agronomists on analyzing a large quantity of data to
    determine irrigation water requirements. On the other hand, ML models require
    a wide range of data in space and time which are often not readily available.
    To overcome this challenge, additional data sources were discussed and data augmentation
    methods such as GAN are proposed as approaches to generate new data. However,
    both data and model uncertainty should be addressed in data-driven crop water
    demand modeling. We observed that there is a lack of both aleatoric and epistemic
    uncertainties assessments in all the surveyed studies, yet these uncertainties
    affect considerably the simulation results and, subsequently. the reliability
    of the developed systems. Additionally, there is still a lack of incorporating
    agronomists’ knowledge in the irrigation decision-making process. To bridge this
    gap, human-in-the-loop approaches to enable interactions between farmers and ML
    models should be explored in the future. Lastly, to widen the adoption of the
    ML-based irrigation decision-making systems, we recommend the implementation of
    FAIR principles in irrigation modeling as has been the case for other disciplines
    such as ecological and environmental modeling (Petzold et al., 2019, Quay et al.,
    2021) and water science simulations (Crystal-Ornelas et al., 2022, Cannon et al.,
    2022). For ML-based irrigation decision-making models to have an impact on water
    sustainability and management, data and the resulting tools must be openly accessible,
    easily findable, and reusable. 7. Conclusions This review highlights the outcomes
    of ML based irrigation scheduling models applied in different geographical, farm
    and crop settings. We discussed the current state-of-the-art models and proposed
    several approaches that could complement data-driven irrigation modelling. To
    summarize, the reviewed studies provided promising outcomes for irrigation scheduling.
    As we make progress in data-driven simulation, we expect to gain a new understanding
    of the relative importance of the choice of different neural network architecture
    and their workflow and structure that drive decisions and actions. The review
    analyses presented herein are intended to provide a basis for data-driven irrigation
    scheduling applications across different environmental and geographical settings.
    Further research is, however, needed to ensure the effectiveness of developed
    ML models and their applicability in farms with different soil, weather, and crop
    characteristics. Recognizing a growing enthusiasm for data-driven modeling applications
    in irrigation scheduling, we anticipate growth on several facades: (i) a better
    ML model capable of forecasting irrigation water use in advance, (ii) a better
    benchmarking irrigation model to compare with the data-driven approaches, and
    (iii) a better pre-processing approach for data and error estimation methods and
    the ways to leverage human-in-the-loop in the ML modeling system. As always, we
    welcome discussions with irrigation research communities interested in data-driven
    and other related ML modeling development to address irrigation hydrology challenges.

    are highlighted. Introduction Recent advancement in the Internet and Web technologies
    has made availability of the pitch to users to create and use information as web
    services effectively. Web services incorporate much genuine data gathered by smart
    forms and provide the same to users. This stirring thought coined the term Internet
    of Green Things (IoGT). The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol1–6
    was invented by Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper in 1999. The properties such
    as bandwidth efficient, light weight, data agnostic, simple implementation, and
    session awareness are much helpful to implement this framework. JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON) is basically a syntax for serializing the objects such as strings,
    numbers, arrays, and so on and used for swapping data that are outlined to be
    perceived clearly by humans and parsed logically and effortlessly by machines.
    As JSON itself is entirely language independent, it is sought-after often for
    dispatching data through the RESTful Web Services.7–9 Since a public Web API is
    accessible, it provides a programmatic access to the developers. API is usually
    outlined as a collection of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for requested messages;
    it also receives alongside the response message structure in the context of Web
    development. This article scrutinizes the MQTT’s publish/subscribe services on
    low-cost smart robots, optimization of Representational State Transfer Application
    Programming Interface (REST API) and JSON data from sensors, and a simple Raspberry
    Pi–based cloud for green house. Furthermore, how far it is utilized to process
    the data from the Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is analyzed. A
    standard data pattern should be determined while creating an application to communicate
    with private and warehouse systems. There are ranges of public and standardized
    options available and the supreme choice and the ultimate selection depends on
    the vital demands and functionality of their applications. The data in an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) payload are encapsulated to some extent of a Simple Object
    Access Protocol (SOAP)-based Web services.9–11 In many application frameworks,
    when XML performs professionally, it has some downsides that make it less than
    ideal for others. As a result, the creation of interactive web applications creates
    petulant user experience by its innumerable access. Ultimately, using JavaScript,
    these asynchronous calls originate on the end user and integrate formatting information,
    transfer it to a web server, parsing and processing with the actual response information.12–19
    JSON procures a standardized data exchange format, which is more appropriate for
    web applications, while many browsers are able to build, transfer, and parse XML.
    On the other side, JSON is an autonomous human-readable format with a broad range
    of implementation possibilities. Information will be intentionally formatted as
    per the JSON standard.20 It is now predominantly a format of data and is not limited
    to web applications virtually used in any framework where applications require
    the exchange or storage of structured information as text. Innumerable libraries
    for almost all programming languages grant simple parsing of JSON data, and most
    of the web frameworks currently reinforce generating JSON as response data.14,16
    In addition to the fact that JSON has a small-scale foot-print than XML, it is
    appropriate for situations where network speed is restricted. Evidently, mobile
    devices habitually have slower connections and hence welfare from a compact download.
    API is a group of procedures, conventions, and mechanisms for creating software
    applications.21–28 An API states how software elements communicate and are being
    exploited while programming the Graphical User Interface (GUI) components. In
    divergence to a private API, a public API is available widespread for all developers
    to fetch the green house data in gain access. They permit the developers to access
    data which can then be utilized to augment their own applications. Public APIs
    can remarkably enlarge income in the absence of the business to put money in recruiting
    brand new programmers who produce for them a very commercial software application.
    Nevertheless, it is essential to recall that opening the data from database to
    the public may result in a wide range of reliability and management challenges.
    For example, issuing public APIs can create rigidity for institutions to command
    experienced clients with their information benefits. Public API publishers cannot
    conclude that the client apps created on their APIs would provide a better user
    experience. The primary focus and usage of the MQTT protocol here are publishing
    and subscribing JSON-based data topics to open IoGT use cases.2,4,29–40 Low-cost
    android application (app) contained a smart home system prepared to remotely turn
    on/off a group of 208 devices using only four digital pins of an Arduino UNO board–based
    ATmega328microcontroller.41 The appliance-switching scheme requires approximately
    70% lower cable costs for real-life fitting in home correlation to the standard
    devices linked. The smart home system includes repeated alerts by light if it
    detects humans very near at night and the “exterior mode” will shut it down for
    each single machine connected to the system with a touch from the Android app
    when the user leaves. A smart security system is able to make an alarm, send a
    message, and call the user by Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) module
    to probe several intrusions in the house. Home energy management system (HEMS)
    is a decentralized structural design based on a multi-agent system.42 This intellectual
    energy management system is to be developed by IEEE- and FIPA-accommodating multi-agent
    platform. This enables agents to communicate, interact, as well as negotiate by
    energy sources plus devices of the smart home to give energy usage to reduce the
    cost of electricity bill. Multi-agent systems are used for implementing HEMSs
    to illustrate the communication of agents among devices for energy sources in
    sequence.43–50 Presently, no interacting low-cost and highly autonomous robots
    are found in the green houses. In particular, sensors are placed and data manipulation
    has been done manually or with the help of web interfaces. Besides, some tasks
    such as information gathering about current status and health of a plant have
    long been considered to be too complex to automate completely. In addition, green
    houses face the problem of labor shortages. As a consequence, the production process
    is progressively affected. In this context, we surveyed the above-said approaches
    and applications focused on improving the operational conditions, liveliness,
    effectiveness, protection, efficiency, and profitability of agricultural processes,
    in cases where physical labor will not be able to replaced by but can be complemented
    with proposed low-cost robots. In this article, we propose a set of Flask-MQTT-based
    autonomous wheel robots working under the control of Raspberry Pi on which the
    broker is installed. These low-cost ESP8266 robots are interacting with each other
    about data gathering and updating with one another. The accumulated data from
    the robots are stored in the database. The integration of robotics with IoGT gains
    more advantage in acquiring spatial information data connected with irrigation.
    Visualization techniques and perspectives based on IoGT for precision agriculture
    in the field of farming are highlighted. Table 1 describes the functionality metrics
    of MQTT over HTTP. From the observation of the table given, the key contribution
    of this proposed work can be viewed as the smart autonomous wireless robots controlling
    the green house from anywhere providing the green house’s data of flask server
    at the Raspberry Pi. The MQTT-based publishing/subscribing system for interoperability
    among smart robots and REST API has also been developed in Flask. In REST API,
    how the JSON data are manipulated with the MQTT protocol is described in the following
    section. Table 1. Functional comparison between MQTT and HTTP. Functionality MQTT
    HTTP Data transmission Pub/sub GET/POST Performance Light weightand simple Complex
    Methodology Data-centric Document-centric Upper layer Runs over TCP Over UDP Data
    distribution One to many One to one Content size Small Large TCP: transmission
    control protocol; UDP: user datagram protocol; MQTT: message queuing telemetry
    transport; HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol. The organization of this work starts
    with various related works. From the observations, the significance of API and
    background technologies such as JSON and MQTT is explored. Then, implementation
    of IoGT—A Flask-based python framework—and REST API for accessing low-cost ESP8266
    wheeled robots through MQTT publish–subscribe technique is discussed. The results
    from device interactions, round trip time (RTT), and performance are analyzed
    consequently. Proposed system MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol used frequently
    in the message interactions of Internet of Things. JSON is a self-describing and
    hierarchal structure. The syntax of JSON is predefined by two basic structures
    as name-value pairs described as ordered set of values.9 The value in the said
    structures can be any of the types listed such as number, array, object, string
    (unicode), Boolean (true or false), and null. These structures can be nested;
    nested arrays are the mostly used values in the JSON data interchange format.
    The JSON values cannot be a function. Since this flexible structure is used in
    RESTful Web services, we bring this on MQTT as topics while publishing or subscribing.
    Example of green things in JSON Listing 01 { “Title”: “Temperature”, “Description”:
    “DS18B20”, “Type”: “ONEWIRE”, “Properties”: { “Values”: { “ID”: “ESP-1”, “temp”:
    34.3445 } } } The values and keys are description of temperature sensor and respective
    values enclosed in double quotes. Double quotes are not necessary if the value
    is a number. If the JSON value is a number, it can be expressed as an integer
    or floating point. The file extension of the JSON data format is JSON. Both the
    JSON and the XML shall be exploited to measure the local and flexible objects
    in human-readable and text-based, data proxy format. Besides, these data exchange
    formats are more identical with the given text in any preferable format, and the
    same another one is grasped in the other format.9 Therefore, when determining
    an information exchange format, choosing one to the other is not a simple occurrence;
    instead, preferably, the format has the characteristics making it the appropriate
    choice for a particular implementation. JSON has preferably roots in programming
    languages and hence it yields a more accepted and readily accessible mapping to
    exchange the structured data whereas XML has its own style preferably for mapping.
    Formally, both JSON and XML both support internationalization since they are supporting
    Unicode. Finally, this convenient data format is more practical on the transactions
    between the smart house and the data center. Analysis of web API GUI provides
    simpler access for users to utilize programs and APIs create it easier for programmers
    to use precise technologies in creating applications. By extracting hidden implementations
    and disclosing objects or actions that only the developers require, an API minimizes
    the cognitive work on them. While a graphical interface for an email user might
    supply a user along with a button which exhibits all the procedures for extracting
    and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output will provide the programmer
    a function that duplicates a file from one location to another. Web APIs provide
    access for programmers to exploit remote data by underlying protocols and certain
    standards for interaction which allows various technologies to perform together,
    despite of platform or language. Consider an example of Java Database Connectivity
    API that permits developers to query various kinds of databases with the similar
    group of operations. Java Remote Procedure Call (RPC) API utilizes the protocol
    to permit invocation functions to operate remotely (Figure 1). Consequently, remote
    APIs are convenient in preserving the object encapsulation in object-oriented
    programming. Web APIs are the predefined interfaces across which communications
    occur between an enterprise and applications that utilize its benefits. An API
    perspective is an architectural outline which spins everywhere, assigning programmable
    interfaces to a group of services to a variety of applications serving widespread
    types of consumers. Figure 1. Accessing data center via APIs. The proposal of
    an API has outstanding influence on its performance. The concept of data encapsulation
    explains the task of programming interfaces by folding the implementation information
    of the modules by which the users of modules do not perceive the difficulties
    inside the modules. Hence, the design of an API tries to issue only the mechanisms
    a user would expect. The design of programming interfaces constitutes a significant
    part of software component. Public Web APIs are available for most of the data
    requirements for the developers and the programmers. APIs may include data of
    various areas like books, business, cloud storage and file sharing, health, music,
    news, science, sports/fitness, transportation, university, and so on.9 The OpenWeatherMap
    is a public Web API which provides weather data for variety of mobile and web
    applications. This API provides free access to its subscribed customers. To access
    this API, users shall create an account and API key is provided for the subscribed
    user for accessing the Web API. Data for Weather Web API are collected from the
    weather stations in different format including current weather information, historical
    weather data, days, and an hour forecast information and daily forecast information.
    The current weather information format gives weather data for different geographical
    locations all over the world. This API is often updated from the weather stations
    established in different locations. The data are available in XML, HTML, and JSON
    formats. The user shall request the data in any format according to their need.
    The next format for retrieving weather data is historical weather data. This format
    provides historical data of the weather in hours for any location from 1 month
    and may be up to 5 years according to the user’s subscription. The days and hour
    forecast information contribute weather data for about 5 days. For these 5 days,
    the weather data for every 3 h are provided. The next format for this API is the
    daily forecast information. This format yields weather data for about 16 days.
    The weather data for any requested unique location or city can be retrieved by
    the name of the city, ID, coordinates, and by postal code. The city name and the
    country code of the city can be added to the request message. Then, the corresponding
    weather data for the given city can be obtained. The API provides a list of cities
    with corresponding IDs in their website. The weather data can be accessed using
    the city ID. The weather data can also be accessed by the use of geographic coordinates
    like latitude and longitude and by the city’s zip code. Along with this, the API
    provides the weather data for multiple cities. The weather forecasting for the
    cities within a zone (specified by the latitude and longitude) and the cities
    within a circle defined by center point can be obtained. The responds of the API
    contain only the originally measured and calculated data. The responds comprise
    many parameters like coordinates (latitude and longitude), temperature, humidity,
    pressure in sea level and ground level, wind speed and direction, and rain and
    snow volume. If any parameter is not found in the respond, it implies that the
    particular phenomenon has not happened in the weather stations at the time of
    measurement. The value of the parameters is retrieved in the specific format defined
    in the API documentation. The formats have different units. For example, the value
    of the temperature shall be retrieved in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and in Kelvin units.
    The values can be retrieved in the users’ required formats. The values shall be
    retrieved in integer and float. The response of the API call shall be obtained
    in multiple languages supported by the Web API. The Web API supports numerous
    languages so as to draw attention from the users all over the world.9,11 The API
    produces the data in the user requested formats. Similar to the OpenWeather Map
    API, we bring our own API developed by Flask framework to control and maintain
    the smart home data. Sample API call and respond API request in JSON Listing 02:
    API respond in JSON {“coord”: {“lon”:-3.74,“lat”:5.2}, “weather”:[{“id”:801,“main”:“Clouds”,“description”:“few
    clouds”,“icon”:“02d”}],} … “id”:2288873, “name”:“France”, “cod”:200} Listing 03:
    API request in XML <city id=“2288873” name=“France”> <coord lon=“-3.74” lat=“5.2”/>
    <country>CI</country> <sun rise=“2019-07-01T06:06:03” set=“2019-07-01T18:31:08”/>
    </city> … <weather number=“801” value=“few clouds” icon=“02d”/> <lastupdate value=“2019-07-01T18:27:44”/>
    </current> As JSON is simple to handle, it has become the typical format. The
    optimization of JSON files plays an important role while parsing the same. There
    are some requirements for the optimal performance and features of JSON files.
    Multiple JSON files are needed for better performance. Many of the JSON parsing
    libraries can read them from a stream when compared with reading from the string.
    As this is more efficient, preference shall be given for stream reading wherever
    it is possible.9,21 For achieving better optimization, the JSON files can be compressed
    up to 90%. The JSON files can be compressed in Zip format while communicating
    to the corresponding web services. Parsing of JSON can be avoided if it is not
    needed. In case the web app receives the JSON and stores it to a database or any
    other storage, it is not necessary to parse them. The process of serialization
    should be given more importance for better JSON optimization. It is not necessary
    to serialize all data fields. Instead, the null values can be omitted. The use
    of shorter field names makes it more human-readable and gives 5–10 percentage
    boost in performance and parsing. It also allows smaller data packets to transfer
    along the web. The API requests will be handled by HTTP/GET and raw data in response
    can be serialized by means of any comfortable serialization methods available
    in some elegant scripting languages such as iOS swift, Python, Hypertext preprocessor
    (PHP), and so on. Obviously, the optimization may be sensed in between 3 and 5 Mbps
    by subtle variations with different service caching among XML (SOAP), REST XML,
    and REST JSON. Table 2 demonstrates the HTTP topics of Web API. Table 2. HTTP
    topics of web API. HTTP method Action Topic GET Acquire information about a resource

    HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol; API: application programming interface. Implementation
    of Flask API for ESP8266-MQTT wireless robot Flask is a lightweight python web
    framework to construct a flexible API. In order to build the API framework, there
    are two extensions in Flask that help build RESTful services. The clients of web
    service are low-cost NodeMCU robots that command requesting the service to add,
    remove, and modify tasks. This is what is needed to device a method to store independent
    tasks. An appropriate method is to build a flexible database. The HTTP topics
    are normally generated by accessing the smart robots as depicted in Table 2. Flask
    Framework for green house is depicted in Figure 2 in which publish–subscribe is
    event-driven and readily pushes messages to smart robots. This involves an additional
    and essential communication point usually known as the MQTT broker,6 where the
    Raspberry Pi is in charge of transmitting all messages between senders and rightful
    robot clients. Raspberry Pi is responsible for monitoring the publishers as well
    as subscribers in the same way for the sake of knowledge about how many publishers
    are live. Every client robot that publishes a message to the Raspberry Pi includes
    a JSON URI as a topic into the message. The topic is normally the routing information
    for the Pi, and hence the robot that wants to receive messages, subscribes to
    a firm topic about holding the smart house data. The Pi brings all messages with
    the corresponding JSON URI or topic to the client who may or may not have to be
    familiar with each other. They insist to communicate the topic only. This construction
    facilitates highly scalable solutions without numerable dependencies between data
    producers and consumers. Figure 2. MQTT—Flask framework for green house. Web application
    is firmly developed using HTML, Flask (Python) web server platform, and JQuery
    (Figure 3). A call back function in the MQTT protocol is used here to send and
    receive data to green house. Web interface is made for controlling the smart robot
    and to monitor ONEWIRE (DS18B20) sensors data and each location of the green house.
    One of the benefits for the use of these sensors is that it allows digital input
    to make a network of sensors with a single outlet (GPIO). Figure 3. Flask-controlled
    web page for accessing smart robots. Validation In the assessment, temperature
    data are gathered from DS18B20 (mounted on ESP8266 robots) through Raspberry Pi
    via APIs of publish–subscribe within every second. The following steps have been
    discussed to acquire benefits of above-said Flask API server-based interface for
    a smart robot: 1. A web interface is implemented with a JSON endpoint. A separate
    JSON host is constructed in Flask to develop a responsive interface. 2. A web
    repository with Flask API with database is roughly used to build an interface
    for control application for implementation without hard-coding the technology
    of a device. 3. The experimental results have shown that it is better to adapt
    a lesser response time consumes MQTT than HTTP. 4. For the sake of convenience,
    the transmitted message is used as an effortless JSON object that can hold a single
    key-value pair along the publishes on smart robots. 5. The key alternate options
    for JSON are the standard methods of HTTP, usually GET or POST.6 However, they
    are not preserved due to the problems raised in content caching while gathering
    the sensor readings. It is evident that when selecting MQTT over HTTP, the RTT
    as depicted in Figure 4 is mostly lesser than a standard HTTP. It is important
    to reclaim similar connection to some extent. The efficiency of communication
    against a smart robot gains is significant compared with the HTTP standards since
    MQTT is data agnostic and light weight. The ultimate guarantee of efficiency in
    MQTT protocol gives importance to density for each payload message. This technique
    ensures additional defiant ways to attain composition against gathered data from
    sensors. The connection status and delivery of messages to the smart robots are
    depicted in Figure 5. The response time per connection cycle is examined in Table
    3. The critical approach is employed to decrease the payload size where enormous
    data could be transmitted by sensors eventually. Figure 4. Round trips between
    devices and server. Figure 5. Connection status and messages delivery to robots.

    payload size for different numbers of percentages. The simulation result proves
    that the proposed method has used less amount of payload size. Figure 7 illustrates
    the performance comparison in spite of average computation cost for the normal
    class and also the modified class for the proposed method MQTT. Figure 6. Payload
    size comparison. Figure 7. Performance comparison. Conclusion This article proposed
    an MQTT-based Flask API framework in the IoGT to monitor and control greenhouse
    system with Raspberry Pi cloud. The proposed architecture presents the frequent
    publish–subscribe messages among the low-cost ESP8266-attached smart robots. An
    access interface was developed as a Flask web page for users to access green house
    from anywhere. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format when compared with
    the traditional XML. The response messages conspicuously retrieved in the JSON
    format are cached in effective when the public APIs are requested by the programmers
    rather than using response in XML. This work determined the higher parsing efficiency
    of the JSON for accessing backend data through available public Flask Web API.
    An interface was developed in Python Flask to gather information from smart farm’s
    ambient data to manage people with various sensors connected in low-cost robots.
    The main contributions of this research are as follow: 1. IoGT: A Flask-based
    python framework and REST API was developed for accessing low-cost ESP8266 wheeled
    robots. 2. Data gathered from the robots through MQTT publish–subscribe technique
    and successfully transferred (also stored for future references) to REST API.
    3. The data integrated by robots with IoGT gains more advantage in gathering about
    spatial information data connected with the irrigation. 4. Visualization techniques
    and perspectives based on IoGT helped for precision agriculture in the field of
    farming are highlighted. 5. Adapting a lower response time consumes MQTT than
    HTTP from the experimental results. 6. Implemented framework insisted that the
    incredibly lightweight JSON object hold data between the publishers and subscribers
    (ESP8266 robots). Further studies will create an adapted and responsive web application
    with the help of MQTT and machine learning methods51–61 to allow users to interact
    by topics against smart wireless robots with minimal efforts. Declaration of conflicting

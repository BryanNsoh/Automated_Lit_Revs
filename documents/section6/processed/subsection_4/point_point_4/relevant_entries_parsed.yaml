- explanation: '**Explanation:**


    The provided text is a comprehensive literature review on the use of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) in circular business models (CBMs). The authors first define IoT
    as a network of connected devices that can collect, transmit, and act on data,
    and then discuss the four main IoT capabilities that are relevant to CBMs: monitoring,
    tracking, optimization, and design evolution.


    The authors then map these IoT capabilities to the six Rs of the CBM framework,
    which are: reduce, reuse, recycle, repair, refurbish, and redesign. They find
    that IoT can enable a variety of circular economy practices, such as tracking
    the location of products, optimizing resource use, and designing products for
    easy disassembly and repair.


    The authors also discuss the environmental benefits of using IoT in CBMs, and
    find that IoT can help to reduce energy consumption, waste generation, and pollution.
    However, they also note that there are some environmental drawbacks to using IoT,
    such as the energy required to produce and operate IoT devices, and the potential
    for e-waste.


    Overall, the authors conclude that IoT has the potential to make a significant
    contribution to the circular economy, but that there are also some challenges
    that need to be overcome. They call for further research on the environmental
    impacts of IoT, and on the development of new IoT technologies that can support
    circular economy practices.

    1. Wastewater data

    2. Survey data

  explanation: 'The key points are:


    1. Conventional wastewater treatment methods and disinfection are expected to
    eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 but their high population and under-maintained wastewater
    treatment plants can contaminate the surroundings where the SAR-CoV-2 survive
    up to several days on untreated water and much longer in a lower temperature region.

    2. Wastewater surveillance or wastewater-based epidemiology is turning to be a
    great potential tool for assessing and managing COVID-19. Current studies of the
    wastewater-based epidemiology or wastewater surveillance provide population-scale
    information for the detection of the hotspot, measure the scope of the outbreak,
    provide stakeholders with a decision platform, understand the impact of the demand
    in the health sector, track infection and measures, and provide an early warning
    for re-emergence of the pandemic outbreak.

    3. Mathematical modelling of the COVID19 SARS‑COV‑2 load into the wastewater treatment
    plant estimated that the SARS-CoV-2 load into the wastewater treatment plant was
    in the range of 100 to 400 g faecal per day per person.'
  extract_1: Wastewater treatment plants are designed to reduce inactive pathogens
    such as viruses, protozoa, and bacteria that are harmful to human beings. Inadequate
    and inefficient wastewater treatment plants pose a health hazard to the receiving
    waters, irrigation system (agriculture), recreation centres and source of the
    drinking water. Most viruses in the water system are non-enveloped and consist
    only of the nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) engulfed in a capsid protein. An enveloped
    virus has an outer membrane with lipids and protein, relatively fragile and no
    longer infective when destroyed. Envelop viruses are much sensitive to heat, acids,
    pH, disinfectants and detergents, and thus not able to withstand the stomach acidity
    medium for a long period. Enveloped viruses are assumed inactive and absent in
    the wastewater system. Enveloped viruses are responsible for many high-profile
    pandemic outbreaks like Swine Flu, Spanish Flu, SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory
    syndrome (MERS-CoV), Ebola and currently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Virus exposure
    to the UV radiation in form of sunlight or optimum UV wavelength range of the
    disinfection of 100–290 nm followed by chlorination before discharge to the receiving
    environment assist with denaturing and elimination of the COVID-19 in the water
    system. Inadequate treatment is widely presented in the ageing infrastructure
    of wastewater treatment plants in developing countries. This raises concern about
    the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the water systems.
  extract_2: 'The SARS-CoV-2 load into the wastewater treatment plant was estimated
    by (Zhang et al. 2020) using excretion rates in human stool by the assumption
    that the faecal load in the range of 100 to 400 g faecal per day per person and
    with the faecal specific density of the 1.06 g/ml. The estimation of the COVID-19
    in wastewater can be calculated using Eq. 1 (Hart and Halden 2020a):


    where N(t) is the quantity remaining of the sample that did not decay after a
    time, No is the initial excreted sample discharge into the collecting wastewater
    treatment system, t is the time elapsed between excretion and sampling, t ½ is
    the half-life of the biomarker (Wilkinson, 2020).'

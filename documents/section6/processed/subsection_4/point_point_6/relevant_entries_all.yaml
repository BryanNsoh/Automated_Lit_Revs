    \ new demand for system architectures,\ninfrastructure and platform deployment\
    \ approaches, in order to fulﬁll the requirements of a new breed\nof highly distributed\
    \ smart applications. The number of devices connected to the Internet has been\n\
    increasing steadily [1,2], so smart applications will typically have to deal with\
    \ thousands or even\nmillions of devices. Customized conﬁgurations, automated\
    \ reconﬁgurability, and scalability are critical\nchallenges in any successful\
    \ deployment of IoT smart applications [3], in areas such as agriculture [4,5],\n\
    cities [6,7], healthcare [8] and industry [9].\nLayered architectures are critical\
    \ structures in computer networks and distributed systems as\nthey facilitate\
    \ the understanding of roles, locations, and levels of abstraction of diﬀerent\
    \ networking,\nhardware, and software components. Diﬀerent IoT architectures have\
    \ been proposed for facilitating\nSensors 2020, 20, 84; doi:10.3390/s20010084\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n2 of 24\nthe understanding\
    \ and design of smart applications, with three [10], four [11,12], or ﬁve layers\
    \ [12–14].\nThe 3-layer architecture—application, network, and perception layers—was\
    \ soon replaced by a 5-layer\narchitecture by adding two new layers—middleware\
    \ and business—considered thus more adequate\nfor the rapid evolution of IoT systems.\
    \ Also, intermediate 4-layer architectures have been proposed,\nadding, for example,\
    \ a security and management layer. The reason behind the growing interest in IoT\n\
    architecture is that a complete solution for IoT smart applications requires diﬀerent\
    \ software, hardware,\nand communication technologies working together and integrating\
    \ a variety of platforms, components,\nservices, and applications. IoT smart applications\
    \ require careful consideration and new concepts to be\ndeveloped as they are\
    \ inherently distributed, spanning from sensors and actuators in the ﬁeld up to\
    \ a\ncloud datacenter and further to a user smartphone, passing by intermediary\
    \ stages at diﬀerent levels\nof fog computing infrastructure.\nIoT architectures\
    \ provide a functional view of software, hardware, and communication components\n\
    placed into layers for facilitating system design and development. However, they\
    \ do not provide\nindications on where these components should be deployed. As\
    \ the end-to-end data ﬂow occurring in\na smart application includes sensors deployed\
    \ in the ﬁeld whose data usually are processed in the\ncloud, the deployment of\
    \ architectural components is a complex task that may vary according to the\n\
    characteristics, requirements, and constraints of applications and stakeholders.\
    \ In such a complex\nenvironment, a one-size-ﬁts-all approach does not adapt well\
    \ to varying demands and may hinder the\nadoption of IoT smart applications. On\
    \ the other hand, a clean and layered architecture deﬁnition\nmight open the way\
    \ towards engineering processes that enable ﬂexible reallocation of data and services\n\
    to the diﬀerent deployment stages, for increased performance and scalability [15].\n\
    In this paper, we introduce a new IoT architecture for smart applications called\
    \ IoTecture,\ncomprising ﬁve layers, namely L1-Device, L2-Transport, L3-Data,\
    \ L4-Model, and L5-Service.\nOur experience with deploying an IoT platform derived\
    \ from the implementation of this architecture in\nfour pilots with diﬀerent characteristics\
    \ in three countries [4] taught us that there is no one-size-ﬁts-all\napproach\
    \ for this process. The need for our IoTecture is due to the acknowledgment that\
    \ the traditional\n5-layer architecture is not prone to having an active role\
    \ in the deployment of new applications since\nthe business, application, and\
    \ middleware layers are too generic with broader scopes.\nTherefore, together\
    \ with IoTecture, we developed the concept of an IoT computing continuum,\ncalled\
    \ IoTinuum, to provide a clear view of the diﬀerent deployment locations for architectural\n\
    components, divided up into ﬁve stages, namely S1-Thing, S2-Mist, S3-Fog, S4-Cloud,\
    \ and S5-Terminal.\nBy representing architecture layers and deployment stages\
    \ separately and mapping one into the other,\nwe obtain a ﬂexible mechanism for\
    \ reasoning on functionality and placement, thus allowing the\ndeployment of IoT\
    \ smart applications on diﬀerent scenarios. We advocate that IoTecture is not\
    \ just yet\nanother passive IoT architecture since it is actively used for the\
    \ deployment of software components\ninto distributed locations of IoTinuum.\n\
    Diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations of layered IoTecture components mapped into\
    \ staged\nIoTinuum places generate diﬀerent hardware and software bottlenecks\
    \ represented by the use of\nsystem resources. In order to facilitate the understanding\
    \ of the tradeoﬀs involved in this mapping,\nwe conducted a performance analysis\
    \ study with six conﬁgurations of a FIWARE-based IoT platform,\nvarying the smart\
    \ application (agriculture and city), the low power wide area network (LPWAN)\n\
    technology [16] such as LoRaWAN [17], the workload and the use of fog computing\
    \ infrastructure\n(no fog, lightweight fog or heavyweight fog). Our results show\
    \ that diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations\nof layered components into staged locations\
    \ generate diﬀerent hardware and software bottlenecks\nrepresented by the use\
    \ of system resources. The physical location where a software component is\nexecuted\
    \ has a signiﬁcant impact on the performance and scalability and brings diﬀerent\
    \ tradeoﬀs,\nas revealed by our performance analysis results. The concepts and\
    \ processes involved in architecting\nand deploying smart applications, together\
    \ with the practical performance analysis results, increase\nthe understanding\
    \ and awareness involved in the development and operation of a new breed of\n\
    IoT-enabled systems.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n3 of 24\nThe contributions of this\
    \ paper are threefold. Firstly, the proposal of IoTecture and IoT continuum\n\
    and the mapping of one into the other for facilitating the deployment of IoT smart\
    \ applications.\nSecondly, the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of diﬀerent\
    \ technologies according to the\nIoTinuum approach, analyzing tradeoﬀs, and highlighting\
    \ the suitability of each scenario. Thirdly, we\nincreased the understanding of\
    \ how diﬀerent components of FIWARE and LoRaWAN behave under\nheavy workload,\
    \ as our experiments indicate that some FIWARE components deal poorly with high\n\
    throughput applications. This problem has not been identiﬁed before in the literature\
    \ because most\nstudies with available results do not stress the system enough\
    \ to detect system bottlenecks.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section 2 introduces\
    \ the background and related work, and\nSection 3 presents IoTecture and IoTinuum.\
    \ Section 4 details the research design and methods of our\nperformance analysis\
    \ study, whose results are presented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6.\
    \ Finally,\nSection 7 draws some conclusions and presents future work.\n2. Background\
    \ and Related Work\n2.1. IoT Architectures and Platforms\nLayered architectures\
    \ are critical structures in computer networks and distributed systems as\nthey\
    \ facilitate the understanding of roles, locations, and levels of abstraction\
    \ of diﬀerent networking,\nhardware, and software components. In order to separate\
    \ concerns, it is pertinent to emphasize that\nfrom an IoT architecture, diﬀerent\
    \ application software architectures can be derived as they deﬁne the\nhigh-level\
    \ structure of a system comprising software components and relations [18]. However,\
    \ here\nwe do not elaborate on application software architectures.\nThe initial\
    \ proposal of a generic IoT architecture had three layers, namely application,\
    \ network,\nand perception [10]. The application layer processes large amounts\
    \ of data using computational\nintelligence techniques and interfaces with users.\
    \ The network (also called transport) layer deals with\ncommunication and networking\
    \ technologies to transfer data from sensors to the place of processing\nand send\
    \ commands back to actuators. The perception (also called sensing) layer collects\
    \ the data from\nsensors. However, soon, a 5-layer architecture was proposed to\
    \ deal with the rapid development of\nIoT solutions at the time, adding two more\
    \ layers: middleware and business [12–14]. The middleware\n(also called processing\
    \ or service) layer deals with data and databases, as well as service functions,\
    \ such\nas discovery, composition, and management. The business layer is a loosely\
    \ deﬁned one that aggregates\ngeneral functions to deal with an entire IoT system,\
    \ including business models and security/privacy.\nDiﬀerent extensions of the\
    \ 3-layer IoT architecture added only one new layer, a middleware/service\nlayer\
    \ [6,19], and a security and management layer [20]. As for the latter, here we\
    \ consider that\northogonal layers more adequately address these non-functional\
    \ requirements.\nNowadays, most eﬀort in developing and deploying new IoT smart\
    \ applications is aimed at\nimproving distributed data management in order to\
    \ make data promptly available for the processing\nof application-speciﬁc models,\
    \ both physical and data-driven ones. Also, these proposals follow a\ncommon approach\
    \ in the past where layered IoT architectures provided an initial functional view\
    \ of\nthe entire solution, and after some iterations in the development process,\
    \ they gave way to software\narchitectures and artifacts.\nIt is imperative the\
    \ need to implement and deploy highly distributed IoT applications that span\n\
    from the things, going through diﬀerent processing/storage/transmission stages,\
    \ up to the cloud, and\nfurther to the user terminal. In other words, we advocate\
    \ that IoT architectures must have an active\nrole in the deployment of new applications.\
    \ An option is to embed deployment locations within\nthe architecture, explicitly\
    \ recognizing the existence of edge processing [21]. However, we consider\nthat\
    \ a new concept is needed to separate the concerns of layered software components\
    \ from staged\ndeployment locations. In the 5-layer IoT architecture, the business,\
    \ application, and middleware layers\nare too generic with broader scopes, which\
    \ do not facilitate the activity of system deployment.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n\
    4 of 24\nAn IoT platform—also known as IoT software platform [22] or IoT middleware\
    \ [19,23]—\nimplements an IoT architecture providing a variety of building blocks\
    \ to facilitate the development of\nan IoT smart application, such as device connectivity,\
    \ device management, data management, data\nanalytics, security, and visualization.\
    \ An IoT platform gathers data from IoT devices and enables\nthe development and\
    \ of smart applications that control, monitor, and manage these devices. It is\n\
    often composed of several middleware components, each of then focusing on a speciﬁc\
    \ feature in a\nparticular layer to provide an end-to-end platform involving data\
    \ generation, transmission, storage,\nand processing.\nPractitioners can rely\
    \ on diﬀerent IoT platforms available, both open-source and commercial\nsolutions\
    \ [11,19,24]. These platforms may use multiple protocols and standards or even\
    \ proprietary\nsolutions.\nThis plethora of platforms leads to interoperability\
    \ problems since developers must\nadapt their applications to each platform, using\
    \ speciﬁc API, information models, and protocols [25].\nThus, standard interfaces\
    \ are needed to fulﬁll this interoperability issue among IoT applications and\n\
    heterogeneous IoT platforms. Also, security requirements must be addressed, such\
    \ as authentication,\nauthorization and access control, and secure communication\
    \ [26,27].\nFIWARE [28] is an open-source IoT platform that has been attracting\
    \ widespread attention in the\nlast years, comprised of a series of generic enablers\
    \ (GEs) that provide diﬀerent services. A combination\nof GEs builds diﬀerent\
    \ applications that exchange data through a REST API based on OMA NGSI [29].\n\
    Entities and their attributes represent the key aspect of the FIWARE NGSI context\
    \ management\ninformation model.\nOrion is the main FIWARE GE, a publish/subscribe\
    \ context broker and an eﬃcient data distributor,\nproviding an interface where\
    \ producers publish entities that are further notiﬁed to consumers. Orion\nonly\
    \ stores the last entity version published so that it must work together with\
    \ other GEs to keep\nhistorical data. The IoT Agent GE translates sensor data\
    \ in diﬀerent formats to NGSI and publishes\nit in Orion. There are diﬀerent implementations\
    \ of the IoT Agent, where each one maps diﬀerent\nIoT communication protocols\
    \ and data models to NGSI. The standard FIWARE IoT Agent receives\nMQTT data from\
    \ the sensors formatted in the Ultralight 2.0 protocol [30]—a lightweight text-based\n\
    protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications where the bandwidth and\
    \ device memory\nmay be limited resources. Currently, the oﬃcial FIWARE IoT Agent\
    \ implementation that supports\nLoRaWAN communication is unstable. Therefore,\
    \ we developed our own version of IoT Agent capable\nof mapping LoRaWAN messages\
    \ in the NGSI format.\n2.2. LPWAN Technologies for IoT\nIn recent years, LPWAN\
    \ technologies have been developed to meet the needs of IoT. LPWAN\nprovides long\
    \ transmission ranges, low energy consumption and low bandwidth [16], which make\
    \ it\nan attractive technology for IoT applications that send a few dozens of\
    \ bytes every couple of minutes\nor hours, such as street lighting, pollution\
    \ monitoring and irrigation for agriculture–i.e., smart cities\nand smart agriculture\
    \ scenarios. LPWANs follow a star topology, where sensors send data directly\n\
    to a data hub called gateway, which has a stable energy source and Internet connection.\
    \ Three\nLPWAN technologies are leading the forefront of this ﬁeld: Narrowband\
    \ IoT (NB-IoT) [31], Sigfox [32]\nand LoRaWAN [33]. NB-IoT, developed by 3GPP,\
    \ uses a subset of the LTE standard that limits the\nbandwidth to 200kH, thus\
    \ using cellular base stations for communication with devices. Sigfox uses\nunlicensed\
    \ ISM bands to connect end-devices to base stations based on patented technologies.\n\
    LoRa operates in the sub-GHz ranges, such as 433 MHz and 868 MHz (Europe) and\
    \ 915 MHz\n(USA and Brazil) [17]. The physical layer is called Long Range (LoRa),\
    \ and the upper layers are\ncalled LoRaWAN. The latter is standardized by the\
    \ LoRa Alliance [33] and can reach distances of\nsome kilometers with a bandwidth\
    \ up to 50 Kbps and a typical payload of fewer than 100 bytes. The\nLoRaWAN architecture\
    \ comprises LoRa end-nodes (i.e., sensors and actuators) and LoRa gateways that\n\
    have an active IP connection and forwards LoRa packets to a centralized server.\
    \ The server is further\ndivided into network server (deals with network issues)\
    \ and application (App) server, dealing with\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n5 of 24\n\
    diﬀerent applications. LoRaWAN deﬁnes an ALOHA-based media access control protocol\
    \ on top of\nLoRa communication, as well as providing security features such as\
    \ authentication and cryptography.\nThere are diﬀerent ways of implementing the\
    \ LoRaWAN architecture: (a) Open source software\nthat can be installed in a cloud\
    \ datacenter or fog according to the scenario, such as ChirpStack [34],\npreviously\
    \ called LoRa Server; (b) The Things Network (TTN), a crowdfunded online community\n\
    that implements a LoRaWAN server and makes them available as a service (some services\
    \ are not\nfree, though) [35]; (c) Proprietary solutions, such as Loriot [36];\
    \ (d) The development of a new\nimplementation that means in practice reinventing\
    \ the wheel.\n2.3. Fog and Mist Computing for IoT\nFog computing is a new approach\
    \ for dealing with the enormous amount of data generated by\nIoT smart applications\
    \ [37]. It addresses three key challenges: (a) decreasing latency for real-time\n\
    application; (b) reducing data traﬃc between devices and cloud, and; (c) providing\
    \ a load balancing\nalternative to soften the processing burden of the cloud.\
    \ The fog metaphor is similar to the cloud\none, but the former is closer to the\
    \ ground and the people than the latter [38]. The underlying fog\ninfrastructure\
    \ is a virtualized platform that provides computing, storage, and communication\
    \ services\nbetween the users and the cloud datacenter [39]. In other words, fog\
    \ is the distributed computing\ninfrastructure for IoT. Here we consider fog computing\
    \ and edge computing as interchangeable terms,\neven though minor diﬀerences might\
    \ exist [40].\nWhile the fog aims at reducing bandwidth usage, latency, and data\
    \ communication with the\ndatacenter, mist computing extends this concept further\
    \ in IoT-based systems, closer to the sensors\nand actuators [12]. Although there\
    \ is no consensus about the deﬁnition of mist, some common\nunderstanding can\
    \ be found, such as being located closer to the devices [21,41]. Mist can be considered\n\
    the lowest level of a hierarchical fog computing system.\nUsually, mist nodes\
    \ host communication facilities, such as a LoRaWAN gateway or a Wi-Fi\naccess\
    \ point. Additionally, they can also host light processing and temporary storage,\
    \ typically using\nARM processors, such as Raspberry Pi and similar. According\
    \ to the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF), these devices belong to a category\
    \ of general-purpose constrained nodes, making the diﬀerence\nbetween sensing\
    \ devices based on microcontrollers [42]. The mist infrastructure may be composed\
    \ of\ndiﬀerent nodes working together to provide services to devices within the\
    \ same geographical area,\nwhich not necessarily are packed into the same box.\n\
    2.4. IoT Smart Applications\nThe IoT allows people and objects to be connected\
    \ at any time, from anywhere, using standard\nnetworks and protocols to access\
    \ innovative smart services. Sensors of diﬀerent natures in diﬀerent\nspaces coupled\
    \ with ubiquitous GPS-equipped smartphones, in addition to the resources available\
    \ in\ncore or edge datacenters, allow seamless automation of typical manual activities.\
    \ The use of a variety\nof combined technologies—such as IoT, cloud computing,\
    \ big data analytics (e.g., machine learning\ntechniques) and network softwarization-make\
    \ it possible to build a myriad of new smart applications\nto the beneﬁt of our\
    \ society.\nHere we use four IoT verticals as examples of smart applications,\
    \ namely smart cities, smart\nagriculture, smart healthcare, and smart industry.\
    \ Although other smart applications exist, these four\nones represent the majority\
    \ of currents eﬀorts where IoT has been applied in real cases [3]. Cities\nare\
    \ becoming smarter for citizens and municipal governments, as new and existing\
    \ technologies\nare increasingly used to the development of a substantial variety\
    \ of services and applications [6,7].\nIn farms, the use of technology to add\
    \ intelligence to agriculture still has a vast potential to generate\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances. Smart agriculture (or more broadly smart farming), depends on innovative\n\
    technologies to increase the productivity of crops and animal products, to make\
    \ eﬃcient use of precious\nresources like water, and to decrease the amount of\
    \ chemical substances used (e.g., medicines and\npesticides) [5]. Notably, we\
    \ have been involved in using IoT and machine learning solutions within the\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 84\n6 of 24\nSWAMP project, which develops IoT-based approaches\
    \ for smart water management for a precision\nirrigation application, and pilots\
    \ them in Italy, Spain, and Brazil [4]. Healthcare is an essential area for\n\
    introducing IoT, given its enormous potential to provide quality of life to the\
    \ society in applications\nsuch as elderly monitoring, chronic diseases, ﬁtness\
    \ programs, and remote treatment [8]. Finally,\nindustrial automation has been\
    \ experiencing a signiﬁcant change in the last years, which is due to the\nrecent\
    \ technological advances that allow more profound interconnection and improved\
    \ integration\nand production control [9].\nA critical concern in the development\
    \ of IoT smart applications is security [26,27,43].\nThe applications must deal\
    \ with data privacy, conﬁdentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability\n\
    of services. The four IoT verticals have similar security requirements to protect\
    \ the data. In healthcare,\nprivacy means the health records of the patients must\
    \ be appropriately secured, using adequate\nauthentication methods to avoid access\
    \ by non-authorized users, and secure communication for\nexchanged data [27].\
    \ The data integrity is also important since incorrect sensor measurements or\n\
    prescriptions can cause serious health problems to the patient. Most embedded\
    \ sensors and wearables\nused in healthcare have resource limitations, which makes\
    \ it challenging to use traditional security\nmechanisms, usually computationally\
    \ expensive. Since many IoT devices are limited in power,\nprocessing, and memory,\
    \ this is a challenge also for applications in smart cities, smart agriculture,\
    \ and\nsmart industry.\n2.5. Performance and Scalability of IoT Systems\nDiﬀerent\
    \ forecasts have been reporting the availability of billions of connected devices\
    \ in the\nnext years [1,2]. Since smart applications will typically have to deal\
    \ with thousands of devices-or\nconsiderably more-performance and scalability\
    \ concerns are key to any successful IoT deployment. Yet,\nmost current reported\
    \ experiences show: (a) small-scale pilots [7,44]; (b) simulation-based or analytical\n\
    results [21,45]; (c) measurement-based results with limited scope [19,46]; (d)\
    \ no quantitative results at\nall [2,3,5,8,9,11,12,16,24,37,47]. Also, diﬀerent\
    \ architectural and deployment choices for IoT systems\naﬀect scalability, and\
    \ real-time decision-making is possible in an environment composed of thousands\n\
    of sensors [4,48]. Therefore, understanding the tradeoﬀs involved in planning\
    \ and deploying diﬀerent\nsoftware components of a speciﬁc scenario on diﬀerent\
    \ location infrastructures-such as cloud, fog,\nor mist—requires careful consideration\
    \ of the performance and scalability of the solution.\nCruz et al. [19] proposed\
    \ qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluated the performance\nof various\
    \ IoT platforms. Out of 11 platforms initially analyzed by the qualitative approach,\
    \ ﬁve\nwere selected for the performance analysis. However, since they adopted\
    \ a generic approach, the\nauthors did not go into the speciﬁcs of individual\
    \ platforms, and they did not evaluate diﬀerent\ndeployment infrastructures.\n\
    Martínez et al. [46] gave a detailed description of a FIWARE testbed architecture\
    \ conﬁgured for\nprecision agriculture, which diﬀers from our approach, mainly\
    \ because our focus is to test diﬀerent\nconﬁgurations considering our IoTecture\
    \ and IoTinuum. Besides, their test application connects directly\nto Orion with\
    \ NGSI JSON, while we used an IoT Agent with an IoT sensor simulator that generates\n\
    synthetic data.\nThis paper diﬀers from previous work showing a performance analysis\
    \ study of six deployment\nconﬁgurations of FIWARE and LoRaWAN/LPWAN for smart\
    \ agriculture and smart city, involving\ndiﬀerent placement strategies of components\
    \ over fog and cloud infrastructures. It extends previous\npreliminary performance\
    \ results presented in [4] and [48], which focused on more speciﬁc scenarios of\n\
    smart irrigation.\n3. Architecting and Deploying IoT Smart Applications\nA complete\
    \ solution for IoT smart applications requires diﬀerent software, hardware, and\n\
    communication technologies working together and integrating a variety of platforms,\
    \ components,\nservices, and applications. These technologies play diﬀerent roles\
    \ and provide functions that operate in\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n7 of 24\ndiﬀerent\
    \ perspectives of the scenarios addressed by smart applications. Figure 1 depicts\
    \ our proposed\nIoTecture, a generic 5-layer architecture based on our previous\
    \ experience with the development of\nIoT smart applications [4,49]. We recognize\
    \ that a myriad of diﬀerent layered architectures may be\nconceived having in\
    \ mind diﬀerent target applications.\nNevertheless, IoTecture is the outcome of\
    \ both an analysis of the literature (Section 2) and an\niterative reﬁnement process,\
    \ and as such, it is eﬀectively used in the speciﬁcation of pilot deployment\n\
    scenarios, as well as performance analysis studies. Compared to the 5-layer IoT\
    \ architecture [12–14],\nour 5-layer one explicitly adds support for highly distributed\
    \ data management functions and separates\nphysical and data-driven models from\
    \ application services. Also, by clearly identifying and separating\ncomponents\
    \ that are logically bound to the data, model, and service layers, IoTecture actively\
    \ helps\nthe deployment of IoT smart applications over diﬀerent distributed locations\
    \ in the mist, fog, and\ncloud. From a software architecture point of view, components\
    \ of diﬀerent layers are implemented by\nservices—actually encapsulated into Docker\
    \ containers with an exposed API, therefore microservices.\nComponents inside\
    \ each layer serve as representative examples of diﬀerent alternatives that may\
    \ vary\naccording to characteristics, requirements, and constraints of applications\
    \ and users.\n•\nLayer 1 (L1-Device): Sensors, actuators, and communication technologies—both\
    \ wired and\nwireless—make up the lowest layer of the IoT architecture. Devices\
    \ are sensors and actuators that\nrepresent IoT things. Figure 1 depicts some\
    \ examples of Layer 1 components, such as industrial\nrobots, that have many sensors\
    \ to track their actions, and actuators to control engines that make\nthem move\
    \ according to diﬀerent degrees of freedom, both exchanging messages with a smart\n\
    industry application via wired and wireless communication technologies.\n•\nLayer\
    \ 2 (L2-Transport): Collecting data from sensors, making it available to data\
    \ management\nfunctions, receiving commands from application models, and sending\
    \ them to actuators require a\ngood deal of intermediate components to make it\
    \ happen. Figure 1 depicts some examples of\ngeneric data transport functions\
    \ for sensing and actuation purposes, such as: (a) IoT protocol\n(e.g., MQTT [50])\
    \ that sends data from IP speaking devices to place where they are transformed\n\
    or ﬁltered either by other components of this layer or by data management components;\n\
    (b) IoT protocol translator (e.g., FIWARE IoT Agent) converts data from IoT protocol\
    \ format\n(e.g., byte stream for MQTT) into its internal format within data management\
    \ components\n(e.g., NGSI/JSON [29] for FIWARE) and vice-versa; (c) Sensor data\
    \ endpoint (e.g., ChirpStack [34])\ntransports, unpacks and decodes data for speciﬁc\
    \ IoT wireless communication technologies such as\nLPWAN [16]; (d) Device register\
    \ deals with the myriad of connected devices; (e) Data encryption\nand Authentication,\
    \ Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is pervasively necessary for IoT\ncommunications\
    \ and included in Layer 2. A general function of data security and network/service\n\
    management are transversal functions, as all layers pervasively needed them (not\
    \ represented in\nFigure 1, though).\n•\nLayer 3 (L3-Data): Every stage of any\
    \ end-to-end IoT data ﬂow needs to deal with data in diﬀerent\nways, such as storing,\
    \ retrieving, distributing, transforming, and ﬁltering. Figure 1 depicts some\n\
    examples of generic data management functions, such as: (a) Context broker (e.g.,\
    \ FIWARE\nOrion [51]) for context data distribution and related storage system;\
    \ (b) Big data pipeline (e.g.,\nApache Kafka [52]) for raw data distribution and\
    \ replication; (c) Big data processing (e.g., Apache\nSpark [53]) for processing\
    \ large amounts of data; (d) Time series storage (e.g., CrateDB [54]) for\nhistorical\
    \ data, and; (e) Interfacing with external systems, such as weather forecast services,\
    \ online\ncity traﬃc management services and databases.\n•\nLayer 4 (L4-Model):\
    \ Represent application-speciﬁc models for any type of processing over data\n\
    collected from sensors and external systems, encompassing an assortment of algorithms,\
    \ equations,\nmethods and techniques that change the data into knowledge that\
    \ is used by end-users to change\nthe environment in a way that ﬁts their best\
    \ interests. For example, a smart irrigation application\nmay use soil and weather\
    \ data, as well as weather forecast information (external system), to feed\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 84\n8 of 24\nphysical and machine learning models to precisely compute\
    \ when and how much crops should\nbe irrigated [4].\n•\nLayer 5 (L5-Service):\
    \ Contains services that support the interfaces and the interaction with\nend-users\
    \ of smart applications. This layer encompasses all services, applications, and\
    \ graphical\ninterfaces that provide visualization of sensor data, sensing and\
    \ actuation infrastructures, analyses,\nchoices, and decisions, as well as commands\
    \ to change the state of the system. Figure 1 depicts\nfour IoT verticals as examples\
    \ of smart applications, namely smart agriculture, smart city, smart\nhealthcare,\
    \ and smart industry.\nSensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n8 of 24 \ninterfaces\

    \ and development. \nHowever, it does not provide indications on where these components\
    \ should be deployed–i.e., mist, \nfog, or cloud-in a naturally distributed IoT\
    \ smart application. As the end-to-end data flow occurring \nin a smart application\
    \ includes sensors deployed in the field whose data usually are processed in the\
    \ \ncloud, the deployment of architectural components is a complex task that may\
    \ vary according to the \ncharacteristics, requirements, and constraints of applications\
    \ and stakeholders. \nIn order to provide a clear view of the different deployment\
    \ locations for architectural \ncomponents, we developed the concept of an IoT\
    \ computing continuum (shortened to IoTinuum), \nshown in Figure 2. IoTinuum is\
    \ divided up into stages or deployment locations, which may vary \naccording to\
    \ characteristics of the existing infrastructure, and extends the concept of IoT-fog-cloud\
    \ \nContinuum [47]. IoTinuum is an approach of formalizing the highly distributed\
    \ infrastructure of IoT \nsystems and facilitating the creation of different deployment\
    \ views for the mapping between layered \narchitectural components into staged\
    \ locations. For the sake of this paper, we identify five stages: \nS1-Thing,\
    \ S2-Mist, S3-Fog, S4-Cloud, and S5-Terminal. \n• \nS1-Thing: represents the stage\

    \ \nAs shown in Section 3, the mapping between components of the layered IoTecture\
    \ into stages of \nthe IoTinuum may result in different deployment configurations,\
    \ depending on the characteristics, \nrequirements, and constraints of applications\
    \ and users. The performance of smart applications is \ninfluenced by different\

    \ through which the data flow has to pass in its way from sensors (S1-Thing) up\
    \ to the \ncloud (S4-Cloud)–and user (S5-Terminal)-and back to actuators (S1-Thing).\
    \ Depending on where \ncomponents are deployed and how they are connected, the\

    \ data to be processed, stored, and transmitted may increase or \ndecrease, thus\
    \ impacting performance metrics, such as response time. In this section, we conduct\

    \ of application and communication technologies. Figure 5 depicts \nsix deployment\
    \ configurations of layered IoTecture components into staged IoTinuum places \n\
    devised following four key design choices: \n• \nApplication independence: Layers\
    \ L4-Model and L5-Application of IoTecture represent specific \napplications.\
    \ This study addresses architectural components that comprise a common IoT \n\
    platform, oblivious of smart application particularities. Thus, application-specific\
    \ components \nare not included in our experiments. As applications must consume\
    \ data managed by L3-Data, \na simple Consumer component was added to represent\
    \ L4-Model as a generic data sink. As a \ndirect consequence of this choice, data\
    \ flows only in one way, from sensors to the consumer \nlocated at the cloud.\
    \ In other words, users are not involved, and therefore, L5-Service and \nT5-Terminal\
    \ are outside of the scope of this work. \n• \nCommunication independence: in\

    \ wherein we can increase the workload by abstracting a large \nnumber of sensors\
    \ using the SenSE sensor simulator [56] that generates data at different rates.\

    4.2. Experimental Design\nFigure 6 extends Figure 5, providing additional technical\
    \ information for the six deployment\nconﬁgurations introduced in, needed for\
    \ the clear understanding of both experiments and results.\n•\nSmart applications:\
    \ two scenarios of smart agriculture and smart city are considered in our\nexperiments.\
    \ The critical diﬀerence between them is the approach for sensor data generation.\n\
    In the smart agriculture scenario, we consider many soil moisture sensor probes,\
    \ continually\ngenerating and transmitting one data packet every 10 min. In the\
    \ smart city scenario, we consider\nvehicles playing the role of sensors that\
    \ communicate with a traﬃc light according to a Poisson\narrival rate. In both\
    \ scenarios, the SenSE sensor simulator synthetically generates sensor data.\n\
    •\nLPWAN Technology: data is generated by SenSE using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol\
    \ format in\nboth scenarios. Also, for LoRaWAN, sensor data packets are coded\
    \ according to the LoRa PHY\nformat and encrypted according to the AES algorithm\
    \ determined by the LoRaWAN standard.\nFor Generic LPWAN, plain sensor data is\
    \ transmitted directly to the receiving end, which is\nalways an MQTT broker.\
    \ There is a sizeable diﬀerence in the payload generated by SenSE in the\nconﬁgurations\
    \ with LoRaWAN and generic LPWAN. With LoRaWAN, SenSE sends ChirpStack a\nJSON\
    \ over MQTT message with information about the emulated LoRa modulation in addition\
    \ to\nthe actual encrypted payload, composing a message of 314 bytes. In the conﬁgurations\
    \ without\nLoRaWAN, SenSE sends an Ultralight 2.0-structured MQTT 65-byte message\
    \ to the IoT Agent,\nsigniﬁcantly smaller than the LoRa message\n•\nS1-Thing and\
    \ S2-Mist: the SenSE simulator abstracts L1-Device in both S1-Thing and S2-Mist\n\
    for all conﬁgurations. In other words, since our experiments are controlled and\
    \ performed in a\ntestbed, L1-Device is not present, except for the LoRa PHY format\
    \ that is generated by SenSE,\nin order to understand the real eﬀect of ChirpStack.\n\
    •\nChirpStack: an open source LoRa server composed of two main components, the\
    \ ChirpStack\nNetwork Server and the ChirpStack application server. Both communicate\
    \ via MQTT with each\nother and with sensors and actuators, as well as platform\
    \ components, e.g., FIWARE IoT Agent.\nAlso, they use Redis and PostgreSQL as\
    \ databases.\n•\nWAN Emulation: to emulate the network link between the fog and\
    \ the cloud, we used a WAN\nemulator (WANem) with 45 ms of latency and 5 ms of\
    \ jitter. We deﬁned the parameters to input\nin the WANem through a simple experiment\
    \ performed the ping command to a VM located in the\nAmazon cloud in São Paulo,\
    \ sent through 4G.\n•\nInfrastructure:\nexperiments were performed in an OpenStack-powered\
    \ private cloud.\nAs experiments were in a testbed, they are not inﬂuenced by\
    \ other virtual machines running in the\nsame physical servers. VMs for cloud\

    \ categories of metrics:\n•\nElapsed Time: The average time taken since a sensor\
    \ data point is generated by SenSE until the\nconsumer receives it. This metric\
    \ represents how long it takes for sensor data to be available to\nany subscribed\
    \ application. We present the Thing-to-Cloud Elapsed Time that encompasses the\n\
    end-to-end path taken by data from its inception by SenSE in S1-Thing up to its\
    \ consumption in\nS4-Cloud, and Thing-to-Fog Elapsed Time speciﬁcally for conﬁgurations\
    \ C1 and C2 that contains\nan L4-Model Consumer application in S4-Cloud.\n•\n\
    System metrics: CPU and RAM usage per Docker container, which allows observing\
    \ each\ncomponent, located in S3-Fog or in S4-Cloud, collected every 5 s.\n5.\
    \ Performance Analysis: Results\nFigure 7 summarizes the key results of Thing-to-Cloud\
    \ Elapsed Times for smart agriculture and\nsmart city for the six conﬁgurations\
    \ C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. The bars ﬁlled with horizontal, diagonal\nand zigzag\
    \ patterns mean that the experiments did not ﬁnish correctly due to higher workloads,\n\
    even after numerous repetitions. Also, conﬁguration C1 did not run at all for\
    \ smart agriculture with\n1500 messages per minute-15,000 sensor probes-as VMs\
    \ always failed shortly after the beginning of\nthe experiments.\nComparing both\
    \ scenarios, we can observe that smart city (Figure 7a) had a slightly better\
    \ result,\nespecially for the highest workload of each scenario. Those results\
    \ show that the components tested\nperformed better with messages arriving in\
    \ bursts-event-driven sensors-instead of messages arriving\nwith a constant ﬂow-time-driven\
    \ sensors. Notably, conﬁgurations, including LoRaWAN (C1, C4, and\nC5), achieved\
    \ higher scalability than the ones with generic LPWAN. Besides performing its\
    \ intrinsic\nfunction, ChirpStack works as a cushion for sensor data and softens\
    \ message spikes. Regarding an\noverall comparison of the experiments using LoRaWAN\
    \ (conﬁguration C1, C4, and C5) and generic\nLPWAN (conﬁguration C2, C3, and C6),\
    \ it can be noted that for lower workloads ChirpStack adds\nabout 200 ms to the\
    \ processing, since more software components are needed for addressing issues\n\
    such as security and authorization.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n17 of 24\n \nFigure\

    \ bars filled with horizontal, \ndiagonal and zigzag patterns mean that the experiments\
    \ did not finish correctly due to higher \nworkloads, even after numerous repetitions.\
    \ Also, configuration C1 did not run at all for smart \nagriculture with 1500\
    \ messages per minute-15,000 sensor probes-as VMs always failed shortly after\
    \ \nthe beginning of the experiments. \n \n(a) Smart Agriculture (time-driven\

    \ highest workload (1500 messages per minute), only\ntwo conﬁgurations ran up\
    \ smoothly to the end of the experiments without failing, namely C4 and C5.\n\
    This result was not expected since C6 failed, and it is the lightest conﬁguration\
    \ in terms of the number\nof software components that are placed in the robust\
    \ VM in the cloud. Nevertheless, both scenarios\nhighlight the stability and scalability\
    \ of conﬁgurations C4 and C5, mainly due to the improved data\nﬂow control of\
    \ ChirpStack. On the other hand, when the workload is placed directly on the IoT\
    \ Agent,\nthe experiment fails, e.g., C6.Conﬁgurations C1 and C2 use a heavy fog,\
    \ where the Consumer uses\ndata directly in S3-Fog, allowing applications to process\
    \ part of the data closer to the user and thus to\nrespond to changes in real-time.\n\
    In Figure 8, we see that for C1, most of the time budget is elapsed up to S3-Fog,\
    \ whereas for C2,\nthe time to reach and process data in the cloud dominates the\
    \ path for both scenarios. This behavior\ncomes from the ChirpStack processing\

    \ and scalability. Some findings are worth \nhighlighting: \n• \nThe LoRaWAN IoT\

    for the smart city scenario due to spikes in CPU usage as depicted in Figure 9.\
    \ A few seconds \nafter a certain threshold of messages per second is reached,\
    \ the CPU usage goes up to 100%, and \nFigure 8. Device-to-Fog elapsed time for\

    \ components, located both in S3-Fog and\nS4-Cloud, which helped us to understand\
    \ the behavior of the elapsed time metric. In all experiments\nthat did not ﬁnish\
    \ correctly, the cause was a failure in IoT Agent. However, it is relevant to\
    \ notice\nthat we used two diﬀerent implementations: (a) a specially developed\
    \ LoRaWAN IoT Agent; (b) the\nFIWARE oﬃcial Ultralight 2.0 IoT Agent. Although\
    \ both play the same role in converting IoT protocols\ninto NGSI JSON and share\
    \ the same programing language–JavaScript using Node.js–they diﬀer in\nterms of\
    \ performance and scalability. Some ﬁndings are worth highlighting:\n•\nThe LoRaWAN\
    \ IoT Agent located at S3-Fog crashes in conﬁguration C1 with the high workload\n\
    for the smart city scenario due to spikes in CPU usage as depicted in Figure 9.\
    \ A few seconds after\na certain threshold of messages per second is reached,\
    \ the CPU usage goes up to 100%, and this\ncomponent presents a type of instability\
    \ similar to a phase transition, leading it to crash soon after\n341 s of the\
    \ experiment.\n•\nThe Ultralight 2.0 IoT Agent located at both S3-Fog and S4-Cloud\
    \ crashes in conﬁgurations C2,\nC3, and C5 with the high workload for the smart\
    \ agriculture scenario due to a linear and constant\nincrease in memory usage.\
    \ Figure 10a shows it keeps allocation memory up to 239 s and crashes,\nwhich\
    \ corresponds to the CPU usage of MongoDB, and also Orion, at S4-Cloud. Figure\
    \ 10b shows\nthat after the IoT Agent crashes, the CPU usage of MongoDB drops\
    \ from more than 70% to almost\nzero after 40 s. In other words, the crash of\
    \ the IoT Agent in S3-Fog is instead a consequence of\nanother performance bottleneck\
    \ located at S4-Cloud. The service time of the IoT Agent is shorter\nthan the\
    \ joint service time of Orion and MongoDB so that the former queues messages waiting\
    \ for\nHTTP REST requests to be answered by the latter. In other words, the IoT\
    \ Agent waits for a TCP\nACK packet to free the memory allocated for the messages.\
    \ As the message ﬂow is constant in the\nsmart agriculture scenario, the memory\
    \ allocated by the IoT Agent increases boundlessly up to a\npoint the operating\
    \ system fails to provide more space, and it crashes. The high usage of CPU by\n\
    MongoDB does not aﬀect the performance of the platform since the IoT Agent crashes\
    \ before the\ndatabase starts to present signiﬁcant problems.\n•\nChirpStack is\
    \ a well-developed and stable software component that adequately uses system\n\
    resources. The combined CPU Usage of all individual components that make up ChirpStack\n\
    was around 40% for high workloads and 6% for low workloads, whereas the sum of\
    \ memory\nusage was approximately 30 MB for high workloads and 22 MB for low workloads.\
    \ Except for\nC1, all the conﬁgurations that crashed during the experiments were\
    \ not based on LoRaWAN and\nconsequently did not use ChirpStack. We conclude that,\
    \ in addition to performing his LoRaWAN\nfunctions, the ChirpStack also works\
    \ as a cushion for sensor data that softens message spikes that\nprevent IoT Agent\
    \ to queue too many messages.\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n19 of 24\n•\nThe smart agriculture\
    \ and smart city scenarios presented a similar performance for low and medium\n\
    workloads. In those cases, the diﬀerence in the probability distribution for message\
    \ generation\ndid not impact the system performance, unlike for high workloads,\
    \ where all experiments with\nGeneric LPWAN (no ChirpStack) crashed for smart\
    \ agriculture. On the other hand, in the smart\ncity scenario, conﬁgurations C2\
    \ and C5 ran to the end of the experiment, and C3 was the only one\nwith LoRaWAN\
    \ that faced problems. This behavior indicates that the system can better handle\n\
    traﬃc in bursts than in a constant ﬂow of messages, because the time between bursts\
    \ is enough for\nOrion to dequeue some messages and send ACKs back to the IoT\
    \ Agent, freeing some memory in\nthe process.\n \nresources. The combined CPU\

    \ as a cushion for sensor data that softens \nmessage spikes that prevent IoT\
    \ Agent to queue too many messages. \n• \nThe smart agriculture and smart city\
    \ scenarios presented a similar performance for low and \nmedium workloads. In\
    \ those cases, the difference in the probability distribution for message \ngeneration\
    \ did not impact the system performance, unlike for high workloads, where all\
    \ \nexperiments with Generic LPWAN (no ChirpStack) crashed for smart agriculture.\
    \ On the other \nhand, in the smart city scenario, configurations C2 and C5 ran\
    \ to the end of the experiment, and \nC3 was the only one with LoRaWAN that faced\
    \ problems. This behavior indicates that the \nsystem can better handle traffic\
    \ in bursts than in a constant flow of messages, because the time \nbetween bursts\
    \ is enough for Orion to dequeue some messages and send ACKs back to the IoT \n\
    Agent, freeing some memory in the process. \n \nFigure 9. CPU usage of S3-Fog\

    \ Performance and Scalability Concerns\nBy analyzing the performance results shown\
    \ in Section 5, we can understand that diﬀerent\ndeployment conﬁgurations of layered\
    \ IoTecture components into staged IoTinuum places generate\ndiﬀerent hardware\
    \ and software bottlenecks as far as the use of system resources is concerned.\
    \ Also,\nthat directly aﬀects the critical application metric to determine the\
    \ duration of data transfer (elapsed\ntime) from its inception in S1-Thing by\
    \ SenSE to its consumption in S4-Cloud by the consumer. Also,\nour results show\
    \ that individual software components have diﬀerent scalability behaviors that\
    \ may\nchange when they are connected to each other.\nThe complexity in understanding\
    \ diﬀerent tradeoﬀs complicates the choice of particular\ndeployment conﬁgurations\
    \ for speciﬁc IoT smart applications. In those cases, the help of an expert\n\
    on the IoT platform will be required to correctly identify the most suitable set\
    \ of components and\nconﬁguration deployment for each scenario, considering typical\
    \ workloads, as well as characteristics\nand constraints of the infrastructure\
    \ and applications.\nWe believe that our concepts related to\narchitecting and\
    \ deploying IoT smart applications, together with the practical performance analysis\n\
    results, increased the understanding and awareness involved in the development\
    \ and operation of\na new breed of IoT-enabled systems. However, there is still\
    \ the need for automating the process of\napplication deployment, not only the\
    \ static procedures for conﬁguring and installing an application\ninto the stages\
    \ of IoTinuum, but also the dynamic analysis which may generate consequent system\n\
    reconﬁgurations. The issue of static and dynamic conﬁguration is currently an\
    \ open research question.\nOur experiments revealed that FIWARE general enablers—in\
    \ their current version—are not\ndesigned for higher workload applications, which\
    \ is a paradox because IoT Platforms should be\nintrinsically able to deal with\
    \ thousands or millions of sensors simultaneously. When a FIWARE-based\nIoT platform\
    \ is submitted to a workload of 1500 messages per minute, the system crashes due\
    \ to the\nmalfunctioning of the Ultralight IoT Agent. As IoT smart applications\
    \ must handle a large number of\nconnected devices sending messages continuously,\
    \ 25 messages per second should not be considered\na workload high enough to cause\
    \ the system to fail. Therefore, even though Orion is considered a\nstable component,\
    \ its joint use with the IoT Agent produces a bottleneck that puts a ceiling in\
    \ the\nsystem scalability. This problem was not identiﬁed before in the literature\
    \ because most FIWARE-based\nimplementations are not deployed in large-scale scenarios–i.e.,\
    \ thousands of devices connected, as they\nfocus on simple examples with just\
    \ a few sensors, which does not stress the system enough to detect\nsystem bottlenecks.\
    \ The scalability of IoT platforms—–FIWARE, in our case—to support the operation\n\
    of applications using thousands or millions of sensors is another open research\
    \ question.\nWhen it comes to the six conﬁgurations analyzed in our experiments,\
    \ we conclude that all of them\nhave a practical use, depending on requirements,\
    \ characteristics, constraints, and workload of smart\napplications and deployment\
    \ scenarios. For example, in a scenario with stricter constraints on low\nlatency,\
    \ e.g., the smart city scenario for automated traﬃc lights, LoRaWAN powered by\
    \ ChirpStack\nmay not fulﬁll the demand. Also, such a conﬁguration may require\
    \ data to be consumed in the\nfog (S3-Fog), in order to avoid the latency of the\
    \ network link between the edge device (S1-Thing)\nand the cloud (S4-Cloud). On\
    \ the other hand, in smart agriculture, usually, there is no need for low\nlatency.\
    \ However, in some agriculture frontiers such as in the countryside of Brazil,\
    \ highly unstable\ninternet connections between S3-Fog and S4-Cloud are still\
    \ common. Thus, application uptime can\nbe increased, if it can survive to disconnections\
    \ from S4-Cloud by processing simpler models in\nS3-Fog, e.g., conﬁgurations C1\
    \ and C2 where Orion and consumer are placed in S3-Fog. Increasing the\nunderstanding\
    \ and awareness of design choices and best practices for deploying layered IoTecture\n\
    components into staged IoTinuum is an open research question.\nConﬁgurations C3\
    \ and C4 rely on a lightweight S3-Fog only for communication purposes,\nsince\
    \ they have no way of consuming data locally. This choice lies in the fact farm\
    \ infrastructure\nand connectivity with the Internet may be harnessed, but the\
    \ local server installed in S3-Fog may\nSensors 2020, 20, 84\n21 of 24\ncontinuously\
    \ be under a low workload, so that its resources may be used in some creative\
    \ ways, such\nas load balancing. This behavior was observed in the experiments\
    \ with C4, which achieved better\nresults compared to C6, where everything is\
    \ processed in S4-Cloud. However, the opposite happened\nwith C3, due to the poor\
    \ scalability of IoT Agent. Therefore, using up idle capacity in S3-Fog requires\n\
    careful analysis and an improved understanding of the behavior of speciﬁc software\
    \ components. The\ntradeoﬀs in using fog resources are another open research question.\n\
    6.2. IoT Architectural Layers vs. Deployment Stages\nIoTecture architectural layers\
    \ paired together with IoTinuum deployment stages provide a simple\nand unambiguous\
    \ way to bind software, hardware, and communication components to physical\ninfrastructure\
    \ in an IoT context. The physical location where a software component is executed\
    \ has\na high impact on the performance and brings diﬀerent tradeoﬀs, as revealed\
    \ by our performance\nanalysis results. IoT smart applications have their speciﬁc\
    \ characteristics and peculiarities regarding\nthe location of physical infrastructure—stages\
    \ S2-Mist, S3-Fog, and S4-Cloud—compared to traditional\nWeb-based distributed\
    \ applications.\nThere is no direct association between speciﬁc layers and stages,\
    \ even though some choices make\nfor sense than others. For example, components\
    \ from layers L2-Transport, L3-Data, L4-Model, and\neven L5-Service can be deployed\
    \ into an intermediary stage, such as conﬁgurations C1 and C2 that\nplaced L2-Transport\
    \ to L4-Model components into S3-Fog. On the other hand, all of them can be\n\
    executed in S4-Cloud, such as conﬁgurations C5 and C6. Also, if S3-Fog implements\
    \ a lightweight fog\nwith no local L4-Model, there is no way to consume data locally\
    \ from an edge device. Conﬁgurations\nbased on lightweight S3-Fog for communication\
    \ only are not able to consume data locally or decrease\napplication latency,\
    \ avoiding long internet delays. However, they can still be used for load balance\n\
    purposes. Also, we evaluated conﬁgurations where ChirpStack is deployed in S3-Fog\
    \ and S4-Cloud.\nEven though it could be installed in S2-Mist, we do not consider\
    \ it a stable solution, since the mist node\nmay not adequately fulﬁll the performance\
    \ and reliability requirements of IoT smart applications.\nApplications requiring\
    \ strict compliance with low latency—such as smart city applications—should\n\
    be designed having in mind layer L4-Service deployed in stages S2-Mist or 3S-Fog,\
    \ as data can be\nconsumed locally, thus, faster. On the other hand, for applications\
    \ with an unstable connection between\nS1-Thing and S4-Cloud—e.g., smart agriculture\
    \ applications—there is the need to store and process\ndata in an intermediary\
    \ stage, for increased uptime. Thus, such applications should have L3-Data\ncomponents\
    \ running in S2-Mist or S3-Fog. Here we presented some preliminary insights related\
    \ to the\ndeployment of layered components into staged locations, and further\
    \ research is necessary to provide\nmethods, mechanisms, algorithms, and best\
    \ practices to avoid the need of a specialist and allow an\nautomated deployment\
    \ process.\n6.3. Limitations and Future Work\nThis article does not exhaust the\
    \ subject of designing IoT architectures and using them to guide\nand support\
    \ the deployment of software, hardware, and networking components over distributed\n\
    locations. Examples of limitations of this article that are left as future work\
    \ include: (a) evaluating the\nperformance of components located in higher layers,\
    \ i.e., L4-Model and L5-Service; (b) automating\nthe deployment process, and;\
    \ (c) using diﬀerent technology sets. The performance analysis of higher\nlayer\
    \ components has not inherent challenges, though the results would be highly dependent\
    \ on\nspeciﬁc applications. On the other hand, we have already started to develop\
    \ an automated process\nfor application deployment, both for generating static\
    \ conﬁgurations at installation time, but also for\ndynamic on-the-ﬂy adaptation.\n\
    The set of IoT platforms and LPWAN technologies used in the performance analysis\
    \ study was\nﬁxed. Whereas FIWARE is a well-known IoT platform with a large user\
    \ base, other ones might reveal\ndiﬀerent results and trade-oﬀs, such as InterSCity\
    \ [60], Konker [61], and ThingsBoard [62]. As for\nLPWAN technologies, our study\
    \ only focused on LoRaWAN due to the do-it-yourself approach that\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 84\n22 of 24\nfacilitates installing and using it. On the other hand, experimenting\
    \ with NB-IoT and SigFox with\na large number of sensors will require the development\
    \ of realistic emulation platforms based on\nextensive measurements with these\
    \ LPWAN technologies to capture their behaviors. Besides, other\nopen-source LoRaWAN\
    \ servers, such as the one provided by The Things Networks, could be compared\n\
    with ChirpStack.\n7. Conclusions\nAlthough IoT architectures play an essential\
    \ role in the design of distributed smart applications,\nthe development of IoT\
    \ platforms derived from these architectures and their deployment into\nreal scenarios\
    \ yield diﬀerent tradeoﬀs and thus require an improved understanding. We proposed\n\
    a layered IoT architecture (called IoTecture) whose components are mapped to stages\
    \ of an IoT\ncomputing continuum (called IoTinuum) in diﬀerent deployment conﬁgurations.\
    \ A performance\nanalysis study with six conﬁgurations revealed that diﬀerent\
    \ deployment conﬁgurations of layered\ncomponents into staged locations generate\
    \ diﬀerent hardware and software bottlenecks that aﬀect\nsystem performance and\
    \ scalability. Scalability problems that aﬀect FIWARE components under high\n\
    workloads were revealed.\nAuthor Contributions: I.Z., A.H., and D.S. designed\

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Get rights and content Abstract The development of industrialization and information
    communication technology (ICT) has deeply changed our way of life. In particular,
    with the emerging theory of “Industry 4.0”, the integration of cloud technologies
    and industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) becomes increasingly important, as
    this will greatly improve the manufacturing chain and business services. In this
    paper, we first describe the development and character of ICPS. ICPS will inevitably
    play an important role in manufacturing, sales, and logistics. With the support
    of the cloud, ICPS development will impact value creation, business models, downstream
    services, and work organization. Then, we present a service-oriented ICPS model.
    With the support of the cloud, infrastructure platform and service application,
    ICPS will promote the manufacturing efficiency, increase quality of production,
    enable a sustainable industrial system and more environmentally friendly businesses.
    Thirdly, we focus on some key enabling technologies, which are critical in supporting
    smart factories. These key enabling technologies will also help companies to realize
    high quality, high output, and low cost. Finally, we talk about some challenges
    of ICPS implementation and the future work. Previous article in issue Next article

    wireless networks 1. Introduction The rapid development of information communication
    technologies (ICTs) has significantly changed design, manufacturing, logistics,
    and service. Especially in the process of Industry 4.0, due to the deep integration
    of micro controller and physical devices, our machines and tools are becoming
    more automated and self-sufficient, increasingly replacing manual labor. The integration
    of computing, communication, and control technologies has led to developments
    in real-time sensing, the dynamic control of large-scale engineering systems,
    information services, and production life cycle management (PLCM). Yet these technologies
    still do not fulfill our needs. The final aims of cyber physical systems (CPS)
    [1], [2], [3] are to realize “intelligent monitoring” and “intelligent control”.
    These are the processes which need to realize real-time information extraction,
    data analysis, decision making and data transmission. On the other hand, the human
    race is meeting two tremendous challenges: global climate change and the energy
    crisis. The demands of sustainable development and green business have become
    more prominent in our daily life, and ICT as a key support to optimize manufacturing
    chain will play an important role in it. So, the work of integration of physical
    world and cyber world is inevitable [4], [5], [6]. And many countries has made
    CPS as a national development strategy and put it on the top of the priority list.
    Germany’s implementation of Industry 4.0 has received great attention in the business
    world, resulting in more companies wanting to improve their manufacturing chains
    to realize it. CPS is effective in combining computation with a physical process,
    thus achieving the goal of integration of industrialization and ICT [7]. Furthermore,
    CPS combines embedded computers, networks, sensors, and actuators [8], [9], which
    are important for smart manufacturing. Such as in the process of PLCM, ICPS will
    help meet customer demand by monitoring every part of production, realizing real-time
    logistics, and providing comprehensive customer services. Additionally, applications
    of CPS will have the giant potential to change the world in many fields [10].
    These include population crisis, environment protection, health care, easing transportation
    pressure, the control of smart grids, saving energy, etc. It is also easy to envision
    new capabilities, such as supply to manufacturing chains, to realize smart production,
    smart logistics, smart grids and real-time services. Currently, due to the increased
    popularity of smart manufacturing and smart factories, ICPS cannot fulfill our
    demand. In the process of Industry 4.0, traditional industries are hard to integrate
    industrial sources, social sources and share them [11]. What is more, companies
    need more hardware and software platforms to optimize their industry chains. Moreover,
    the fast growing data volume is hard to process. But now, the ICPS technologies
    cannot support ultra-fast computing and high throughout reliable networks, which
    are essential for businesses. Without enough resources, it cannot provide real-time
    and reliable services to corporations. Thus, an industrial cloud to support to
    ICPS will be highly beneficial. Industrial clouds will supply all kinds of manufacturing
    services and realize the open collaboration between manufacturing resources and
    services, as well as to enable a high degree of social resource sharing. Moreover,
    this will supply a big platform to generate a series of new service models for
    PLCM, including supply standards, specifications, and sharing resources. Meanwhile,
    industrial cloud will take more optimization to ICPS that now discussed. 1.1.
    Provide distributed fast computing With the development of big data and cloud
    computing, the multi-channel distributed computing method achieves fast computational
    speed. What is more, the cloud can supply a big source pool to store, process,
    and analyze these data, which will generate accurate data information and reduce
    costs. 1.2. Provide flexibility and scalability services Everyday, there are numerous
    data and application uploads on the cloud. These sources can be easily searched
    by enterprises to help them ascertain customers’ demand, design products and manage
    products life cycle. Meanwhile, the cloud can be as a big platform for every company
    to storage their data, analysis their information and utilize these upload application
    to optimize their manufacturing chain, increase their production efficiency and
    reduce cost. 1.3. Provide security Private, public, and hybrid clouds all contain
    many high-reliability security mechanisms to provide safe service. This is similar
    to the scheme of “end-to-end security”, which is used to ensure information security
    in the process of sending and receiving e-mails. Moreover, with the support of
    clouds [12], [13], data storage and exchange become faster and faster, which enables
    the construction of intelligent factories. In the industrial environment, with
    the support of the cloud, the CPS system will promote the objects of production
    directly or via the Internet to achieve independent information exchange, operation
    and mutual manipulation through machine to machine (M2M) communication [14]. This
    model will make great progress in the industrial processes of manufacturing, industrial
    engineering, material utilization, supply chain management and PLCM. Just like
    the expression in the Fig. 1, ICPS will focus on the building of smart factories
    and through cloud to combine them with smart mobility, smart grids, smart buildings,
    smart production and smart logistics. Furthermore, the cloud will augment optimize
    industry chain, increase production efficiency, data exchanges and applications
    [15], [16]. The cloud is like a huge resource pool. In any process of the ICPS,
    we can deploy services via the cloud to acquire our required information and help
    us improve our service chain. Furthermore, the cloud can be used as a storage
    server and information exchange tool, making the manufacturing chain more flexible
    and usable to provide customers with goods of higher quality and personalization

    image Fig. 1. The structure of cloud-assisted ICPS. However, in the implementation
    of ICPS, we can find obvious gaps between the ideal situation and reality. Cloud-assisted
    ICPS needs high integration of the cyber world (which includes communication technologies,
    computing technologies, big data, etc.) and the physical world (which includes
    industrial manufacturing chains, sensors, actuators, etc.) [18]. The development
    of these enabling technologies will determine the realization of ICPS. In this
    paper, we explore the novel service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS model. We express
    the views that against the backdrop of Industry 4.0, this model will substantially
    improve production chains and can realize smart manufacturing and smart factories.
    Next, according to the demand of ICPS, we depict some key enabling technologies
    and show their larger applications in industry. We also discuss challenges that
    will be met in this process and propose solutions. With the support of the cloud
    and integration of the cyber and physical worlds, our approach can actualize smart
    mobility, smart grids, smart logistics and smart products. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 addresses the architecture of service-oriented
    ICPS. Section 3 talks about some key enabling technologies that are used in ICPS.
    Section 4 depicts the challenges that are needed to solve existing challenges.
    In Section 5, we express our predictions and discuss future work. 2. Architecture
    of service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS Due to the fast development of our society
    and fast consumption of resources, sustainability becomes an important issue and
    garners attention. Two key ICT technologies provide an important role in the sustainability
    of industrial systems: service-oriented architectures (SOA) and CPS [19], [20].
    SOA’s advantages make it suitable for a growing number of industrial systems,
    including integration flexibility and the ability for processes to be composed.
    CPS involves the integration of the computational and physical worlds. In factories,
    the same principles apply as in the personal sector [21], [22]. With the perfection
    of infrastructure service platform, it will make automation more easily. All kinds
    of sensors perceive the physical information around them, and transform these
    data to control centers. Then, the control centers will give the order to actuators
    to change a station. It uses the method of embedded systems to integrate computation,
    sensors and actuators in devices [23]. Then, industrial networks supply the support
    of M2M communication, break the limitation of source constraints, and achieve
    resource sharing and distributed computing. Among network layers, numerous devices
    link the Internet. These computers, storage devices and control devices can be
    integrated as services and provide support to accomplish specific tasks, and provide
    virtual computing for terminals [24]. These may also create many applications
    for industries. These software component technologies, including object-oriented
    design and service-oriented architectures, are built on abstractions that match
    software better than physical systems [25], [26]. These features will improve
    convenience in the personal and industrial sectors. In the near future, information
    will be the core resource of every enterprise. Every company will endeavor to
    provide the best services to their customers. By searching customers’ demand,
    data on the manufacture of products, customer service, and PLCM will be available
    to industries, which is just the core of quality of service (QoS). Thus, big data
    and cloud services will inevitably play an important role in our daily manufacturing
    [27], [28]. With these cloud service platform, we can easily storage and analyze
    our data, exchange information among companies, integrate production chain between
    enterprises and transform our production mode. But we must think about several
    questions, such as how to find the demands of customers, what machines should
    cooperate with others, where is the best place for selling, and what is the problem
    with our product. The answers will easily find through cloud and obviously provide
    significant improvement to companies. As we show in the Fig. 2, in the process
    of implement of service-oriented cloud-assisted ICPS, we can divide it as three
    steps. The first is to deploy infrastructure to make equipments become smart and
    can communication with others. The second step is to supply them platform for
    processing their data and information. The last is to provide various applications
    to promote their production efficiency and industrial chain. What’s more, cloud
    multimedia services can provide an efficient, flexible, and scalable data processing
    method and offer a solution for the user demands of high quality and diversified

    user’s demand, so we can provide high quality, high speed, humanization, individualization
    and real-time service [29]. Download : Download high-res image (582KB) Download

    will focus on the SOA’s following advantages that are essential for industrial
    system. 2.1. Comprehensive and distributed services For every company, these comprehensive
    and distributed services provide support to manage their workflows, optimize their
    manufacturing chains, provide high quality and low price product to their customers,
    etc. With the various kinds and different levels of services to choose from, our
    enterprises can select the most fitting server depending on the timeliness, reliability
    and energy efficiency desired. For instance, a company can accurately find the
    customers’ demand and give them real-time help, which is based on the data that
    was composed from customers’ location, hobby, context-aware searching [30], [31]
    and some others. 2.2. Transparency services In industrial systems, we may often
    encounter equipment that can’t be extended to more applications due to the core
    layer limits. Because, every enterprise prefer selling their products to selling
    their technologies because these data and technologies is their lifeline and they
    do not want to share with others. This is just a problem of protecting private
    information. However, for service-oriented architectures, the services will be
    transparent for all the industries and they can easily monitor the performance
    of all the devices and find problems in a timely fashion. 2.3. Service security
    An increasing number of data attacks and information leakage has influenced the
    core interests of enterprises. It may even destroy the industrial chain just like
    the Iran petroleum system accident. For another part, many companies may spend
    much more money to buy some well-known security mechanisms to protect their workflow.
    However, these mechanisms are not suitable for ICPS networks and systems because
    they can’t provide any fine-grain access control. Service-oriented architecture,
    on the other hand, allows fine grain access control on every service and method
    on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to the end-to-end plugins that are made
    by Google, which provides terminal-to-terminal email encryption. User data will
    be encrypted when it leaves the browsers, and will be decrypted when the message
    is received by the recipient. Comparing the ICPS and traditional manufacturing
    systems, we can find that, with the support of cloud and some other technologies,
    the industrial manufacturing will become more efficient, flexible, fast and humanized.
    Just as show in Table 1, the ICPS will help us to realize sustainable manufacturing
    and green business. Table 1. The compare with traditional manufacturing system
    and ICPS. Type Traditional manufacturing system ICPS Production mode Manual control,

    production and smart logistics provide real-time products Personal-oriented service

    life cycle and provides customer service 3. Key enabling technologies During the
    process of ICPS, WSN, internet of things, industrial cloud technologies and some
    other enabling technologies will take so much promotion to it. We can divide ICPS
    into three levels, the first is infrastructure that is aim to connect every device
    and realize smart interoperability. This process can be represented as M2M communication
    that is committed to make all of machines connective. The second level is network
    level, which is to achieve intelligent communication. In which, industrial wireless
    network plays an important role. The top level is cloud, which is a big service
    platform to storage information, analysis data, supply applications, etc. 3.1.
    Industrial cloud technologies ICPS is the process of integrating computation into
    manufacturing chains and other areas of LCM. It is necessary to process the data
    that come from different companies, different devices and various communication
    networks. Then, we need to analyze it and acquire the key information for our
    daily production, which is the format of smart manufacturing. Furthermore, with
    the support of cloud technologies, it will generate an increasing number of applications
    to improve the manufacturing chain. 3.1.1. Industrial cloud computing Due to the
    explosive growth of data volume and real-time service concept, we need more rapid
    methods to deal with these data. Cloud computing will change the traditional way
    of passive market research model and use the active perception, discovery to realize
    accurate insight into market information. In addition, cloud computing is to use
    public servers and network device [32]. It will reduce most cost on equipment
    and allows companies to focus on increasing their core value services. What’s
    more, due to the advantages of cloud platform, most service system is scalability
    and flexibility. It can easy to transplant to another platform. In industrial
    manufacturing chains, due to the demand of manufacturing and PLCM, cloud computing
    is different from traditional cloud technologies and has its own characteristics.
    In the information age, the core competitiveness of a company is fast information
    and real-time responses, which require the cloud technologies to provide fast,
    accurate and uninterrupted computing from social resources and manufacturing resources.
    In another part, Industry 4.0 will generate countless data from various domains
    like sensors, machines, social networks and LCM. This means the cloud computing
    must integrate these data and find the useful information. The growing popularity
    of social computing, which is used to help people understand and study the various
    problems in the social sciences, and promote benefits and an enhanced level of
    human social activities through ICT. In industries, this technology will help
    business to analyze the social behavior and computational system to find social
    demand, and optimize life cycle management. Now, with the increase of social computing
    platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Skype and YouTube, it will speed the development
    of intelligent manufacturing and provide personalized and real-time service to
    customers. 3.1.2. Industrial big data Big data and cloud computing are highly
    interdependent. Without cloud computing, big data is useless and vice versa. Now,
    with the development of industrialization, the quantity of machines have several
    times as many as human beings, and the amount of data generated from manufacturing
    chains continually increases. Industrial sensors, radio frequency identification
    systems, bar codes, industrial automation control systems, enterprise resource
    planning, computer aided design and other technologies are increasingly rich in
    industrial data volume. These data are huge and unstructured, which is difficult
    to process, so we must use some professional tools to solve it. Recently, however,
    applications can process these big data within a “tolerable elapsed time” [33].
    The goal of industrial CPS is to find the customers’ demand and provide personalized
    product and real-time PLCM, so it is necessary to collect and analyze these data
    [34]. The most challenging aspect is to explore the large volumes of data and
    extract useful information or knowledge for future actions [35]. In our survey,
    there are 48 h of video uploaded to YouTube, 100 thousand statuses in twitter,
    and billions of other messages every minute. What’s more, these data have high
    volume, variety data types and formats, so we must use some special database and
    hardware environments to collect and process them. The volume of data is very
    large (as large as exa-bytes), and arises from various domains, including public
    information, sensors, climate and other channels [36], [37], [38]. Several new
    types of “octopus” data collection platforms now exist, the most common tools
    including the following. (1) ScraperWiki [39], a web-based platform for collaboratively
    building programs to extract and analyze public (online) data. (2) Needlebase
    [40], which can schedule a scraper to run at regular intervals, while re-formatting
    data to clarify it, filter it, or make it compatible with other sets of data.
    Then, it visualizes and combines data from more than one source. (3) Hadoop [41]
    contains a distributed file system (HDFS), and supports high error tolerance.
    It can be deployed in low-cost hardware to increase throughput. (4) Thingspeak
    [42] is a free web service hosted by an I/O bridge that lets you collect and store
    sensor data and develop IoT applications. The data from multiple sensors can be
    sent to ThingSpeak from Arduino, Raspberry Pi and some others. Then, ThingSpeak
    can integrate with matlab to analyze and visualize these data, etc. As shown in
    Fig. 3, all kinds of applications collect these initial data and store them in
    different ways. Due to the different structure of data, we need to extract and
    integrate them. Then, we use some professional algorithm to analyze it and find
    the useful information like customers’ demand, transport conditions, weather changes
    and medical status. We can image a scene that when we share our new ideas of some
    products with friends through social networking, we may never wish to realize
    these functions right now. However, with the support of cloud technologies, enterprises
    can use data mining to search your demands, then use 3D printing to produce personalized
    product and deliver the goods to you through smart logistics. Download : Download

    of data processing. 3.2. Industrial wireless networks In the form of modern intelligent
    manufacturing, the maximum demand is to realize collaboration among companies,
    devices and terminals. This corporate synergy takes the form of horizontal integration,
    which is to gather the advantages of various companies to provide better services.
    However, in an enterprise, the demand is to coordinate each device to work together
    and produce better goods. The end-to-end integration aims to use sensors, controllers
    and actuators to realize intelligent monitoring [43], [44], intelligent manufacturing,
    intelligent logistics, and real-time communication. In this process, the most
    important thing is information exchange, which includes information interactions
    between devices, companies, and clouds [45]. Especially in our manufacturing chain,
    where all kinds of machines, sensors, and equipment must work at the same time,
    we don’t have enough workers to perform these tasks. Instead, we transmit some
    program to these machines to make them work by themselves and even some places
    where people can’t reach, which is needed for remote operation. In this scenario,
    wireless networking as a substitute for traditional Ethernet has a big advantage.
    In the ICPS, Industrial wireless networking is an important link and safeguard
    technology between machines, terminals and cloud [46], [47]. It will allow us
    to flexibly communicate with any piece of equipment without any restrictions of
    time and place [48], [49], [50]. Moreover, it will provide support when we want
    to ascertain the demand. A wireless network will also mean much in the PLCM. There
    are many kinds of wireless access point (AP) that suitable for industrial environment.
    Just as shown in Table 2, different AP has his own advantages and characteristic,
    but all of them will supply big promotion to manufacturing chain. In this paper,
    we depict some obvious advantages in industrial systems compared to traditional
    communication technologies. Table 2. The characteristics of some mainstream wireless
    AP. Manufacturers Characteristic Siemens [51] Supply multi band protocol Logic

    Korenix Jetwave [53] Network self-healing 5.8 GHz communication band High throughput,
    long distance communication Advantech [54] Multiple jump technology Fast roaming
    handover Multiple security mechanisms 3.2.1. Reliability In traditional communication
    links, with line constraints and aging, there are always much problems such as
    communication with terminals and areas where lines cannot reach. However, industrial
    wireless networks (IWN) [55], [56] can fulfill our demand of real-time communication
    while maintaining a robust environment. Furthermore, in some special companies,
    the environment is corrosive and IWN is the only substitute to communicate. 3.2.2.
    Flexibility The IWN requires no cable ties, and the worker can easily configure
    the placement of sensors and meet different demands of smart monitors [57]. Furthermore,
    it also requires a large amount of support to control the machines (especially
    the mobile AGV). 3.2.3. Usability Compared to traditional Ethernet, distributed
    intelligent wireless sensor systems can realize the control of the industrial
    processes independently [58]. The AP can dynamically change depending on the environment
    and machines, and monitor every part of the manufacturing chain. It can help to
    improve the manufacturing chain to realize QoS and low cost. 3.2.4. Security Data
    attacks and information loss are an ever-increasing problem. Security has become
    a big issue and interest is growing everywhere. New forms of encryption will require
    companies to provide more support during the transmission of information and business
    dealings. 3.3. M2M communications In the traditional manufacturing chain, every
    machine was isolated and worked independently. In the time of intelligent manufacturing,
    M2M technologies will integrate these devices and realize cooperative work [59],
    [60]. It can also include limited human intervention. All of the equipment is
    connected to the Internet and is more valuable when it works interdependently
    than individually. Additionally, more and more autonomous and smart services can
    be generated based on the interconnected devices. WSNs are the basic supplements
    of M2M [61], and M2M is the foundation of CPS. With all machines connected to
    the Internet through ICT and WSN, the physical world has been connected to the
    cyber world. However, CPS needs the cyber world and physical world to interact
    with each other, which is an evolution of M2M in intelligent information processing
    [62]. In the development of ICPS, M2M will play a significant role. The development
    of communications will include human-2-human, human-2-machine, and machine-2-machine.
    This is points to the development of a number of application cases that are service-oriented
    and exposed from physical devices, such as sensors, RFIDs, actuators, and machines.
    With the integration of these equipment and terminals, the cyber world and physical
    world can be linked together and generate many kinds of service-oriented applications
    to industries. 3.3.1. M2M area networks M2M area networks aim to furnish connection
    and communication between all kinds of smart machines and sensors and some other
    smart terminals. They can be divided into personal area networks, which include
    IEEE 802.15, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and local networks, which include WIFI, wireless
    M-Bus, and power line communication. According to the range of radiation, transmission
    speed and energy constraints, the area network can supply different services like
    file sharing, video, smart grids, and RFID. 3.3.2. M2M application With the development
    of economy and the improvement of social information level, how to build a ubiquitous
    network society has become a great concern of the government, academia and enterprises
    in many countries. In addition, the increasing number of devices and productions
    including the fast development of social network need rapidly deploy solutions
    that can optimize your business processes and help deliver better and faster services.
    The M2M application is delivered as a cloud-based service to reduce complexity
    and maintenance concerns [63]. It will also take companies robust, proven technology
    based on the highly secure, industry-leading network infrastructure. What’s more,
    the M2M application has built to handle large-scale deployments, high transaction
    rates, and support a large number of concurrent users and reporting assets. In
    industry, the key architecture of smart factories is to realize horizontal integration,
    vertical integration and terminal-to-terminal integration. Industries realize
    the interaction of devices and terminals will improve the efficiency of manufacturing
    chains and monitor and maintain every part of it. In another way, smart enterprises
    need to realize the complete product life cycle management. All parts must coordinate
    and connect with each other to realize flexible and sustainable development, from
    design, materials and processes to logistics, employment and customer service.
    What’s more, every product is a smart terminal. It will know where the user came
    from, and predict where the user will go and what can the user can do. M2M communication
    can supply this to us. ICPS is just the evolution of M2M and achieves the goal
    of sustainable development, green businesses and smart manufacturing. 4. Key challenges
    As a whole, researchers have made some progress in the construction of industrial
    CPS, and the development of cloud technologies has played an important role in
    this system. However, CPS remains in the embryonic stage. A variety of issues
    and challenges need to be further solved at different layers of the architecture
    and from different aspects of system design to ease the integration of the physical
    and cyber worlds. In this chapter, we outline some challenges as follows. 4.1.
    Industrial cloud In industrial environments, information islands are an important
    reason to reduce production efficiency. Mutual equipment cooperation is not smooth,
    information cannot interact, the state cannot be notified in a timely manner,
    and these aspects will restrict the development of enterprises. Industrial clouds
    refer to cloud-computing modes that provide software services to industrial enterprises,
    and social resources can share cloud service platforms which can be easily searched
    by companies. Industrial clouds will greatly reduce the threshold of manufacturing
    information construction. In the process of building smart factories and Industry
    4.0, it will be as the pivotal player to help to realize horizontal integration
    between factories and vertical integration in a manufacturing chain. However,
    the data from different factories and different machines have their own characteristics
    and formats. Developing methods to integrate these data and realize sharing among
    factories is therefore very important. Industrial clouds can extract and integrate
    these data to help industrial organizations to overcome the information gap in
    industrial domains by providing information exchange systems. In this way, it
    will reduce conversion and downtime of equipment and increase the production efficiency.
    In another way, it will also provide an efficient solution to search for business
    partners, industrial processes, components, and technologies, as well as to respond
    to industrial issues to strengthen cooperation between plants, and improve the
    interaction and cooperation between the equipment. For example, in the manufacturing
    chain, we can integrate different pieces of information from different enterprises
    and cooperate with each to finish a product. Moreover, we can monitor the product’s
    entire life cycle and collect the information to supply to customer service. What’s
    more, the industrial cloud will also help to monitor the condition of machines
    all the time and report the information to the maintenance department. It will
    find the problems with equipment in advance, reduce equipment downtime, and improve
    production efficiency. In another way, industrial clouds will provide a big cloud
    platform and generate various services to companies to optimize their office business.
    In this cloud platform, they can achieve internal and external collaborative work,
    message synchronization anytime and anywhere, and realize unlimited imagination
    in the office system. Furthermore, in this platform, these services are free and
    are updated frequently, which will save costs and increase their production efficiency.
    4.2. Data mining Due to the popularity of big data, data mining has developed
    much interest in many domains, such as business intelligence, web searching and
    digital libraries. Data mining involves discovering novel, interesting, and potentially
    useful patterns from large data sets and applying algorithms to the extraction
    of hidden information [64]. It can form many usage applications including risk
    analysis, targeted marketing, customer retention, and portfolio management. The
    objective of any data mining process is to build an efficient predictive or descriptive
    model of a large amount of data that not only best fits or explains it, but is
    also able to generalize to new data [65]. Based on a broad view of data mining
    functionality, data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge
    from large amounts of data stored in either databases [66], data warehouses, or
    other information repositories. Based on the definition of data mining and the
    definition of data mining functions, a typical data mining process includes data
    preparation, data mining and data presentation [67]. In factories, everywhere
    and every time has data generation, the main data resources come from designing,
    manufacturing chains, logistics information, equipment condition monitoring, and
    social network information. Different kinds of data present big challenges to
    process, store, transform and analyze to represent the desired result, which is
    very essential to industries. Moreover, much of these data are semi-structured
    or unstructured, which is different from traditional structured data. All of these
    characteristics determine that we must use different algorithm to analyze them.
    For instance, we must use classification modeling to analyze discrete data while
    we use regression modeling to process continuous data. For another part, with
    numerous data arising from different data sources and in different formats, big
    challenges may arise that will vitally affect our analysis result. In this paper,
    we will focus on the following aspect of data sources, and talk about some of
    their key problems for data mining [68]. Just as we show in Table 3, all of these
    problems will cause distortion of data, which will reduce the value of its analysis.
    Furthermore, data security and privacy have become an essential task for every
    corporation to solve. Data assault and leakage have deeply affected the interests
    of many enterprises. So, data mining will also a big problem in the industry.
    Table 3. The challenges in data mining. Data source Challenges Sensors (e.g. equipment
    condition) Low accuracy, various error Noise affecting the test result Machines
    (e.g. manufacturing chain) Much variable, too much adjust data Unstructured data
    Office system (e.g. logistics transportation) Data record is not accurate Important
    data missing or ignored Cloud service (e.g. social network information) Data security,
    privacy, authority and accuracy 4.3. Real-time processing and reliability Industrial
    wireless networks are essential for industrial systems to realize smart monitoring
    and timely control. In different industrial systems, due to different requirements,
    companies need various qualities of service, which are reliability, energy efficiency,
    low latency and high throughput [69], [70], [71]. These are especially important
    in real-time control systems, which need the data to be transmitted in a timely
    manner. This is similar to mobile automated guided vehicles, which are used to
    transport and load commodities in the manufacturing chain. Sometimes, IWNs must
    cooperate with the machines and production transfer belts to realize seamless
    connection. Thus, the control signal must be transmitted to the components timely
    and accurately. The real-time processing and reliability will also be exhibited
    by remote maintenance capability. In the new process of ICPS, all of machines
    are automated and unmanned. They need to equip self-detection equipment to monitor
    its condition. While some indicators of the machine over the warning line, we
    must adjust it as soon as possible to avoid downtime and mechanical damage. Due
    to less people participate in the manufacturing chain, so all of these sensor,
    actuator and network infrastructure must keep reliability for a long time. Although,
    every AP supplier has its own distinctive advantage, in our survey, we can find
    that all of these advantages are insufficient to realize reliability and real-time
    communication. The most important requirements for reliability and real-time processing
    are latency and packet loss rate, but none of the current systems can achieve
    low delay and loss-free packet transmission. In fact, according to our experience,
    we use some APs to realize wireless roaming to reduce latency to acceptable levels,
    but when we use a computer to connect the AP and communicate with it, the latency
    and packet loss rates increase significantly. However, in manufacturing chains,
    some work steps are needed to achieve perfect synchronization, and this latency
    and data loss can destroy the entire production chain. 4.4. Information security
    and privacy Currently, information security and privacy has grown popular and
    caused more and more interest [72], [73]. Now, we can use cloud tools and other
    resources to search and analyze multimedia files. The final goal of big data is
    to share information for all systems and people. However, increased information
    disclosure and privacy violations have generated concerns [74]. In the time of
    fast development of information, ICT and ICPS aim to integrate everything in the
    big Internet of things system and make them interact with each other. This is
    a big chance to make systems more intelligent and automated, but it is imperative
    for humans to maintain security. 4.4.1. Retention of network security Ethernet
    and wireless networks are the most important information transfer channels in
    the world. In the time of Industry 4.0, it is the foundation technology of ICPS.
    With more and more devices connected to networks, it will cause network congestion
    and the increase of network latency. For another part, if the network is assaulted,
    all of the machines will experience downtime. 4.4.2. Maintaining industrial information
    security In intelligent manufacturing chains, all of the machines are embedded
    into microcomputers and work by themselves through some programs. This will save
    manual work but acquires a threat of information security. If someone invades
    the industrial system and modifies programs to control these machines, it could
    give the factory a devastating blow, similar to the case of the intrusion incident
    of government office systems, which has caused a breach the government can’t handle.
    4.4.3. Maintain data security Recently, most companies have connected to a cloud
    server and deployed its applications. The cloud is a source pool so big that no
    company can control it. Data explosions and attacks have become a big threat to
    many domains. With limited storage space, we can’t store and analyze all of the
    data. Furthermore, most of the rubbish information will cause high latency or
    even destroy our system. Thus, it is inevitable to maintain data security. 5.
    Conclusions In this paper, we addressed the architecture of cloud-assisted industrial
    CPS, and highlighted some key enabling technologies in this process. Then, we
    reviewed some challenges that need to be solved in the future. Cloud-assisted
    CPS is a service-oriented technology. CPS aims to link anything to the Internet,
    but the cloud will provide work after this is achieved. It will be based on cloud
    services and big datasets to realize the integration of devices with devices,
    devices with products, and the cyber world with the physical world. Then, it will
    supply real-time services and PLCM to customers and products. It is an important
    part of smart manufacturing and smart factories. In this process, enabling technologies
    will play an important role in data mining, data analysis and data transformation.
    It will provide support for information and communication to achieve the integration
    of the industrialization and serialization of data. It will always provide support
    for optimizing production efficiency, optimizing production and optimizing service
    quality. However, some challenges will affect the efficiency and quality of services.
    The solution of these problems will play an important role in the future. Then,
    these factories can be directly linked with users to fulfill their real-time demand.
    In the era of Industry 4.0, the use of some enabling technologies to link the
    cyber world and physical world is essential and these key enabling technologies
    supply a big support to the system of ICPS. However, in the future, we also have
    many problems to solve, such as the challenges of security and privacy. Cloud
    computing and big data require many more applications and data sources, but they
    will also encumber us with much rubbish data and data violation. In another way,
    the building of Industry 4.0 is a long way off, some years or even some decades.
    We should follow the direction of the road and develop more technologies to achieve
    it. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science

  explanation: 'The provided text contains a review of 59 research papers on how the
    Internet of Things (IoT) can contribute to circular business models (CBM). The
    research aims to explore the relationship between IoT and CBM, and identify how
    IoT can be used to support the implementation of circular principles within businesses.
    The study considers 4 key IoT capabilities (tracking, monitoring, optimization,
    and design evolution) and 6 CBM categories (Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop,
    Virtualize, and Exchange) proposed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The analysis
    found that IoT can support the implementation and success of CBM, particularly
    the Loop and Optimize models. IoT''s ability to promote joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use in these models.


    The review also highlights that that while IoT can have positive impacts on circular
    economy practices, it also poses a number of obstacles for its application across
    different businesses. These include the lack of standardized data processing methods,
    limited availability and diversity of industrial data, security and privacy concerns,
    and the relatively high investment costs associated with IoT implementation, particularly
    for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the authors recommend
    further research to address these challenges and explore the full potential of
    IoT in enabling circular economy principles across various industries.'
  extract_1: IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’ dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’.
    Papers displaying Loop usually rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while
    optimization and design evolution are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling,
    remanufacturing, and repairing, the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions
    can exploit information for faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption
    products, they can be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri
    et al., 2018). As a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle
    components of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al.,
    2019). In line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate
    environmental criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from
    an IoT-based product life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable
    design and development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and
    Soares, 2017).
  extract_2: Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly related to IoT-enabled
    ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization capabilities,
    as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes and agents
    such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying potential failures,
    and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing products (Venkatesh
    et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally, based on the demands
    of the production and consumption of resources, managers could monitor and Optimize
    production rates and the use of sensors as well as algorithms would enable them
    to automatically intervene in processes to reduce intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi
    and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination
    of cloud computing and machine learning provides potential for complex and integrated
    data-driven process manufacturing models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher
    et al., 2020).

    Abstract In recent years, circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable
    requirement to foster improvements in environmental performance. However, the
    current literature rarely discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT)
    and CBM. This paper first identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring,
    tracking, optimization and design evolution for improving CBM performance based
    on the ReSOLVE framework. In a second step, a systematic literature review using
    the PRISMA approach analyzes how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM
    through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks,
    followed by assessing the quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving
    in CBM. Finally, challenges are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM.
    The results show that the assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate
    current studies. IoT plays a significant role in these business models respectively
    through tracking, monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative)
    case studies for Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed.
    IoT holds the potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced
    applications in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol
    energy consumption, interoperability, security and financial investment might
    become main obstacles for the wider use of IoT in CBM. Previous article in issue

    concepts and a brief history of the IoT Since the birth of the internet in the
    early 1980s, attempts have been made to connect “Things” with the internet. In
    1990, John Romkey created the first Internet ‘device’, a toaster that could be
    turned on and off via the Internet (Romkey, 2017). Paul Saffo gave the first brief
    description of sensors and how they could be used in connection with the internet
    in 1997 (Saffo, 1997). To describe this growing connection of sensors and similar
    devices providing real-time information via the internet, in 1999 the term “Internet
    of Things” was coined by Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization
    and invented a new technology called Radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based
    item identification in the same year (Suresh et al., 2014). In 2003, Walmart deployed
    RFID in all its shops across the globe to measure product stocks and sales and
    support supply chain management (Harold, 2007). In 2005, International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU, 2005) regarded the IoT as a third wave of the world''s information
    industry transformation. In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved
    the usage of the “white space spectrum” (Suresh et al., 2014). Later, IT giants
    like Cisco, IBM and Ericsson took a lot of educational and commercial initiatives
    with IoT. Some countries, like China, listed the IoT as a strategic emerging technology
    in their long-term plans (MIIT, 2012). The IoT technology can be simply explained
    as a connection between humans - computers - things. It uses RFID, infrared sensors,
    global positioning systems, laser scanners and other information-sensing equipment
    to connect any item under internet protocol (IP) with a unique IP address for
    information exchange and communication, which can achieve intelligent positioning,
    tracking, monitoring and management of items. The systems architecture can, for
    instance, be based on the context of operations and processes in real-time scenarios.
    For instance, in a smart home, every electrical switch box could be connected
    with a smart phone so that it could be operated remotely. The HarmonyOS system
    recently created by Huawei uses full stack decoupling architecture that could
    even solve constraints issues on the boundary of software and hardware, thus making
    it possible for other collaborators to join the system (Chen and Matt, 2021).
    Altogether, the application boundary of the IoT has been expanded considerably.
    Such a scenario does not need a processor and a storage device installed in every
    switch box. It just needs a sensor to capture signals and process them (mostly
    switching ON/OFF). 1.2. Potentials by IoT technologies in CE in a finite world
    Avoiding overshooting of planetary boundaries for climate change (Rockström et
    al., 2009) and switching to more sustainable practices are among the greatest
    challenges of the 21st century. Any approach to reduce pressures requires simultaneous
    consideration of economic, social, and especially environmental aspects of industrial
    processes, as well as respective interactions along cradle-to-grave value chains
    of products and services (Ren et al., 2013). Important strategies to reduce critical
    raw material use are sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and circular usage
    of products and materials (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Seuring and Müller
    (2008) defined SSCM as “the management of material, information and capital flows
    as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain, while taking goals
    from all three dimensions – environmental, economic and social into account which
    are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.” Circularity adds a different
    perspective to SSCM as it tries to keep substances in closed loops. Unlike a linear
    economy that is based on a “take-make-dispose” model, CE promotes longevity, reparability,
    durability and recyclability of products with the aim of a full re-use of resources
    (Elisha, 2020). It therefore symbolizes a linear to loop transition for supply
    chains in sustainability (Schröder et al., 2019). In the industry 4.0 (I4.0) era,
    the IoT offers opportunities to foster CE in value chains through real-time monitoring
    of the resources inventory (Mohammadian, 2019). It can support the minimization
    of waste flows through product lifetime detection. As consequence material reuse
    and recycling processes can be optimized. In summary, IoT promotes a highly accurate,
    efficient and sound use of resources aimed at the shift from disposable to renewable
    resources paradigm, and facilitates the born and development of CBM (Ghisellini
    et al., 2016; Nižetić et al., 2020). Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has
    attracted academic researches, which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0
    technologies such as IoT on CBM with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019,
    2020). They discussed CBM and IoT from economic, social and environmental perspectives
    (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed
    how the IoT provides contributions and challenges in the CBM domain. They identified
    important drivers and provided a structured framework that exploring business
    and management-focused CE strategies based on IoT technologies. However, there
    is still a large gap between theory and practice (Gorissen et al., 2016). In particular,
    most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are encountering unprecedented pressure
    to improve environmental performance. Since the adoption cost of the IoT could
    be tremendous, they might hesitate to seize IoT-enabled emission reduction opportunities
    based on their specific status (Ding et al., 2023; Awan et al., 2022a). This requires
    an in-depth understanding of the IoT capabilities and the characteristics of different
    CBMs to find their best intersection point. Besides, the circularity of IoT devices
    themselves should also be considered (Beier et al., 2018). Given these research
    gaps this paper addresses the following research questions. i) What are the (synergy)
    contributions of IoT capabilities under different CBM? ii) What are the carbon
    emission reduction potentials of the IoT in different CBM? iii) What are the obstacles
    for SMEs to adopt IoT in promoting circular strategies? The contributions of this
    paper are as follows: We used a pre-defined circular business framework (ReSOLVE)
    developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2015) to analyze the CBM-IoT context
    and linked it to 6 R principles to specifically map the IoT capabilities into
    each business practices. This visualizes how IoT contributes differently in each
    business model and provides information for us to describe the relationship between
    IoT capabilities, 6 R and CBM. Additionally, we quantitatively review the literature
    on how IoT can contribute to reducing environmental impacts under CBM and identify
    their obstacles. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Prisma
    methodology we used as the method for the literature review, and the reasoning
    of paper selection. Section 3 reviews IoT''s role in CE, introduces the capabilities
    of IoT correlated with CBM and identifies its environmental opportunities. Section
    4 reflects on potential obstacles for IoT adjustment in CBM. Section 5 comprehensively
    summarizes our findings and concludes. Finally, section 6 outlines limitations
    and gives recommendations for future research. 2. Review approach: Prisma 2.1.
    Introduction of Prisma In June 2022, we conducted a literature search based on
    the checklist framework provided by the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015).
    PRISMA was initially used in the medical field. Although other methods for conducting
    literature reviews and meta-analyses are available (Horvathova, 2012; Luederitz
    et al., 2016), PRISMA guidelines have become widely accepted as an approach to
    conduct transparent literature reviews. Recently they have been applied in the
    field of sustainability and CE research (Blanco et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019;
    Zalk and Behrens, 2018; Aguilar-Hernandez et al., 2021). The latest PRISMA Abstract
    2020 (Page et al., 2021a, Page et al., 2021b) suggests discussing 5 main items
    in relation to 10 subcategories in a review. We refer to the checklist items listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Major steps in Prisma Abstract 2020 (Page et al., 2021a,
    Page et al., 2021b). Section and Topic Item # Checklist item TITLE Title 1 Identify
    the report as a systematic review. BACKGROUND Objectives 2 Provide an explicit
    statement of the main objectives or questions. METHODS Eligibility criteria 3
    Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. Information sources
    4 Specify the information sources (e.g., databases, search terms) used to identify
    studies. Risk of bias 5 Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the
    studies included. Synthesis of results 6 Specify the methods used to present and
    synthesize results. RESULTS Included studies 7 Give the total number of studies
    included and participants and summarize relevant characteristics of the studies.
    Synthesis of results 8 Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating
    the number of studies included and participants for each. If a meta-analysis was
    carried out, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If
    comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (i.e., which group is favoured).
    DISCUSSION Limitations of evidence 9 Provide a brief summary of the limitations
    of the evidence included in the review (e.g., study risk of bias, inconsistency
    and imprecision). Interpretation 10 Provide a general interpretation of the results
    and important implications. These categories explain the search objectives and
    eligibility criteria, including the methods and reasons for including and excluding
    certain records (i.e. some papers do not contain the keywords checked for but
    have keywords with similar meanings, some papers contain the keywords but do not
    explain them in detail). Second, it describes the steps of the quantitative analysis,
    which includes collecting data from selected publications and harmonizing their
    values. Based on this framework, this literature review was conducted. 2.2. Classification
    of papers We use the 6 R concept (Joshi et al., 2006) to initially classify circularity
    strategies and related business models, as shown in Fig. 1. The 6 R concept discerns
    Reuse, Recycle, Reduce, Repair, Remanufacture and Redesign. Sihvonen and Ritola
    (2015) regarded the 6 R framework as the operational approaches and core principles
    of CE. Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2013) pointed out that discovering
    new paths to support CE under 6 R guidance – “an industrial system that is restorative
    or regenerative by intention and design” is becoming more and more vital against
    the background of Industrial 4.0 era. From a systems perspective, the combination
    of six operational approaches (6 R) enables new business models of CE at the macro
    level (Kirchherr et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download

    Based on these characteristics, the ReSOLVE framework further explains CE -- Preserve
    and enhance natural capital, optimize resource yields and foster system effectiveness,
    and classifies circular models based on the economic and resource impacts of major
    sectors (EMF, 2015). It offers a tool for generating circular strategies and growth
    initiatives. Jabbour et al. (2018) then connected Industry 4.0 technologies to
    six CBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, namely Regenerating, Share, Optimize,
    Loop, Virtualize and Exchange, to guide organizations through implementing the
    principles of the CE (EMF, 2015), as shown in Table 2. Most technologies own opportunities
    in specific areas, while the IoT can play a significant role to make such business
    models viable (Jabbour et al., 2018). Table 2. Explanation of six business models
    in ReSOLVE framework. Business models Explanation Regenerate This business model
    is based on a shift to renewable energy and materials. Biological cycles are used
    to enable the circulation of energy and materials, and to convert organic waste
    into sources of energy and raw material for other chains. Share Assets are shared
    between individuals (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public
    sharing of a pool of products). As a consequence, products should be designed
    to last longer by the producers, and maintenance should be available to allow
    the re-use and extension of product life. Optimize This business model requires
    organizations to use digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation,
    and big data to reduce waste in production systems across supply chains. As a
    result, organizations will benefit from increased performance. Loop This business
    model aims to promote the circularity of raw materials and energy. The design,
    production, and supply chain therefore have to be adjusted from the perspective
    of the entire life cycle. Virtualize This business model is service-focused which
    replaces physical with virtual and dematerialized products. Exchange It involves
    substituting old and non-renewable goods for advanced and renewable ones. While
    the exact terminology to describe IoT-related capabilities varies under different
    scenarios, we synthesized core capabilities of the technology as found in literature.
    Ingemarsdotter et al. (2019) suggests that IoT''s can support the development
    of circular business models via capabilities such as tracking, monitoring, control,
    optimization and design evolution, and stated that optimization often relies on
    the use of control capability. Therefore, we incorporated the control capability
    into optimization to reduce the list of relevant IoT capabilities to four, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. IoT capabilities that can support implementation of
    the ReSOLVE framework. IoT capabilities Definition of functions Tracking Available
    information for products'' identity, location, or unique composition. Monitoring
    Available information for products'' real-time condition, or environment. This
    includes alerts and notifications. Optimization Goal-based improvements of operations
    are controlled and optimized by using advanced algorithms. Design Evolution The
    design of a product can be upgraded based on data feedback from other lifecycle
    phases. This includes functional or routing upgrades. 2.2.1. Selection of papers
    On the basis of the discussion above, in order to systematically review the contribution
    of the IoT to circular economy business models, we used the following terms as
    a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation -- Title, Abstract, Keyword
    = [“internet of things” AND (“circular economy” OR “circular business model” OR
    “sustainable supply chain”)]. In total, there were 432 papers available on Scopus
    and 142 papers available on Web of Science (WoS). We excluded duplicate records
    and papers that have no relation to any elements of the 6 R through browsing abstracts.
    Then, we further excluded papers with non-CBM descriptions discerned in the RESOLVE
    framework after browsing the full texts. In this way, 59 papers were retained
    to explore the contribution of the IoT to CBM, see Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of
    selected publications in the review (status in June 2022). Then, a quantitative
    analysis of how the IoT reduces environmental impacts in CBM was conducted. For
    this, from the included papers we acquired 23 results that a) quantified impacts
    on energy-related indicators in circular economy (e.g., energy use or CO2 emissions)
    and b) compared these impacts before and after using IoT technology. 3. Review:
    impacts of the IoT on CBM 3.1. Descriptive results The retrieved 59 papers used
    for describing the contribution of the IoT to CBM can be categorized by journal,
    year of publication, and sector/application. Fig. 3 shows the number of articles
    published in different journals under the given search term and constraints. The
    number of papers published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability
    and Computers in Industry appears to dominate. These journals make up 25.5% of
    the total share, which is much higher than that of other journals. The core fields
    covered by these journals include computer science, engineering and environmental
    science. The number of papers has increased significantly over time. Publications
    in the last 3 years occupy exceed 2/3 of the total share, which indicates a growing
    interest on this topic. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Numbers of IoT publications in different types of journals.
    Next, we use the framework developed by Maroli et al. (2021) to classify 59 papers
    into 4 major categories: reviews, theory studies, new designs and case studies.
    Reviews include pure review articles that classify and summarize previous studies.
    Theory studies generally analyze and discuss the proposed new framework for specific
    issues mainly based on surveying experts (Delphi) or questionnaires. New designs
    imply the development of a new mathematical model or a new protocol design for
    an IoT solution but without a real case to verify factual feasibility. Case studies
    further calculate or simulate the case and obtain reference results based on real
    or defined cases compared with the new design. A brief supplementary description
    of each article is also attached to this table to provide an overview of each
    research division. These classified papers are then categorized into six business
    models suggested by ReSOLVE framework (EMF, 2015). As shown in Fig. 4. Download

    Division of publications into the 6 ReSOLVE categories of CE business models.
    Over 60% of the papers describe the contribution of IoT to Loop and Optimize models.
    Both of these two models have higher potential impacts on manufacturing, transportation
    and storage, and IoT could thus promote significant business transformation within
    these sectors (EMF, 2015). As for Optimize, IoT helps to realize smart manufacturing
    and SSCM through improving decision-making plans to reduce the consumption of
    energy and resources. Most of the theoretical studies here explored and developed
    frameworks for low carbon footprints in different industries based on IoT capabilities
    of collecting, processing information more efficiently (Gružauskas et al., 2018;
    Chit et al., 2021; Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Jagtap et al., 2021). The limited
    number of cases and new designs are usually process optimizations in enterprises,
    where IoT is used to develop intelligent production scheduling and logistics delivery
    models to promote green and sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing
    (Liao and Wang, 2019). In the Loop business model, most studies focused on waste
    management. Here, IoT is mainly used to realize waste collection optimization
    and more accuracy of decision support system for end-life products recycling (Bányai
    et al., 2019; Velvizhi et al., 2020; Al-Masri et al., 2018). Some theoretical
    studies designed CE–IoT-enabled ecosystems based on key enabling IoT technologies
    (Miaoudakis et al., 2020). Others combined it with LCA model to aid their processes
    of designing new products with low environmental impact (Zhang et al., 2020; de
    Oliveira and Soares, 2017). New designs and case studies validated IoT-enabled
    solutions based on products with different technical route characteristics, such
    as plastic waste and scrapped cars (Plakas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018), etc.
    Though the proportion of case studies is relatively low, only 11%. The remaining
    four business models account for only a small part of the articles. Among them,
    the sharing model generally relies on online platforms or apps supported by IoT,
    which brings the channel for products or information sharing between different
    stakeholders (Mastos et al., 2020). Virtualize and Exchange models usually demands
    extra technologies such as virtual world tools, digital twin (DT) and 3D printers
    to realize (Gustafson-Pearce and Grant, 2017; Despeisse et al., 2017; Rocca et
    al., 2020). 3.2. Connection of ReSOLVE framework with 6 R and IoT capabilities
    We further classified the papers in a number of matrices, considering the 6 R,
    IoT capabilities and Circular Business Model (CBM) categories discussed in section
    2. This results in a ‘heat map’ of the occurrences of CBM-IoT and CBM-6R cross-sections
    within the sample of 59 papers, see Fig. 5. Many papers describe multiple CBM-IoT
    and CBM-6R cross-sections. It should further be noted that while the categories
    are uniquely defined, they are not mutually exclusive. Below, we explored patterns
    for each of the CBM. 1. Loop business model Download : Download high-res image
    (399KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Heat map of the CBM-6R and
    CBM-IoT cross-section occurrences. The findings show that IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’
    dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’. Papers displaying Loop usually
    rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while optimization and design evolution
    are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling, remanufacturing, and repairing,
    the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions can exploit information for
    faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption products, they can
    be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri et al., 2018). As
    a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle components
    of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al., 2019). In
    line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate environmental
    criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from an IoT-based product
    life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable design and
    development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and Soares, 2017).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 4. 2. Optimize business model Table 4. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Loop model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking A research project called POIROT, which exploits IoT technologies,
    aiming to realize a platform for the traceability of organic waste and transform
    it into inert, odorless and sanitized material (De Fazio et al., 2019). Monitoring
    An IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model that addresses the uncertainty
    of a product''s residual value based on the life cycle monitored from the IoT
    sensors (Mboli et al., 2020). Optimization A system that combines intelligent
    transportation systems (RFIDs, sensors, cameras, actuators and surveillance systems)
    and an advanced decision system (incorporating data sharing between truck drivers
    in real time to perform dynamic route optimization) for efficient waste collection
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly
    related to IoT-enabled ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization
    capabilities, as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes
    and agents such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying
    potential failures, and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing
    products (Venkatesh et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally,
    based on the demands of the production and consumption of resources, managers
    could monitor and Optimize production rates and the use of sensors as well as
    algorithms would enable them to automatically intervene in processes to reduce
    intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et
    al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination of cloud computing and machine learning
    provides potential for complex and integrated data-driven process manufacturing
    models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher et al., 2020). Typical cases
    are listed in Table 5. 3. Share business model Table 5. Illustration of the use
    of IoT capabilities in the Optimize model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Tracking RFID technology to tag and track fresh milk could reduce the amount of
    product shrinkage (Bottani et al., 2014). Monitoring Based on IoT sensors, energy
    and cost savings will be achieved as long as the state of the ideal ball mill
    is specifically analyzed and extended to the other ball mills. (Ma et al., 2020).
    Optimization Each node (including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers) could
    be involved in managing and optimizing its own performance in terms of production,
    deliveries and environmental compliance by using RFID tags and wireless sensor
    networks (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Hasanova and Romanovs, 2020). Monitoring and
    tracking are main capabilities of IoT that contribute to sharing business model,
    they help in the product ‘Resign’ and ‘Recycle’ in order to achieve product lifetime
    extension, as shown in Appendix figure A2. Information on consumers'' behavior
    is collected through websites and apps, organizations can therefore both improve
    product design and provide a digital service for better utilization or replacement
    of equipment, and increase customer satisfaction (Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Ingemarsdotter
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the use of sensors in products allows performance monitoring
    - for instance, monitoring maintenance requirements - thereby allowing organizations
    to proactively provide a high quality of service to customers. As a consequence
    of monitoring products during consumer use, organizations can invest in extending
    product life spans by applying the 3Rs strategy (repair, reuse, and recycle).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 6. 4. Virtualize business model Table 6. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Share model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking Cranfield University launched a shoe recycling project: it includes
    the design of an intelligent component (IoT) that tracks the condition of the
    shoes and identifies the need for replacement/upgrading. The modular design of
    the shoes allows them to be easily disassembled for refurbishing or recycling
    (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Monitoring A cross-company IoT communication protocol
    has the potential to offer an automated negotiation ecosystem between scrap metal
    producers and waste collecting companies based on cost, demand etc. (Mastos et
    al., 2020). Optimization IoT helps to achieve a mutual visible inventory under
    business-to-business e-commerce models in real time, where average food inventory,
    amount of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share and ordering from the
    main depot; customer service level in the network is optimized (Ekren et al.,
    2021). Since service is a core focus of Virtualize, using real-time data to monitor
    supply activities is important to enhance the customer experience. It also triggers
    the potential of IoT-enabled “Redesign” of the product or service with the help
    of design evolution capability. Through virtually designing, simulating, and optimizing
    the system and converting it on the real world, it is possible to achieve system
    reconfigurability through a change of both specific hardware (i.e., change of
    robot tools for disassembly activities), and software resources (i.e., robot program
    coding) (Sassanelli et al., 2021). The IoT enables connections between organizations,
    suppliers, and customers in order to offer services rather than physical products
    (Jabbour et al., 2018). In addition, the IoT is able to collect information on
    consumers’ behavior and features of past designs, which designers can use to improve
    service quality. Typical cases are listed in Table 7. 5. Exchange business model
    Table 7. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Virtualize model.
    IoT capabilities Representative examples Monitoring Gustafson-Pearce and Grant
    (2017) tested 3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of ‘streamed’ data
    generated by IoT, to discover whether knowledge sharing and learning within a
    horizontal supply chain was effective and reduced greenhouse gas emissions related
    to business travel. Design evolution A platform that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain
    to provide interactive innovation in prefabricated housing construction among
    shareholders, who were involved in life-cycle value co-design via online channels
    (e.g., mobile apps) (Li et al., 2021). A platform installing IoT devices in a
    smart building to measure energy consumption and provide energy optimization consulting
    services for end-users and building managers (Sharma et al., 2021). IoT could
    provide a scenario of experience shopping from a mirror image, aiming to solve
    the distortion of consumer''s experience in traditional online shopping (Gao and
    Han, 2021). IoT integrates the manufacturing execution system (MES) to the DT
    by using a communication protocol, which is able to give commands to the MES from
    external sources and digitalize the CE practices (Rocca et al., 2020). This model
    could acquire strength by adopting additive manufacturing and IoT systems with
    monitoring capability (Despeisse et al., 2017). 3D printers are able to process
    renewable and sustainable production. Based on interaction between organizations
    and customers, some companies are able to manufacture customized products by using
    databases incorporating 3D printers, where IoT helps to save time and material
    use in additive manufacturing. These kinds of functions make IoT easier to achieve
    CE principles. Typical cases are listed in Table 8. 6. Regenerate business model
    Table 8. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Exchange model. IoT
    capabilities Representative examples Monitoring The additive manufacturing leads
    to reduced use of material, IoT-enabled 3D printers enable the recycling of small
    quantities of waste (Despeisse et al., 2017). Optimization IoTs are used for the
    identification of engineered disassemblers as well as the real-time status of
    reproducible resources to build efficient multi-target production planning in
    real-time by the seed swarm optimization algorithm (Chau et al., 2021). The model
    could benefit from IoT in the form of sensors and networks. The design, production
    and supply decisions of CE could be adjusted based on data provided by IoT (EMF,
    2016). This would make it possible to reduce unnecessary resource consumption
    to improve the productivity of harvests, and to extend the life cycle of the land
    use. Typical cases are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Illustration of the use of
    IoT capabilities in the Regenerate model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Monitoring To monitor, and control factors related to land management between
    crop rotation, to automate irrigation systems based on weather conditions in real
    time, and to manage the use of pesticides according to the health of plantations
    (EMF Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Optimization IoT allows real-time
    measurement of ceramic tile production, providing the capability to modify the
    composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize the use of
    local raw materials, reducing the distances between mines and the factory and
    by favoring rail transport (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). In all, the concept of
    6 R is gradually supported by IoT technology. It promotes the combination of 6
    R in different circular business practices (Kirchherr et al., 2017; Spaltini et
    al., 2021), and each business model represents a major circularity opportunity
    enabled by the IoT technology that is quite different from growth in the linear
    economy. Therefore, we selected main contributors of 6 R and CBM from the ‘heat
    map’ results, and then constructed a relationship framework that containing the
    conceptualization of 4 IoT capabilities, 6 R and ReSOLVE framework, as shown in
    Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Relationship framework for IoT enabled 6 R and CBM. As for IoT capabilities,
    the monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular business
    models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization capability.
    And for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle and Redesign are the core
    CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular strategies.
    In different ways, these actions all increase the utilization of physical assets,
    prolong their life, and shift resource use from finite to renewable sources. They
    potentially reinforce and accelerate the performance of the other actions, creating
    a compounding effect. 3.3. Quantitative analysis of how the use of IoT in CBMs
    reduces energy-related environmental impacts Within the collected papers, 20 papers
    provide quantitative data on how the use of IoT in CBMs can reduce environmental
    impacts. These papers provide 23 cases. We included them in our quantitative analysis
    for they mainly use energy savings as the primary measurement. Fig. 7 depicts
    how much energy is saved by using IoT in the six ReSOLVE business model categories
    (Virtualize is missing due to lack of data). The X-axis shows the ReSOLVE business
    model categories and their number of samples in each. The Y-axis represents the
    relative energy savings compared to a baseline scenario without IoT enhancement
    (i.e., the energy use in the baseline is set on 100%). Supplementary Table 2 contains
    a list of cases and their references. 1. Optimize business model Download : Download

    saving under different IoT-enabled CBM (CI = 95%). Most results show quantitative
    data from the Optimize business model (11 results). Here, big data of related
    resource objects is collected using IoT sensors. The resource allocation framework
    is then optimized using heuristic algorithms for specific consumption habits to
    prevent any unwanted negative environmental impact in scheduling issues (Liao
    and Wang, 2019). 2. Loop business model 6 results consider the Loop business model.
    IoT solutions enable the transition to a cyber-physical1 waste management system,
    and provide real-time information on waste generation, treatment, transportation,
    and material handling capacity in big random systems. Carbon emissions from collected
    and transported waste have been significantly reduced due to enhanced recycling
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). 3. Share business model 4 results discuss the Share business
    model, where IoT lowers energy and resource waste in corporate processes by sharing
    information, products or services (Ekren et al., 2021). For instance, IoT facilitates
    the recording of food expiration dates and facilitates communal food sharing (Phiri
    and Trevorrow, 2019). 4. Regenerate and Exchange business model The Regenerate
    and Exchange models each have a single case. In Regenerate model, IoT is utilized
    for the identification of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of
    regenerable resources in order to construct effective multi-target production
    planning (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). While in Exchange model, IoT assists in
    modifying the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize
    the utilization of local raw materials (Chau et al., 2021). The effects of relative
    energy savings in the Optimize and Loop business models are evident and comparable,
    with corresponding mean value of 30% and 25%. It may be attributed to the parallels
    of the two models in leveraging IoT capabilities. With the difference that Optimize
    model utilizes more on the optimization capabilities, which may provide it with
    higher energy saving potential. Some measures in the Optimize model could even
    achieve energy savings of up to 70%. But the effect of the Share business model
    is highly variable, ranging from less than 20%–80%, with the majority of results
    falling closer to the lower end. The results of the remaining three models are
    limited. Nevertheless, they present oppotunities for further investigation. 4.
    Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the use of IoT in CBMs While reviewing
    the literature, as described above we found many ways of how IoT could support
    the implementation of circular CBMs. However, some of these references also highlighted
    environmental risks of IoT, or other obstacles to implementing and using IoT.
    These findings including related references are discussed below, and Table 10
    summarizes them. Table 10. Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the
    implementation of IoT. Type Drawbacks and obstacles Environmental Use of harmful
    substances and non-degradable resources Hardware power consumption IoT node software
    energy consumption IoT protocol energy efficiency Other Lack of standardization
    and technological knowledge among partners Data availability High financial investment
    Security of virtual platform Inadequate internet connectivity 4.1. Environmental
    drawbacks One of the drawbacks of IoT-enabled business models includes the energy
    use of IoT and related carbon emissions, such as IoT hardware, node software and
    protocol energy consumption (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2021). Hardware is the basis
    for the IoT network, and both hardware and software needs to be optimized together
    to re duce environmental burdens. Such optimizations are particularly important
    for certain digital signal processing tasks, including compression, feature extraction,
    or machine learning training. The IoT is also dependent on protocols that enable
    communicating between the various nodes and routing devices involved in an IoT
    network. In terms of software implementation, these protocols must be energy-efficient
    and should minimize the use of communication interfaces. Next to this, IoT equipment
    may result in difficult to process electronic waste. An example consists of RFID
    tags that are hazardous to the environment and are difficult to recycle (Yu et
    al., 2022). Another concern is that IoT enables mass customization. Customization
    makes it more difficult for another user to reuse or recycle an item (Birkel et
    al., 2019). A key observation is that many studies do not take into account such
    environmental drawbacks of implementing IoT technology (i.e., the impact of producing
    or using IoT devices, etc.). Some preliminary analyses have been presented in
    the literature. For instance, Mataloto et al. (2019) discovered that IoT devices
    (LoRa) for energy management systems require an annual energy usage of 5.2 kWh
    if applied in small buildings (16–40 m2). Bottani et al. (2014) assessed the environmental
    performance and burdens of the use of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain based
    on life cycle assessment (LCA) and found that the environmental costs of 1 million
    RFID tags are 32,900 kg CO2-eq in climate change potential, 23.9 kg P-eq in freshwater
    eutrophication, and 156 molc H + -eq in acidification potential. Comparatively
    to the existing studies, there is a dearth of papers that examine the positive
    and negative contributions of IoT to CBM via case studies or simulations. This
    involves not only a full examination of its production, transportation, disposal,
    and reuse synergies, but also an evaluation of the LCA of IoT components. 4.2.
    Other obstacles Next to environmental drawbacks the literature we reviewed gave
    some more general implementation obstacles with regard to the use of IoT in CBMs.
    Firstly, there is often a lack of structured data management processes to ensure
    the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial analysis (Ingemarsdotter et
    al., 2020). Due to the limited availability and variety of industrial data, evaluating
    and validating representative models of real-world systems can be difficult, i.e.,
    determining when sufficient data has been acquired to ensure the representativeness
    of a simulation framework. (Fisher et al., 2020). Secondly, the absence of standardization
    and guidance in implementing IoT across various businesses poses a concern. There
    can be a lack of regulations addressing data ownership among stakeholders (Astill
    et al., 2019). The wide implementation of CE strategies is contingent upon solving
    such data ownership issues. Thirdly, ensuring privacy and data security poses
    a challenge (Roy and Roy, 2019). End-users as intermediate nodes in the manufacturing
    and remanufacturing cycle and vulnerable firewall nodes can be susceptible to
    botnet assaults (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). One typical case is the IoT botnet
    Mirai, a malware that could target consumer electronics and home routers, turning
    them into a zombie remotely controlled bots that can be used in large-scale network
    attacks (Antonakakis et al., 2017). Such challenges may be solved by IoT projects
    funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research program, it includes the
    European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, as well as public-private partnerships
    such as the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data and Robotics (Calisti,
    2020). These projects are expected to use distributed AI, address security, privacy
    and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralized topologies and
    governance. In addition, it is challenging to rapidly design IoT-enabled products
    for interoperability, adaptability, and upgradability (Ingemarsdotter et al.,
    2020). Currently, potential solutions tend to point at blockchain technology.
    However, integrating blockchain within the IoT framework will also pose technical,
    infrastructure, energy consumption, interoperability and social regulatory issues
    (Feng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020). The last impediment
    are the limited resources small-scale enterprises can invest systematically in
    IoT technologies throughout their entire supply chains (Tan et al., 2020). 5.
    Conclusion and outlook This review has assessed the state-of-the-art relation
    of IoT and CBM from several perspectives. Based on the Prisma approach, this article
    reviews the literature on the IoT and CBMs that has been expanding significantly
    in recent years. Through the classification of their methods and contents, this
    paper constructed a mapping framework connecting the ReSOLVE concept with four
    IoT capabilities and the 6 R framework. It depicts the current research status
    of IoT supported CBMs and explains their contribution for enterprises from the
    perspective of 6 R with representative cases. IoT by its support of joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use. These characteristics of IoT support the implementation
    and success of CBMs, particularly the Loop and Optimize CBMs. These conclusions
    are similar to those of previously published studies. However, the dynamic feedback
    potential of the IoT also proves to be vital for the “Redesign” of product or
    service concepts, especially for Virtualize, Share and Exchange models which have
    not been fully explored before. Therefore, we revealed potential directions based
    on these preliminary studies: For instance, in the Share approach, IoT helps to
    provide a sharing platform that enables consumers to share products, essentially
    providing the same amount of final services with a smaller product pool. The IoT
    also provides virtual and dematerialized options as service solutions rather than
    physical products with similar functions to achieve design evolution capability,
    supporting the “Redesign” CE strategy through the combination of other I4.0 technologies
    such as DT. The review of quantitative assessments suggests that IoT has the potential
    to reduce the energy consumption of the Optimize and Loop business model by about
    20–30%. By redesigning and integrating IoT and IoT-based algorithms into business
    operations, the energy efficiency of the system can be greatly increased. In addition,
    IoT can help to minimize waste generation and enhance efficiency of resource use.
    However, the widespread usage of IoT and related data processing activities in
    itself can lead to higher energy use and generation of e-waste, which often is
    difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of obstacles for its cross-business
    applications, including the difficulties of establishing universal standards for
    data processing, cybersecurity liability issues, and relatively high investment
    costs. These assessments of strengths and challenges of IoT can provide more intuitive
    information for SMEs investors who are interested in innovative technologies and
    circular development. 6. Limitations and recommendations This research has limitations
    as well. Firstly, given the fact that the research on the interaction between
    the IoT and CE is still in its infancy, most of the references discuss conceptual
    frameworks, models and theoretical evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most
    case studies only explore one or a few technical applications of IoT, these limits
    the value of meta-analyses as attempted in this paper. Particularly for the Virtualize,
    Exchange and Regenerate CBMs the number of available cases was low. We hence recommend
    a more systematic, quantitative analysis of case studies on how IoT can contribute
    to CBMs and environmental improvements. Secondly, the literature gives just limited
    information on the environmental drawbacks of IoT. Some studies on e.g., RFID
    suggest that their production and use generate just limited environmental damage
    (Jia et al., 2012). However, to analyze the environmental benefits and drawbacks
    of IoT comprehensively, further research is needed that should consider specific
    IoT application scenarios, material choices and future improvement potentials
    that may be available due to scale and learning effects. These could become the
    focal points of the future phase of IoT research. Declaration of competing interest

  explanation: 'Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are a promising enabling
    technology for 6G wireless networks, as they can be used to improve coverage and
    capacity, reduce interference, and enhance security. However, RIS also has some
    challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize its potential.


    One challenge with RIS is the need for accurate channel estimation. In order to
    effectively reflect signals, RIS needs to know the channel conditions between
    itself and the transmitter and receiver. This can be difficult to estimate in
    practice, especially in dynamic environments. Another challenge with RIS is the
    need for low-power operation. RIS devices are typically small and battery-powered,
    so they need to be able to operate with minimal power consumption. This can be
    difficult to achieve, especially when RIS is used to reflect high-power signals.


    Finally, RIS is still a relatively new technology, and there are some challenges
    associated with its deployment and operation. For example, RIS devices need to
    be carefully placed and configured in order to achieve the desired performance.
    Additionally, RIS can be susceptible to interference from other wireless devices,
    which can degrade its performance.'

    Abstract: The 5G wireless communication network is currently faced with the challenge\
    \ of limited\ndata speed exacerbated by the proliferation of billions of data-intensive\
    \ applications. To address\nthis problem, researchers are developing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies for the envisioned 6G wireless\ncommunication standards to satisfy\
    \ the escalating wireless services demands. Though some of\nthe candidate technologies\
    \ in the 5G standards will apply to 6G wireless networks, key disruptive\ntechnologies\
    \ that will guarantee the desired quality of physical experience to achieve ubiquitous\n\
    wireless connectivity are expected in 6G. This article ﬁrst provides a foundational\
    \ background on the\nevolution of different wireless communication standards to\
    \ have a proper insight into the vision and\nrequirements of 6G. Second, we provide\
    \ a panoramic view of the enabling technologies proposed to\nfacilitate 6G and\
    \ introduce emerging 6G applications such as multi-sensory–extended reality, digital\n\
    replica, and more. Next, the technology-driven challenges, social, psychological,\
    \ health and com-\nmercialization issues posed to actualizing 6G, and the probable\
    \ solutions to tackle these challenges\nare discussed extensively. Additionally,\
    \ we present new use cases of the 6G technology in agricul-\nture, education,\
    \ media and entertainment, logistics and transportation, and tourism. Furthermore,\n\
    we discuss the multi-faceted communication capabilities of 6G that will contribute\
    \ signiﬁcantly to\nglobal sustainability and how 6G will bring about a dramatic\
    \ change in the business arena. Finally,\nwe highlight the research trends, open\
    \ research issues, and key take-away lessons for future research\nexploration\
    \ in 6G wireless communication.\nKeywords: 6G wireless communication; 6G vision;\
    \ 6G requirements; 6G enabling technologies;\n6G challenges; 6G applications;\
    \ 6G use cases; 6G infrastructure; 6G sustainability; 6G business model\n1. Introduction\n\
    The commercialization of 5G commenced in 2019, and further adoption is expected\n\
    in 2021 and beyond. There have been tangential research interest on future 6G\
    \ wireless\nnetworks [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic forced more businesses online,\
    \ birthing a “New\nNormal” with a borderless workplace. Ericsson has forecasted\
    \ that there will be faster\ncommercialization of 5G as more people embrace this\
    \ shift to a borderless workplace. The\nresulting surge in Internet usage beams\
    \ light on the need for better connectivity to meet the\ngrowing demand for more\
    \ stringent network requirements. This is required to facilitate\nemerging technologies\
    \ such as extended reality [2], haptics [3], connected autonomous\nsystems [4],\
    \ telemedicine, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [5], which are sensitive\
    \ to\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21051709\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 1709\n2 of 58\nlatency and require ultra-fast data speed. For\
    \ example, ultra-low latency and ultra-fast data\nspeed reduce the collision rates\
    \ and improve the safety of the autonomous vehicle. These\napplications are necessary\
    \ to facilitate autonomous and smart life, multisensory virtual\nexperience, intelligent\
    \ cities, smart agriculture, and more. Unfortunately, the promising\n5G networks\
    \ cannot meet these growing demands [6,7]. Thus, there is an imperative\nneed\
    \ for the development of 6G communication networks. 6G wireless networks are\n\
    also proposed to ameliorate social needs, thereby facilitating the actualization\
    \ of the\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [8]. The proposed network requirements\
    \ of 6G\ncan be summarized as (1) Ultra-fast data rates as high as 1Tbps (2) Ultra-low\
    \ latency of\nless than 1ms (3) Increased mobility and coverage (4) Flexible,\
    \ and efﬁcient connection\nof trillion level objects [9] (5) Peak spectral efﬁciency\
    \ of 60 b/s/Hz (6) Very high system\nreliability (7) Improved network security.\n\
    6G is expected to have data-rates in the order of terabits per second and a latency\n\
    of less than 1ms. It is expected to drive the Internet of Everything, with 107\
    \ connections\nper km2 [10]. To achieve this, 6G will leverage on subterahertz\
    \ and Terahertz spectrum\n(300 GHz to 10 THz) [11,12], which provides a higher\
    \ frequency spectrum as against the\nmillimeter wave spectrum (30–300 GHz) adopted\
    \ in 5G [13]. Exploring a higher frequency\nspectrum is necessary because the\
    \ sub-6GHz range is already crowded. Apart from giving\nroom for more spectrum,\
    \ the Terahertz spectrum gives rise to higher data rates desirable in\n6G networks.\
    \ However, transmitting at a higher frequency spectrum is prone to high path\n\
    loss, making the distance for transmission limited. This and other challenges\
    \ with THz\ntransmissions, such as hardware constraints, are treated in this paper.\
    \ Additionally, Optical\nwireless technologies [14] such as Visible Light Communication\
    \ (VLC) [15] and Free Space\nOptical communication [16] are discussed extensively.\n\
    Additionally, technologies such as Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) [17–19],\n\
    cell-free massive MIMO [20], Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), which are expected to\
    \ drive the\nactualization of 6G, are broached. We consider RIS, which will be\
    \ deployed on doors, win-\ndows of buildings to reﬂect received signal without\
    \ interference. Furthermore, we explore\nwhy the RIS technology is a preferable\
    \ candidate to the existing relays. The massive MIMO\ntechnology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with a more dense network of access points (APs) [21]. This\nis further\
    \ developed in 6G to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [22]. The beneﬁts\n\
    are tremendous as it improves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks. However,\n\
    there are challenges with obtaining channel information and concerns about health\
    \ risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs. There is limited literature\
    \ to address these\nconcerns; thus, the need for this review. We also believe\
    \ Pervasive AI is critical in actualiz-\ning 6G. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks [23,24],\
    \ Deep Neural Networks [25] have been proposed\nto enable intelligent networks.\n\
    Despite the auspicious view of this technology, challenges with complex data and\
    \ more\nhave been highlighted. These challenges have been delineated in this article.\
    \ Other enabling\ntechnologies such as Quantum Communication [26], Ambient Backscatter\
    \ Communication\nSystems (ABCS) [27], Blockchain [28], UAVs [29], and more have\
    \ also been proposed and\ntreated extensively in this paper. Future generation\
    \ networks are desired to have high speed\nand low latency and secured communication.\
    \ Quantum communication has been proposed\nto enable security and facilitate faster\
    \ processing power for future wireless networks [30].\nHowever, there are doubts\
    \ if research in quantum communication will be ripe enough\nto facilitate the\
    \ 6G communication systems [31]. However, this technology will see more\nlight\
    \ in the beyond 6G, towards the 7G era. Blockchain is another technology proposed\n\
    to facilitate security, and we have examined this with the hope that it would\
    \ provide the\ndesired privacy and integrity in future wireless networks. Blockchain\
    \ technology has been\nintroduced in 5G [32], and further research on the challenges\
    \ treated in Section 5 of this\npaper would facilitate the security of future\
    \ wireless networks.\nEnergy efﬁciency is another interesting topic for future\
    \ wireless networks. It is desir-\nable to have hardware that is compatible with\
    \ the energy requirements of 6G. Ambient\nBackscatter Communication Systems (ABCS),\
    \ an Energy Harvesting (EH) technique, is\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n3 of 58\nproposed\
    \ to enable wireless charging. This gives room for longer battery life, which\
    \ has\nbeen proposed as a requirement for future wireless networks [33]. With\
    \ the ABCS, devices\nhave an alternative source of power from wireless communication.\
    \ This is consequently\nextending the battery life of devices. Simultaneous Wireless\
    \ and Information Power Trans-\nfer (SWIPT) [34], if enabled by 6G, will resolve\
    \ energy requirements issues at the mobile\nunit [35]. We believe this will enable\
    \ haptics [36], the Internet of Bio-Nano Things, and\nother applications with\
    \ very restrictive energy requirements.\nSeamless and fast ubiquitous communication\
    \ is also desirable in 6G. UAVs and Cube-\nSats, which form the Internet of Space\
    \ things [37], will facilitate this. We have considered\nthe beneﬁts of CubeSats\
    \ compared to the conventional satellites, for example, their low\ncost is desirable\
    \ [38]. Challenges with UAVs such as network handover management and\nhow advanced\
    \ technologies such as AI interface can solve these challenges are treated in\n\
    detail in this paper.\nThis paper provides researchers with a guide to what 6G\
    \ will be. It proposes a\npanoramic vision of 6G, the enabling technologies, and\
    \ the associated challenges. This\nmakes the paper to be robust, compensating\
    \ for the individual lapses in the existing\nliterature. Additionally, we provide\
    \ an extensive analysis of the social, psychological,\nhealth, and commercialization\
    \ challenges associated with 6G, which are missing in earlier\nreports to the\
    \ authors’ best knowledge. The article also introduces new use cases of\n6G in\
    \ education, media and entertainment, tourism and transport, and logistics, which\n\
    have not been given adequate treatment in the existing literature. Finally, we\
    \ discuss the\nmulti-faceted communication capabilities of 6G that will contribute\
    \ immensely to global\nsustainability. We discussed how 6G would bring about drastic\
    \ changes in the business\ndomain to orchestrate economic stability.\nFigure 1\
    \ presents the layout of the paper. In summary, the key discussions in the paper\n\
    are as follows:\n1.\nThe vision of 6G wireless networks, considering the essential\
    \ requirements and\ncomparing them with the existing generations of wireless communication\
    \ networks.\n2.\nA comprehensive review of the 6G enabling technologies such as\

    tourism, transport, and logistics to be enabled by 6G.\n5.\nHarnessing the potentials\
    \ of 6G to meet the UN sustainability goals and business\nmodel tailored towards\

    \ and summarized the proposed research focus.\n7.\nFinally, the lessons learned\
    \ from the survey are delineated, and the conclusion to the\npaper is presented.\n\
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the related\
    \ works\nof literature. Section 3 presents the evolution of wireless networks,\
    \ from 1G to 6G. The\ntechnologies facilitating each generation are introduced,\

    \ of 6G wireless networks [33,39–42]. In particular, David \net al. [33] opined\
    \ that 6G would enable wireless charging and high data rates. The authors \nalso\
    \ identified the need for socio-ethics in the 6G design. Nayak and Patgiri [39]\
    \ proposed \n6G to change the perceptual experience in lifestyle, business, and\
    \ society. The study also \npresents some technology-driven challenges in 6G wireless\
    \ networks and the probable \nsolutions. In [40], the authors examined critical\
    \ features such as security, secrecy, and pri-\nvacy to make 6G truly human-centric.\
    \ Tariq et al. [41] present an extension to the existing \nvision of 5G and show\
    \ speculatively how the 5G vision and technologies can be enhanced \nto drive\
    \ the anticipated 6G. Yang et al. [42] proposed integrating machine learning and\
    \ \nbig data to facilitate intelligent transmission. The application of Big data\
    \ and AI has also \nbeen considered in the scholarly works of literature [24,43,44].\

    \ what 6G will be, clearly outlining the possible challenges associated \nwith\

    \ 6G\nThe analog wireless cellular network, which formed the ﬁrst generation of\
    \ wire-\nless communication, was in use in the 1980s. This facilitated voice calls\
    \ between mobile\nusers. The Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), International\
    \ Mobile Telecommu-\nnications Standard (IMTS), and Point to Call formed the basis\
    \ for the 1G. Additionally,\nsome European countries adopted the Nordic Mobile\
    \ Radio System (NMR). This resulted\nin compatibility challenges. The ﬁrst-generation\
    \ network was monopolized and was not\naffordable for many. 2G brought about high-quality,\
    \ secure mobile voice and basic data\nservices such as fax and text messaging.\
    \ GSM was at the core of the 2G. It was regarded as\nthe “Groupe Speciale Mobile”—a\
    \ group of technical personnel set up by the Postal and\nTelecommunication Administration\
    \ (CEPT) Conference to develop digital mobile commu-\nnication technology [50].\
    \ This was developed as the wireless counterpart of the land-lined\nIntegrated\
    \ Services Digital Network (ISDN) system. The acronym was later changed to\nrefer\
    \ to “Global Systems for Mobile Communication.” The GSM standard was deployed\
    \ in\n1991, using the 900 MHz band [51].\nThe GSM architecture comprises the Mobile\
    \ Station, Network and Switching Subsys-\ntem, and the Base Station Subsystem\
    \ (BSS), also known as the radio network. Additionally,\nincluded is an intelligent\
    \ network subsystem that enables intelligent functionality such\nas prepaid services\
    \ and short message services (SMS). GSM utilized Frequency Division\nMultiple\
    \ Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) for simultaneous\ncommunication\
    \ between the subscriber and the base station [52]. The former allowed com-\n\
    munication using multiple frequencies, while the latter enabled communication\
    \ through\nmultiplexing by time slots. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) was\
    \ developed to facili-\ntate features such as always-on, higher capacity, internet-based\
    \ content, packet-based data\nservices, enabling services such as color internet\
    \ service, email on the move, and visual\ncommunications, multimedia messages,\
    \ and location-based services [53].\nIn the early twenty-ﬁrst century, 3G was\
    \ developed as an upgrade to the features\nin 2G. It permitted faster data rates\
    \ in the range of 300 kbps–30 Mbps and services such\nas video conferencing, remote\
    \ supervision systems, and enabled information services.\nTechnologies such as\
    \ Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Universal\nMobile Telephone\
    \ Service (UMTS) were key to achieving the 3G. The 3rd Generation\nPartnership\
    \ Programme (3GPP) was formed in 1998 to oversee UMTS implementation and\nother\
    \ enabling technology for 3G. 3GPP2 was also formed in the United States to develop\n\
    global speciﬁcations for 3G systems. Critical concepts for evolution toward beyond\
    \ 3G\nnetworks are presented in [54].\nLong-Term Evolution (LTE) was deployed\
    \ in 2009. With the proliferation of smart-\nphones and tablets, online gaming,\
    \ and other services, 4G has been a signiﬁcant success,\nenabling these services\
    \ with its data speed of 100 Mps–1000 Mbps. Although the ﬁrst\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 1709\n7 of 58\nrelease of LTE was in 2005 by 3GPP in release 6, the full development\
    \ was only achieved in\nrelease 8 in 2008. Further details on the technical solutions\
    \ for the 3G long-term evolution\nare reported in [55]. The LTE is often regarded\
    \ as the 4G; however, the LTE-Advanced fea-\ntures such as increased peak data\
    \ rate, spectral efﬁciency, simultaneous active subscribers,\nand improved cell-edge\
    \ performance make it the true 4G. Key performance indicators for\n4G LTE are\
    \ given by [56,57], and radial basis function neural network pathloss prediction\n\
    model in LTE network was reported in [58]. A higher data rate was achieved and\
    \ lower\nlatency in 20 ms–100 ms, which was lower than that obtained in 3G. 4G\
    \ facilitated video\nstreaming, online gaming, and more. The need for a higher\
    \ data rate and lower latency\ngave room for interests in 5G.\n5G commercialization\
    \ started in 2019, and it opens up new use cases in the Internet\nof Things (IoT),\
    \ immersive gaming, virtual reality, and more. 6G is expected to have a\nhigher\
    \ data rate in the range 100 Gbps–1 Tbps and latency lower than 1ms. This opens\
    \ up\napplications in holographic communication, tactile internet, extended reality,\
    \ and more.\nTable 2 summarizes the technology, data rates, and supporting applications\
    \ from 1G to 6G.\nThe change in latency from 1G to 6G is also shown. Furthermore,\

    \ and smart implants in 6G.\n4. Vision of 6G Wireless Communication\nThere have\
    \ been different descriptions of what the 6G network should be by re-\nsearchers\
    \ [40,45,79–81]. Furthermore, the authors in [82] deﬁned it as a technology that\
    \ will\nmake human society a “Ubiquitous Intelligent Mobile Society.” In [41],\
    \ the authors envi-\nsioned 6G to facilitate super smart cities with pervasive\
    \ autonomous systems. It is expected\nthat 6G will be supported by existing 5G\
    \ infrastructure such as Software-Deﬁned Net-\nworking [83], Network Function\
    \ Virtualization (NFV) [84], and Network Slicing (NS) [85]\ntogether with new\
    \ infrastructure. In order to give a future assessment of how well 6G has\naccomplished\
    \ the required cases, this paper examines various visions and requirements\nprojected\
    \ by different researchers [42–44]. It presents a blend of what 6G will be. Just\
    \ as we\nenvisage, some researchers also believe there will be a pervasive application\
    \ of AI to make\n6G a reality [20,70]. There is also research on optical wireless\
    \ communication to enable\nindoor and outdoor communication at high-data rates\
    \ [86]. Simultaneous Wireless and\nInformation Power Transfer (SWIPT) [35], which\
    \ is an Energy Harvesting (EH) technique,\nhas been proposed to improve the battery\
    \ life of UEs [40,41].\n6G is expected to support smart cities, the Internet of\
    \ Everything (IoE) [39], tactile\ndevices [9], and more. The requirements are\
    \ high reliability [7], the high data rate in the\norder of 1 Tb/s, ultra-low\
    \ latency of less than 1ms, high energy and spectral efﬁciency [87],\nsecurity\
    \ and privacy [88], and ubiquitous connectivity that connects everyone, including\n\
    people in rural areas [89,90]. The Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC)\n\
    required in 6G networks is also under more stringent conditions than that obtainable\
    \ in 5G,\nwith delay jitters, context awareness, and UAV/Satellite compatibility\
    \ being considered.\nSustainability is also desirable in future wireless networks,\
    \ and there is a need for Green\nNetworking architecture that will be environmentally\
    \ friendly [91].\nTable 4 presents the vision and requirements projected by different\
    \ researchers. This\ngives a sneak peek at the ongoing discussion on 6G networks.\
    \ The focus and future\nprojections are also highlighted. Services and Key Performance\
    \ Indicators [92,93] are given,\nas shown in Table 5. Additionally, applications\
    \ such as immersive extended reality, Brain–\nComputer Interface (BCI), Connected\
    \ Robotic and Autonomous System (CRAS), and more,\nproposed to be supported by\
    \ 6G, are presented in Table 6. Figure 2 shows a brief overview\nthat compares\
    \ the Key Performance Indicators in 5G and those expected in 6G.\nSensors 2021,\

    \ presented earlier in Table 4. Yang et al. [42]\npresented an AI-enabled architecture\
    \ for 6G networks divided into an intelligent sensing\nlayer, data mining and\

    \ Layer system [108,109],\nand optimization of energy management strategy for\

    \ Several deep learning techniques with\npotential applications to networking\

    trafﬁc classiﬁers (TC), leveraging automatically extracted features, coping with\
    \ encrypted\ntrafﬁc, and reﬂecting their complex trafﬁc trajectories. Here, different\
    \ DL techniques from\n(standard) TC are broached. Although the mobile context\
    \ declined, the latter outcome can\nappeal to the broader umbrella of encrypted\
    \ TC tasks. Finally, the performance of these DL\nclassiﬁers is critically investigated\

    \ been identiﬁed with the application of AI in wireless networks.\nGetting training\
    \ data is cumbersome, and there are practically no training data to work\nwith\
    \ as we have in other ﬁelds such as natural language processing and computer vision.\n\
    These data require computational and processing resources, which leads to communi-\n\
    cation costs [130]. The several features of the data, with changing values, also\
    \ presents\nanother challenge as working with higher dimensionality [131] is cumbersome.\
    \ The au-\nthors in [132] presented ten challenges associated with Machine Learning\
    \ applications in\n6G. The challenges identiﬁed are end-to-end qualiﬁed service\
    \ provision, cross-layer coop-\neration, dynamic online learning with proactive\
    \ exploration, scalability, efﬁcient dataset\ngeneration, computation overhead\
    \ deployment, feasibility veriﬁcation, standardization,\nlearning efﬁciency, and\
    \ deployment in distributed and centralized systems. The authors\nin [44] also\
    \ identiﬁed challenges: Training issues, lack of explainability, interoperability\n\
    and bounding performance, and uncertainty in generability.\nDeep-learning-based\
    \ solutions require high computational complexity, which might\nnot ﬁt in current\
    \ mobile phones [109]. Barring the complexity, Artiﬁcial Neural Network\n(ANN)\
    \ based RL algorithm must be meticulously designed to reduce computational re-\n\
    sources required on these devices [23]. Quantum communication [26] offers a promising\n\
    approach to circumventing the challenge of limited computational resources and\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency [26]. Applying Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also comes\
    \ with the trade-off\nchallenge between accuracy and computational/energy requirements\
    \ [23]. Thus, identify-\ning the right use cases for ML/DL applications is more\
    \ of a priority than tweaking neural\nnetworks and network procedures [133].\n\
    5.2. Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)\
    \ [107] are envisaged as a key enabling tech-\nnology in 6G, just like massive\
    \ MIMO in 5G [17]. They have been proved to improve the\nperformance of networks\
    \ [134] and with virtually no interference [135]. They are envi-\nsioned to facilitate\
    \ energy efﬁciency because they are relatively passive and only require\na limited\
    \ number of active antennas at the BS to achieve massive MIMO gains [95]. The\n\
    advantage of RIS is not just them having passive elements that improve energy\

    \ [139,143]. Table 9 juxtaposes the\ntypes of metasurfaces, classifying them based\
    \ on structure, energy consumption, and\nmore. The authors in [138] posited that\
    \ RIS improves energy efﬁciency as they do not\nrequire power ampliﬁers, which\
    \ contrasts with other relay systems. Consequently, the\nRIS ameliorates the problem\
    \ of interference in an ultra-dense network since the RIS is\npassive [67]. Being\
    \ passive also makes it easy to be deployed, and they can be deployed\non buildings\
    \ and structures. It also can be conﬁgured to provide security at the physical\n\
    layer [67,144,145]. The RIS also supports low-power device-to-device (D2D) communi-\n\
    cation, which helps to actualize Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer\n\
    (SWIPT) [67,146]. We compare the features of RIS with existing relay systems in\
    \ Table 10.\nTable 9. Types of metasurfaces being used for the design of 6G wireless\

    \ beamforming at the RIS.\nTherefore, RIS improves spectral efﬁciency [138]. Operating\
    \ passively, RIS help reduce\nthe implementation cost of future wireless communication\
    \ [87,135]. In addition to pas-\nsive beamforming, which provides communication\
    \ between the user and BS, RIS use in\ninformation transfer through sensors has\
    \ also been proposed [137,147]. According to the\nauthors in [138], other advantages\
    \ of RIS are: they are more energy-efﬁcient and environ-\nmental friendly compared\
    \ to conventional relay systems and compatible with standards\nand hardware of\
    \ earlier wireless generations. RIS is also being considered to be deployed\n\
    to secure wireless networks [148–150].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n18 of 58\nTable\

    \ the RIS looks promising to facilitate communication beyond 5G, some\nchallenges\
    \ have been posed. In [152], the limitation in the phase range of unit cells making\n\
    up the aperture was identiﬁed. Achieving a full-phase range may require complex\
    \ cell\ntopology, which would increase hardware complexity. Increasing hardware\
    \ complexity\ndefeats the aim of energy efﬁciency proposed in 6G networks. Another\
    \ challenge identiﬁed\nis the quantization of the phase range of the unit cells.\
    \ The ﬂexibility of RIS is also desired\nso it can adjust to the dynamic characteristic\
    \ of the reﬂected wavefront.\nDynamic modulation of RIS using low-power semiconductor\
    \ elements such as PIN\ndiode was proposed to address dynamic reconﬁgurability\
    \ problems [152,153]. This was\nimplemented in [67], and a variable resistor load\
    \ was also proposed to control the reﬂec-\ntion amplitude. However, controlling\
    \ the reﬂection amplitude and phase shift is costly\nin practice because it is\
    \ better to implement discrete amplitude/phase-shift levels that\nrequire a small\
    \ amount of electromechanical systems, i.e., microelectromechanical sys-\ntems\
    \ (MEMS) [135] have made reconﬁguring easy, through controlling phase shifters\
    \ in\nreal-time.\nAnother challenge associated with the RIS is estimating the\
    \ channel information [135,154],\ncorrectly. Most of the existing works have been\
    \ based on the conjecture that RIS has perfect\nchannel state information. This\
    \ has not been proved to be true and highly unlikely in prac-\ntice because the\
    \ RIS does not have radio resources for channel estimation [155], although\nequipping\
    \ the RIS with a low-power RF chain for channel estimation capability has been\n\
    proposed [67]. However, this compromises the reduced complexity and energy-saving\
    \ fea-\ntures desired in 6G networks. Ironically, RIS can be deployed to allow\
    \ energy transfer [156].\nThe high-dimensional channels are estimated in severe\
    \ under-sampling constraints [152],\nmaking accurate estimation of Channel Information\
    \ challenging. Consequently, it is difﬁ-\ncult to actualize the RIS phase control\
    \ due to imperfect channel estimation and hardware\ncomplexity [87].\nModels have\
    \ been proposed to resolve the challenge of channel estimation, one of\nwhich\
    \ is the Ray-tracing-based methods [157], which were proposed to estimate the\
    \ channel\ninformation by the authors in [18]. However, they are costly and require\
    \ stringent site\ninformation [67]. In [152], the knowledge of signal covariance\
    \ matrix through extensive\nresearch in random matrix theory and high-dimensional\
    \ statistics was proposed. This\ncorroborates the dependence on basic sciences\
    \ as suggested in [40]. The authors in [158]\nproposed a three-stage mechanism\
    \ for channel estimation: sparse matrix factorization,\nambiguity elimination,\
    \ and matrix completion, respectively. The methods used were\nbased on mathematical\
    \ tools of random spatial processes and stochastic geometry. The\ntheoretical\
    \ framework used was validated with Monte Carlo Simulation. A minimum\nmean squared\
    \ error (MMSE) based channel estimation protocol between the BS and RIS to\nserially\
    \ estimate each RIS link was proposed in [155]. Machine learning, Deep learning,\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 1709\n19 of 58\nand Federated learning models have also been\
    \ proposed to help resolve this challenge at a\nlower computational cost [159–161].\n\
    A deep reinforcement learning model was proposed in [162] to predict the RIS re-\n\
    ﬂection matrices with minimal training overhead. A joint compressive sensing and\
    \ deep\nlearning solution were also proposed in [159]. This designs the LIS reﬂection\
    \ matrix with\nnegligible training overhead. The idea presented in the paper,\
    \ however auspicious, was\nproved in theory but not assessed with practical data.\
    \ Further research is needed in re-\nsearching this with practical implementation.\
    \ Although this is a daunting task as Machine\nlearning methods are not error-free,\
    \ getting training data sufﬁcient for deep learning mod-\nels is quite cumbersome\
    \ [163]. Nevertheless, this is a viable research area to explore. It is\nimperative\
    \ to model the channel with real practical data to assess its accuracy and compare\n\
    it with existing channel estimation models that have been deployed.\n5.3. UAVs/\

    more, the key enabling techniques for UAV communications, joint Tx/Rx beam alignment,\n\
    beam tracking, multi-beam forming, full-duplex relaying, and the potential challenges\n\
    are discussed extensively. Remote Controlled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (RC-UAVs)\
    \ are\nenvisioned to aid heterogeneous wireless communication [180]. Cooperative\
    \ game theory\nwas deployed to select the best UAV during the handover process\
    \ and optimize handover\namong UAVs by reducing; handover latency, end-to-end\
    \ delay, and signalling overheads.\nFurther, Software Deﬁned Network with Media\
    \ Independent Handover UAV (SDN-MIH-\nUAV) architecture was employed as forwarding\
    \ switches to achieve seamless mobility.\nThe ﬂying networks can be deployed to\
    \ provide internet services to disaster-struck\nareas. It will facilitate the\
    \ ubiquitous connectivity being desired in 6G networks. It is one\nof the major\
    \ enabling technologies for achieving ultra-low latency communication [24].\n\
    UAVs also have a more robust line of sight than ﬁxed BS and degree of freedom\
    \ controlled\nby mobility. This is an ongoing development in harnessing the enormous\
    \ potentials of\nUAVs for wireless communication. UAVs can withstand geographical\
    \ and environmental\nlimitations on wireless communications such as ships on the\
    \ ocean. Facebook is partnering\nwith Airbus to make drones that beam the internet\
    \ from high altitudes. This helps to\nprovide wireless connectivity in rural areas.\
    \ A similar trend is Google deploying Loon in\nsome rural communities. However,\
    \ this uses balloons and not UAVs. UAVs are different\nfrom Satellite communication\
    \ as they operate at a much lower altitude. The swarm of\nself-governing drones\
    \ also possesses ﬂexibility and can be used to collect, deliver, and\ntransmit\
    \ telematics. They also help with mobility and handover management in wireless\n\
    networks [42,165].\n5.3.2. CubeSat Communication\nSatellite communication will\
    \ be key in actualizing 6G networks, and miniaturized\nor small satellites are\
    \ being developed. Small satellites have a relatively low design and\ndeployment\
    \ cost. They also have lower implementation complexity. These satellites are\n\
    deployed in Low Earth Orbit (LEOs), which allows them to have a low latency communi-\n\
    cation. LEO satellites are proposed in [82] as the most prospective satellite\
    \ communication.\nFor example, SpaceX, Facebook, OneWeb, and recently, Amazon\
    \ are the key players who\nhave existing LEO satellite projects for internet-beaming\
    \ [181].\nThere are different satellites based on their weights; pico-satellites,\
    \ also known as\nCubeSats, have emerged as the most popular [182]. However, most\
    \ of the CubeSats research\nfocused on remote-sensing applications and not much\
    \ consideration on communication\napplications. The authors proposed the Internet\
    \ of Space things in [37], and CubeSats will\nbe a powerful technology to facilitate\
    \ this. Additionally, it is worthy to note that some\nliterature has expanded\
    \ space communication to include high altitude and Geostationary\nOrbit Satellite\
    \ (GEO) [183,184]. Table 11 compares UAV and CubeSat communication,\ncomparing\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 1709\n21 of 58\n5.3.3. Challenges with UAV/Satellite Communication\n\
    The authors in [185] identiﬁed some challenges with UAV-enabled Wireless systems,\n\
    such as the topology of the network changing with the nodes and the links altering.\
    \ The\nrouting protocol requires a complex implementation; maintaining user sessions\
    \ with the\nintermittent transfer from an out-of-service UAV to an active UAV\
    \ and energy conservation\nin UAVs also pose challenges. UAVs have limited communication\
    \ resources, nodes are\nnot ﬁxed, and the channel can be impaired. Therefore,\
    \ the challenges with UAVs can be\ncategorized as challenges with resource management\
    \ [186], resource allocation, routing,\nand energy constraints. Applications of\
    \ AI-controlled UAVs have been suggested to\nsolve these issues [24], and deep\
    \ reinforcement learning is proposed to enhance handover\namongst several UAVs\
    \ [42].\nBuilding the UAVs to work in different environments by enhancing the\
    \ capability\nof the networking protocol helps to address the issue of intermittent\
    \ network changes\nand channel impairment [185]. Optimizing interactions between\
    \ nodes, such that a node\ncan go to sleep when they are redundant, reduces power\
    \ consumption and, subsequently,\nthe energy requirement of the UAVs. Overlaying\
    \ UAV-to-UAV (U2U) connection and\ncellular ground user uplink (GUE-UL) communication\
    \ was suggested by [29] as a better\nalternative in urban areas for simultaneously\
    \ maximizing GUE-UL performance and\nguaranteeing a minimum U2U coverage rate\
    \ of 100 kps to the majority of UAV pairs.\nOne of the signiﬁcant challenges with\
    \ CubeSats and other miniature satellites is the\nlack of a standardized channel\
    \ model [187]. Some models have been presented, such as\nRF and optical links,\
    \ but the channel presents signal attenuation because of molecular\nabsorption\
    \ and scattering losses by gas molecules and aerosols in the atmosphere. Addi-\n\
    tionally, background noise and the stars, beam divergence loss due to beam diffraction\n\
    close to the receiver, atmospheric turbulence, and pointing loss attributable\
    \ to satellite\nvibration [182]. As noted by the authors in [37], other challenges\
    \ with CubeSats are long\ndelays, signaling issues, and topological variations.\
    \ There are also challenges with integra-\ntion with next-generation networks,\
    \ data scheduling on account of the limited transceiver.\nA deep learning approach\
    \ was proposed in [96] to resolve resource allocation challenges\nin CubeSats.\n\
    5.4. Terahertz Communication and Optical Wireless Technology\nRF frequency band\
    \ below 6GHz has been exhausted, and there are research interests\nin higher spectrum.\
    \ Spectral efﬁciency can be increased by increasing bandwidth while\napplying\
    \ massive MIMO. This is achievable at higher frequency bands (millimeter-wave,\n\
    Terahertz, and Free Space Optics). The authors in [188] proposed the opportunity\
    \ for\nterabit-per-second data rates, high energy efﬁciency, and miniaturized\
    \ transceiver size.\nTransmitting at higher bandwidth also makes an application\
    \ such as Holographic communi-\ncation, which requires very high data rate, permissible.\
    \ Akyildiz et al. [69] identiﬁed some\nTHz communication applications obtainable\
    \ at the macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale.\nThere has been development in\
    \ a chip-wireless network on chip (WNoC)-for THz band\ntransmission [189]. However,\
    \ characterization of the channel has been a challenge that\ncasts doubt on the\
    \ practicability.\nRappaport et al. [12] also identiﬁed wireless cognition, hyper-active\
    \ position location,\nsensing, and imaging as some of the applications obtainable\
    \ when transmitting above the\n100 GHz range. Optical Wireless Technologies such\
    \ as light ﬁdelity, visible light commu-\nnication, optical camera communication,\
    \ and Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication\nhave been used since the 4G. They\
    \ provide a high data rate, low latency, and security [48].\nVLC is a good cost-effective\
    \ means of alleviating the challenge of spectrum shortage in the\nsub 6 GHz band.\
    \ It provides a higher frequency spectrum and dual utility for light bulbs:\n\
    illumination and communication [190]. It makes communication achievable wherever\n\
    light bulbs are being used, thereby facilitating the ubiquitous connectivity expected\
    \ in 6G\nnetworks [191].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n22 of 58\nFurthermore, they\
    \ also facilitate underwater communication [192]. VLC possesses\nhigh bandwidth,\
    \ and it is immune to interference from other electromagnetic sources [15].\n\
    VLC also provides system security [193], and it is expected to break the terabit-per\
    \ second\nbarrier [6]. FSO allows broadband communication through the transmission\
    \ of modulated\nlight signals through free space [194]. This provides a cost-effective\
    \ alternative communica-\ntion for a low-income population [195]. It can be deployed\
    \ in terrestrial and inter-satellite\ncommunication [16]. Table 12 compares THz\

    \ and more are also considered.\nChallenges with Terahertz Communication and OWT\n\
    THz communication has inherent short propagation capability. It becomes difﬁcult\
    \ to\ndetect weak signals as sensitivity decreases at the THz range [198]. At\
    \ higher frequencies,\nbond cables suffer signal degradation. As presented by\
    \ the authors in [8], communication\nin the THz range is susceptible to severe\
    \ path-loss and atmospheric absorption, hardware\ncompatibility, waveform, channels,\
    \ and protocols. The authors in [152] also presented\nthree challenges with transmitting\
    \ at a higher frequency band: packaging and interconnect\ntechniques that provide\
    \ reliable interconnection between interior and exterior environment,\ntransceiver\
    \ design that meets the compact physical size power efﬁciency, and issue with\n\
    standardization and measurements [199]. They suggested cutting-edge technology\
    \ in\nmicro-machining, low-temperature co-ﬁred ceramic (LTCC) [200], and additive\
    \ manufac-\nturing techniques in improving packaging challenges. Spatially over-sampled\
    \ antennas and\nphased array architectures can be leveraged to improve the transceiver\
    \ design, and electro-\noptic sampling can solve the issue of measurements. Spatially\
    \ over-sampled antenna,\nnew phased-array antenna, and compact computational approaches\
    \ also are promising in\nactualizing accurate beam steering with less exponential\
    \ power [12].\nYifei et al. [49] also identiﬁed the following challenges with\
    \ THz communication:\nsevere path-loss, weak diffraction effect at short wavelength,\
    \ excessive attenuation from\nthe resonance of molecules in the air, and weak\
    \ diffraction that result in sensitivity to\nblocking and shadows, superfast channel\
    \ ﬂuctuation. Zhai et al. [201] proposed THzphism,\na frequency-based beam spreading\
    \ technique that utilizes several true-time delay (TTD) de-\nvices in a phased\
    \ array antenna. This helps to improve angular coverage while maintaining\nthe\
    \ distance covered by the THz system. This encourages the adoption of phased-array-\n\
    based beamforming in reducing severe pathloss. Precoding techniques such as analog\n\
    beamforming, hybrid precoding, and delay-phase precoding were also proposed by\
    \ the\nauthors in [202] as providential in reducing the severe-path loss challenge\
    \ experienced in\nTHz transmission.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n23 of 58\nAkyildiz\
    \ et al. [69] considered the challenges associated with THz band device tech-\n\
    nologies and THz band communication networks. They also identiﬁed security as\
    \ another\nchallenge of THz band systems. Petrov et al. [188] identiﬁed the following\
    \ challenges\nassociated with THz transmission: design of supporting THz electronics,\
    \ THz channel\nmodeling [187], coverage planning, effective medium access control,\
    \ and support for\nnodes mobility. Ideally, a photonic solution would be a viable\
    \ option for transmission in\nTHz [49,203], but it has a larger component size\
    \ [45]. Plasmon-based THz link components\nhave also been promising in facilitating\
    \ THz communication as they have miniaturized\nsizes and operate at ultra-high\
    \ data rates [45].\nHybridization of micro-LED matrices and CMOS driver arrays\
    \ on a single chip will\nalso be required to solve the challenges of huge matrices\
    \ [6]. As the Doppler effect is\nmore severe in the THz range and channel status\
    \ is always changing, spatial consistency\nis proposed to give realistic and updated\
    \ CIRs [12]. The authors in [6] also presented the\nneed for the complex device\
    \ by parallelizing several chips and introducing a dedicated\noptical imaging\
    \ system leading to optical beamforming, which will signiﬁcantly increase\ncellular\
    \ throughput. A CMOS-based modulation circuit was proposed in [41] to get an\n\
    improved performance gain.\nVLC is posed with the challenge of interference with\
    \ ambient light sources, and it is\nproposed that increase in VLC devices will\
    \ result in interference between VLC devices [15].\nSignal jamming [204] and data\
    \ snooping are also some of the security challenges with\nVLC that need to be\
    \ resolved [193]. Handover management, conﬁguration algorithm\nfor both illumination\
    \ and conﬁguration, and compatibility with existing spectrums are\nchallenges\
    \ identiﬁed with VLC [190]. LED transmissions provide a short-range susceptible\n\
    to absorption, shadowing, and beam dispersion [191]. VLC and FSO require line\
    \ of sight\nfor communication. Non-light sight communication attributable to obstruction\
    \ on the beam\npath makes communication difﬁcult. There is also doubt on the safety\
    \ of lasers [194]. Just\nas VLC, FSO is susceptible to absorption, scattering,\
    \ scintillation, atmospheric turbulence,\nand other hostile environmental conditions\
    \ [195,205]. Geometric loss, background noise,\nand misalignment error are other\
    \ challenges of FSO identiﬁed in [86].\n5.5. Cell-Free Massive MIMO\nThe combination\
    \ of Time Division Duplex (TDD), massive MIMO operation [206],\ndensely distributed\
    \ network [207], and user-centric network [208] refers to the ubiquitous\ncell-free\
    \ massive MIMO [22]. Cell-free Massive MIMO, which is the generally adopted\n\
    terminology, combines the distributed MIMO and Massive MIMO [68] concepts such\
    \ that\nthere are no boundaries and cells in the network. This allows users to\
    \ move seamlessly\nfrom one network to another. It cancels out interference problems\
    \ and reduces the frequent\nhandover experienced in current networks, thereby\
    \ improving user experience. Figure 7\nshows a pictorial layout of the Cell-free\
    \ Massive MIMO communication system.\nCell-free Massive MIMO has signiﬁcantly\
    \ outperformed existing small-cell systems\nthroughput and more resistant to shadow\
    \ fading correlation [68]. Massive MIMO was pro-\nposed by Alamu et al. [209]\
    \ to improve Energy Efﬁciency and Spectral Efﬁciency. Utilizing\nspatial multiplexing\
    \ in Massive MIMO allows multiple users to share spectrum resources\nefﬁciently.\
    \ Cell-free Massive MIMO presents high spectral efﬁciency, system scalability,\n\
    and almost-optimal linear processing [22]. It can also meet the requirements of\
    \ ubiquitous,\nultra-reliable low latency communication desired in 6G networks.\
    \ The potentials of larger\nintelligent surfaces (LIS) in Massive MIMO operations\
    \ have been identiﬁed in [20] and also\nin LEO satellite communications using\
    \ full frequency reuse (FFR) [210].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n24 of 58\nSensors\

    \ MIMO: practical user-centric approaches, scalable power control, and the need\
    \ for\nadvanced distributed signal processing (SP). These are areas that need\
    \ research focus.\n5.6. Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Systems\nMany papers\
    \ addressing the vision and requirements have proposed blockchain\nadoption in\
    \ 6G wireless networks [47,81]. Blockchain is proposed to provide network\ndecentralization\
    \ [6,40], spectrum sharing [9,81,95], and security [41,45,48]. The authors\nin\
    \ [47] presented blockchain as one of the applications of 6G. Blockchain is a\
    \ form of\ndistributed ledger [48] that serves as a database with several nodes\
    \ replicating and saving\nan identical copy of the ledger. It is a perfect complement\
    \ to the massive IoT with improved\ninteroperability, security, privacy, reliability,\
    \ and scalability [32,213]. This makes it a good\nenabling technology to improve\
    \ the integrity and security of future wireless networks.\nBlockchain is also\
    \ being considered for the ﬂedgling 5G communication network.\nBlockchain was\
    \ proposed to give 5G IoT integrity, accelerated data change, lower cost,\nsecurity,\
    \ immutability [32]. Integration of machine learning with blockchain in 5G and\n\
    beyond has also been proposed [28]. Blockchain provides real-time data delivery,\
    \ resilience,\nand low latency to the network [214]. The integration of edge computing\
    \ with blockchain\nis also a desirable research ﬁeld. This provides reliable access\
    \ and control of the network,\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n25 of 58\nstorage computation\
    \ over a large number of distributed edge nodes, and improved network\nsecurity,\
    \ data integrity, and computation validity of the system [215]. Jocovic et al.\
    \ [216] pro-\nposed integrating Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and blockchain\
    \ to provide enormously\nhigh security, transparency, credibility, and immutability\
    \ of stored data. The application of\nBlockchain in UAVs is also being considered\
    \ [28].\nChallenges with Blockchain Technology\nAlthough blockchain technology\
    \ is proposed to give security and privacy to future\nwireless networks, the system\
    \ on its own is not resistant to cyber-attacks. Security and\nprivacy have been\
    \ identiﬁed as concerns in blockchain technology [217]. Xie et al. [217]\nalso\
    \ identiﬁed a limited throughput, energy efﬁciency, lack of incentive and punishment\n\
    mechanism and regulation as some of the challenges associated with blockchain\
    \ application\nin smart cities, enabled by wireless communication. Scalability\
    \ has also been identiﬁed as\na challenge in blockchain deployment [28,215].\n\
    Yang et al. [215] also identiﬁed research challenges with integrated blockchain\
    \ and\nedge computing systems such as scalability enhancement, security and privacy,\
    \ self-\norganization, function integration, and resource management. The integrity\
    \ provided\nby the immutability of the blockchain comes at the expense of higher\
    \ computational capa-\nbility and delay performance. This can be resolved by applying\
    \ the edge cloud [79]. Big\nData can also be adapted to perform pattern recognition\
    \ on ledger transactions to give more\nsecurity. AI can also be leveraged to design\
    \ a new generation blockchain that supports\nautomatic generation of smart contacts,\
    \ enhanced security under malicious attacks, and\nhighly ﬂexible operations [215].\n\
    5.7. Ambient Backscatter Communication\nAmbient backscatter (AB) was proposed\
    \ by [6] to enable tiny devices to operate\nwithout a battery, such that they\
    \ are powered by redirecting ambient RF signals with-\nout requiring active RF\
    \ transmission. Ambient backscatter communication is a form of\nbackscatter communication\
    \ that can harvest energy from devices in its “ambient” en-\nvironment such as\
    \ Wi-Fi, TV, and RF signal to modulate information [218]. When this\npassive backscatter\
    \ system is integrated with an active transmission system, it forms the\nsymbiotic\
    \ radio (SR) [219]. This addresses the energy efﬁciency problems in low-power\n\
    consumption devices such as sensor networks. This helps to reduce the cost of\
    \ devices\nwith low-power components and reduced infrastructure [31]. There is\
    \ also no need to\nallocate a different frequency spectrum for ambient backscattering\
    \ communication systems\n(ABCS), thereby improving spectrum resource utilization\
    \ [27]. When perfected, ambient\nbackscatter communication will enhance the battery\
    \ life of mobile devices [218].\nAmbient Backscatter Communication (ABC) sensors\
    \ were deployed to solve the prob-\nlem posed by the fusion of local decisions\
    \ over multiple-access fading channels in WSN,\nconsidering the IoT vertical [220].\
    \ ABC sensors are deployed to detect the presence or\nabsence of a given phenomenon\
    \ and transmit their decisions to a multiple-antenna fusion\ncenter reader (FCR).\
    \ In this case, a part of an incident RF ambient signal is reﬂected. This\nfacilitates\
    \ the development of decision fusion rules in the full and statistical channel\
    \ state\ninformation (CSI) scenarios to enhance their implementation and lower\
    \ computational\ncomplexity. To increase the data rate of passive transceiver-to-transceiver\
    \ communications\nfor ambient backscatter (AB), Qian et al. [221] employed M-PSK\
    \ for backscattering and\nderived the optimal multi-level energy detector and\
    \ the closed-form symbol error rate\n(SER). A 4PSK-AB hardware prototype that\
    \ gives a data rate of 20 kb/s was developed\nto integrate the 4PSK-modulated\
    \ transmitter, multilevel detector, and energy harvester.\nRecently, the issue\
    \ of symbol detection in ABCS with the multi-antenna reader was ad-\ndressed [222].\
    \ Leveraging the ON-OFF keying modulation, the optimal detector, which\ncan avoid\
    \ the error ﬂoor phenomenon, was devised. Additionally, multiple antennas\nare\
    \ employed at the reader to improve the bit error rate (BER) [223,224] and extend\
    \ the\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n26 of 58\ntag–reader communication range. Table\
    \ 13 compares ambient backscatter communication\nwith traditional backscatter\
    \ communication.\nTable 13. Differences between traditional backscatter and ambient\
    \ backscatter communication systems.\nAmbient Backscatter Communication\nTraditional\
    \ Backscatter Communication\nUtilizes ambient RF\nRequires special-purpose power\

    Not as energy-efﬁcient\nThis Table compares and contrasts ambient backscatter\
    \ communication with traditional backscatter communication. This is with respect\
    \ to\nthe mode of operation, energy efﬁciency, and more.\nChallenges with Ambient\
    \ Backscatter Communication\nThere is a limited coverage area for operation as\
    \ backscatter transmitters need to be\nplaced near their RF source [27]. This\
    \ means that one has to be close to the backscatter trans-\nmitter to utilize\
    \ the system. This limits mobility while retaining communication. In [27],\nthe\
    \ authors also identiﬁed reduced transmission performance on account of interference\n\
    between transmit and receive antenna thanks to proximity and the dynamics of ambient\n\
    signals, data transmission scheduling for backscatter devices as challenges. ABCS\
    \ are also\nsusceptible to security threats [27].\nLiu et al. [225] identiﬁed\
    \ at least three challenges associated with ambient backscatter\ncommunication,\
    \ namely: the challenge of extracting backscatter information owing to weak\n\
    signals, the need for less-complex digital signal processing techniques, and hardware\
    \ archi-\ntecture need for a centralized controller to control communication.\
    \ Challenges associated\nwith EE and SE and compatibility with other wireless\
    \ communication systems have also\nbeen identiﬁed [31].\n5.8. Quantum Communication\n\
    One question posed by the authors in [133] is what happens when massive MIMO is\n\
    combined with quantum communication or molecular communication? There have been\n\
    growing research interests in quantum communications and how they can be adopted\
    \ to\nB5G networks. Quantum computing gives high data rates and security [41].\
    \ Quantum\ncommunication [226] was proposed as enabling architecture in 6G as\
    \ it has the potential\nof accelerating the speed of information processing leading\
    \ to a more optimal solution in\n6G communication [95]. Quantum communication\
    \ may also provide a shield from cyber-\nattacks through sophisticated quantum\
    \ computing and quantum communication [30].\nFuture quantum internet is proposed\
    \ to be likely based on long-distance quantum op-\ntical communication suitably\
    \ interfaced with solid-state nodes for quantum information\nprocessing [227].\
    \ There are also interests in quantum-based satellite communication [228] and\n\
    quantum machine learning and deep learning for 6G [229]. Quantum computing can\
    \ signifi-\ncantly accelerate and enhance AI algorithms that require big data\
    \ and massive training [81].\nThe concept of quantum optical communication opens\
    \ up innovation in telecommunication\nand ICT, and quantum optics is a providential\
    \ paradigm for the transmission and control\nof optical signals to have a better\
    \ degree of freedom [26]. The authors in [26] delineated the\ninfusion of quantum\
    \ and THz communication in the actualization of 6G.\nChallenges with Quantum Communication\n\
    While channels of classical computing are well treated within the framework of\
    \ classi-\ncal information theory, the quantum channel is not entirely understood\
    \ [229]. Constraints\nidentiﬁed in quantum internet by authors in [230] are quantum\
    \ measurement, entan-\nglement, non-cloning, and teleporting. Getting supporting\
    \ infrastructure for quantum\ncommunication with quantum switches and routers\
    \ becomes difﬁcult as a result of the\nnon-cloning theorem [229]. Cacciapuoti\
    \ et al. [230] also identiﬁed decoherence and ﬁdelity,\nentanglement distribution,\
    \ and deployment challenges as some of the challenges associ-\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    \ Additionally, requirements that some enabling technologies do not favor or serve\n\
    more as challenges are noted. The blank spaces are requirements that have no direct\
    \ link with the mapped enabling technology, e.g.,\nambient backscatter is more\
    \ directly related to energy efﬁciency, and the link has not been established\
    \ with latency and other ﬁelds that are\nconspicuously blank.\n6. 6G Applications\n\
    Every generation of wireless networks has facilitated new applications, and 6G\
    \ is\nnot an exception. The need for higher data rates, lower latency, high reliability,\
    \ and\nmore have given rise to the development and deployment of new wireless\
    \ generation\nnetworks. In this section, we examine the applications to be facilitated\
    \ by 6G. Although\nthese or similar applications have been proposed to be enabled\
    \ by 5G, 5G cannot meet the\nrequirements to facilitate these applications seamlessly\
    \ at the current development stage.\nSome limitations in 5G, such as scarce bandwidth\
    \ and high-energy consumption, have\nbeen identiﬁed [231]. Although 5G tests have\
    \ shown prospects with the actualization of\na data rate of 8 Gbps [232] and 1\
    \ Gbps at 6.5 km distance [233], these are still below the\npeak data of 20 Gbps\
    \ proposed in the literature. Therefore, existing 5G networks cannot\nmeet high-speed\
    \ intensive applications such as holographic communication, which require\n1 Tbps\
    \ for seamless communication [39]. Other limitations identiﬁed with 5G wireless\n\
    networks are high interference due to massive interconnection, insufﬁcient computing\n\
    capacity, and lack of ubiquitous connectivity. Hence there is a need for 6G communication,\n\
    which promises better features than 5G.\nSome of the applications to be facilitated\
    \ and fully enabled by 6G are holographic\ncommunication, teleoperated driving,\
    \ tactile internet, Industry 4.0, and more. New applica-\ntions that were not\
    \ considered in the 5G context, such as IoBNT and Digital replica, are also\n\
    introduced in this paper. Table 15 gives a summarized description of these applications.\n\
    Furthermore, we outline the challenges in achieving some of these applications.\
    \ Addition-\nally, desirable features of these applications are considered. These\
    \ applications, the 5G\nlimitations, and how 6G wireless networks will enable\
    \ them are highlighted in this section.\nIn this literature, it has been established\
    \ that the existing features of 5G are not efﬁcient\nenough to enable the requirements\
    \ of these technologies. We consider each application in\nthis section, pointing\
    \ out some of the requirements that make 6G an ideal candidate for\nthese applications.\n\

    Blockchain is postulated to provide security for 6G networks. They also\nrequire\
    \ low latency, reliable connectivity, and scalability, which 6G\nnetworks will\
    \ provide.\nConnected Robotics and Autonomous Systems (CRAS)\nCRAS is required\
    \ to improve industrialization through the use of robots\nand autonomous systems\
    \ for industrial operations. They require a high\nrate and reliability and low\

    \ between the brain and electronic devices.\nThis requires ultra-low latency,\
    \ high reliability, and high data rate.\nDigital Replica\nThese are also called\
    \ digital twins, and they create a digital copy to\nreplace people, places, systems,\
    \ objects. This requires a very high data\nrate, which 6G will enable.\nThis table\
    \ acts as a guide for the applications considered in this section. The brief descriptions\
    \ are highlighted to give the reader a\nbackground knowledge of the applications,\
    \ which would be expatiated as the section progresses.\n6.1. Holographic Communication\n\
    Holography utilizes a laser beam to produce images. This concept has been used\
    \ in\ncolor motion holography [234], metasurface holography [235], 3D holographic\
    \ display [236],\nand holographic type communication (HTC) [237,238]. New 5G enabled\
    \ disruptive tech-\nnology is used in persuasion for real-time holograms [239].\
    \ An exciting feature of 5G\ntechnology is hologram generation and delivery [240].\
    \ Timing synchronization setting for\ntransmission jitter of less than a microsecond\
    \ is required in multi-stream holographic appli-\ncations. More reliable remote\
    \ surgery needs latency of less than 1ms, which is extremely\ndifﬁcult to achieve\
    \ in the current 5G systems [6,241]. Although some promising results\nhave been\
    \ discovered in 5G research, 1Gbps was achieved over a 6.5 km distance, giving\
    \ a\nworld record [233]. This has been experimented with in the 26 GHz range.\
    \ However, this is\nstill way below the requirements needed to enable full holographic\
    \ support in the order\nof 1Tbps [39]. Therefore, the major challenge with holographic\
    \ communication is high\ndata-rate and low latency [10]. To achieve seamless holographic\
    \ communication, extremely\nhigh data transmission, hundreds of times more than\
    \ what is obtainable in 5G systems,\nis required [8].\nWith 6G wireless networks\
    \ proposed to have a data rate in the order of 1Tbps and\nultra-low or non-existing\
    \ latency, holographic communication will cease to be just a utopian\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 1709\n29 of 58\ntechnology limited to movies. As we go higher in the\
    \ frequency spectrum, and with tech-\nnologies such as VLC and more, higher data\
    \ rates would be achieved. A truly ubiquitous\nenvironment empowered by real-time\
    \ holograms could make smart devices appear like\nhorse carriages. Peak data rates\
    \ would reach Tbit/s in the 2030s, which will require mas-\nsive bandwidths availability.\
    \ The huge data rate would enable 16K video resolution in\n360 degrees with a\
    \ refresh rate of 240 Hz required for holographic displays [242]. 6G is\nexpected\
    \ to meet these requirements to support the massive transmission of real-time\
    \ data\nover the air. Furthermore, 6G-empowered XR technologies and holograms\
    \ supported by\nadvanced AI techniques would help clear the time and space barriers\
    \ to advance remote\nsurgery [240].\nMicrosoft developed Holo Lens, and this has\
    \ stirred more research interests in this ﬁeld.\nProjects such as Holoportation,\
    \ Ada, and many more, cutting across engineering, commerce,\ngames, etc. Spatial,\
    \ a virtual communication application that uses Microsoft Holo Lens 2.\nThis allows\
    \ workers in different locations to communicate using avatars or holographic\n\
    shapes of themselves. An effective holographic video conferencing enhances the\
    \ borderless\nworkplace experience where people can work from home. The holographic\
    \ display has\nalso been primarily embraced in recent times. The holographic display\
    \ market is projected\nto reach USD 3576 million by 2020 from USD 567 million\
    \ in 2013 [243], USD 7.6 billion in\n2023, and projected to nearly USD 1 trillion\
    \ in 2030.\n6.2. Teleoperated Driving\n6G is proposed to increase the functionality\
    \ of Autonomous Driving. There is inter-\nest in teleoperated driving (or semi-autonomous\
    \ vehicles) where a human controls the\nvehicle remotely. Teleoperated driving\
    \ has been used in deep-sea and space exploration.\nCompanies such as Ericsson\
    \ and Huawei have tested teleoperation on 5G networks [244].\nTeleoperated driving\
    \ will require ultra-low latency that communicates signals and in-\nstructions\
    \ between the driver and the vehicle, especially in the face of danger where an\n\
    immediate response is needed. This, if achieved optimally, will enhance car-rental\
    \ ser-\nvices of the future. A high level of security, privacy, and network integrity\
    \ is also desired.\nAlthough research is towards fully autonomous vehicles, teleoperation\
    \ is desired when au-\ntonomous mode fails or a complicated scenario requires\
    \ human intervention. Autonomous\nvehicles are being considered under the scope\
    \ of the emerging 5G [245]. However, the 5G\nat its current development state\
    \ cannot meet the actual requirements of a fully developed\n5G wireless network.\
    \ Thus, the need for 6G wireless network development.\n6.3. Tactile Internet\n\
    Tactile internet enables haptic interaction with machines, giving rise to visual\
    \ feedback\nand robotic control. This facilitates efﬁcient human-to-machine interaction,\
    \ machine-to-\nmachine interaction, with key examples found in industry, robotics\
    \ and telepresence,\nvirtual reality, augmented reality, healthcare, road trafﬁc,\
    \ education and culture, and smart\ngrid [246]. This technology is useful where\
    \ human presence is needed to carry out a\ntask [39]. A valuable application of\
    \ tactile internet is in telesurgery, allowing surgeons\nto perform surgery remotely\
    \ [247]. The major challenge with tactile internet is having a\nseamless network\
    \ and a delay that humans do not perceive. To achieve this, low latency of\n1\
    \ ms is required- this is the primary requirement for tactile internet. This was\
    \ projected to\nbe achievable in 5G. However, tests have shown existing 5G networks\
    \ to have a latency\nof 10–16 ms. Therefore, it is expected that 6G wireless networks,\
    \ which are proposed to\nhave a latency of less than 1ms, will enable tactile\
    \ internet and haptic communication.\nAdditionally, precision with very high accuracy\
    \ is desirable [164] and will be facilitated by\n6G. Another desirable feature\
    \ of tactile internet is security; blockchain, a proposed enabling\ntechnology\
    \ for 6G, has been proposed to allow for a trusted, secured, and reliable tactile\n\
    internet architecture [217].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n30 of 58\n6.4. Internet\
    \ of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT)\nResearch advances in nanotechnology and communication\
    \ engineering have engen-\ndered embedded computing devices based on graphene\
    \ and metamaterials. Although\nartiﬁcial materials (i.e., synthesized materials,\
    \ electronic circuits, etc.) have been devel-\noped, a more biological application\
    \ is preferred using biological cells and interfacing the\nbio-chemical interaction\
    \ with the electrical domain. This is to lower the risk of exposure to\ntoxicity\
    \ associated with artiﬁcial devices. These devices can perform intra-body sensing,\n\
    actuation, processing, and networking with a small size and implanted. They have\
    \ a low\ndata-storage capacity and low transmission range [39]. The Internet of\
    \ Bio-Nano Things is\nproposed to be applied in health care, military, and security\
    \ ﬁelds [248]. The authors in [31]\nidentiﬁed IoBNT to aid early diagnosis of\
    \ diseases, especially in the face of the COVID-19\npandemic. However, doubts\
    \ that this technology might not be ripe enough for 6G have\nbeen identiﬁed [31].\n\
    Nevertheless, it will play a crucial role in future wireless networks. To enable\
    \ this,\nchallenges associated with IoBNT need to be resolved. Embedding with\
    \ molecular commu-\nnication (MC) is proposed to improve the range of transmission\
    \ [248]. However, challenges\nexist in the design and development of nanodevices\
    \ and coordination of molecular com-\nmunication in nanodevices [249]. Additionally,\
    \ there are challenges with the security and\nbioethics of this technology [248].\
    \ Furthermore, challenges with modeling the peculiar\nnon-linear biological environment\
    \ exists.\n6.5. Industry 4.0 and Beyond\nThe fourth industrial revolution, also\
    \ tagged Industry 4.0, is expected to enhance the\ncomputerization obtained in\
    \ the third industrial revolution. Although 5G initiated Industry\n4.0, 6G is\
    \ expected to facilitate its full actualization. A combination of cyber-physical\n\
    activities, IoT and IIoT, cloud computing, and AI will make Industry 4.0 achievable\
    \ [250].\nSome technologies that will transform Industry 4.0 are Big Data and\
    \ Analytics, Autonomous\nRobots, IIoT, Cybersecurity, AR, Cloud, and more. High-precision\
    \ manufacturing is vital\nto the actualization of Industry 4.0 [6], as it minimizes\
    \ human intervention with no trade-\noff to accuracy. This requires high reliability\
    \ and extremely low latency; mMTTC and\nURLLC, which will be improved in 6G, makes\
    \ the actualization of this possible. Industry\nX.0 was introduced in [31] as\
    \ a succession to Industry 4.0, and 6G sets a foundation\nupon which this would\
    \ be built. The role of big data [251] and biology [252] in industry\n5.0 has\
    \ been investigated. Industry 5.0 is proposed to be user-centric and personalized\n\
    service-oriented [39].\n6.6. Multisensory XR Applications\nExtended reality (XR)\
    \ is a term that combines VR, AR, and MR (mixed reality) [253].\nIt takes application\
    \ in medicine, education, entertainment, and other ﬁelds of life. Research\nis\
    \ progressing towards the actualization of full Immersive XR. A new concept of\
    \ Quality\nof Physical Experience (QoPE) that merges human factors from the user\
    \ with classical\nQoS and QoE was presented by the authors [47]. This facilitates\
    \ the multisensory feature\ndesired for a more user-centric experience. The main\
    \ challenge, which was also pointed\nout in [8], is inadequate hardware capability\
    \ and insufﬁcient wireless capacity. Table 16\ncompares the AR, VR, and MR, which\
    \ make up XR.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n31 of 58\nTable 16. Comparing AR, VR, and\

    6.7. Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Services (DLS)\nBlockchain has been identiﬁed\
    \ earlier as one of the enabling technologies for the\nactualization of 6G. 6G\
    \ also provides an enhanced blend of massive machine type commu-\nnication (mMTC)\
    \ and URLLC [255]. The reliable connectivity and ultra-low latency ensure\nthe\
    \ efﬁcient running of DLS, thereby making the relationship symbiotic [47]. Blockchain\
    \ in\n5G and beyond has been explored in [256] to enable emerging mobile services.\n\
    6.8. Connected Robotics and Autonomous Systems (CRAS)\nThe CRAS concept was proposed\
    \ as an application of 6G in [47,48]. CRAS is being\ndeveloped, and systems such\
    \ as autonomous cars, drone-delivery systems are gaining\ntraction. This is applied\
    \ in manufacturing and industrialization processes. CRAS requires\nhigh reliability,\
    \ ultra-low latency, and high data rate that existing 5G networks cannot\nprovide\
    \ at this stage of development. 6G networks are expected to meet these needs.\n\
    6.9. Wireless Brain–Computer Interaction (BCI)\nWireless Brain–Computer Interaction\
    \ (BCI) devices help support, enhance and gen-\nerally improve human functions\
    \ [257]. This is mostly used in health care to aid people\nwith severe motor disabilities\
    \ [258]. This requires ultra-low latency and perceptual services\nthat 6G is expected\
    \ to provide. This is especially very important in non-visual BCI for\nthe visually\
    \ impaired, which requires immediate reactions. Existing BCI systems are also\n\
    not reliable enough to be deployed in accuracy-critical applications; the high-reliability\n\
    6G provides ameliorates this. Wireless BCI is more comfortable to use than the\
    \ wired\nBCI thanks to the ﬂexibility of use- users can move while using them\
    \ [259]. They also\nhave simpler connections. However, vibration and interferences\
    \ from moving around are\nchallenges that have to be overcome in wireless BCI\
    \ [260].\n6.10. Digital Replica\nDigital replica, also referred to as digital\
    \ twin [261] and physical twin [262], give a\nvirtual duplicate of people, objects,\
    \ places using sensors, AI, and communication tech-\nnologies [8]. This has been\
    \ adapted to mimic systems. It has been proposed to enable\nvirtualization of\
    \ a cyber-physical system, where safety and security analysis can be carried\n\
    out without disrupting the live feed [261]. It supports an adaptive wireless protocol\
    \ and\nprovides hardware support to drop packets [263]. Users will be able to\
    \ interact with digital\nreplica through holographic display and VR devices. This\
    \ paper proposes applying digital\nreplica in tourism to have a remote experience\
    \ of their desired tourist destinations. Other\ndesirable applications are surgery\
    \ and education; surgeons will create digital replicas of\norgans and perform\
    \ surgery simulations. This is also good for teaching young surgeons.\nDigital\
    \ twin systems have also been proposed to enhance business performance [264].\n\
    AI has been proposed to form a self-sustaining system with the digital replica\
    \ [8]. Quan-\ntum optic communication has also been proposed as a key enabling\
    \ technology for the\nactualization of the digital replica [26]. Digital replica\
    \ is one of the new applications not in\nthe context of 5G, proposed to be enabled\
    \ by 6G; further research is required in this ﬁeld.\nThe applications mentioned\
    \ above, the 5G limitations, and how 6G wireless networks\nwill enable them are\
    \ highlighted in Table 17.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n32 of 58\nTable 17. Comparative\

    It was shown in the preceding Section 6 the different applications such as holographic\n\
    communication, tactile internet, multisensory XR applications, connected robotic\
    \ and\nautonomous systems, and more. These applications open up new spheres that\
    \ contribute\nto the actualization of new cases. Several use cases have been presented\
    \ by researchers in\nthe past, such as in manufacturing and health [10]. This\
    \ paper broaches discussions on\nsome use cases in Agriculture, Education, Media\
    \ and Entertainment, Tourism, Transport\nand Logistics which have no signiﬁcant\
    \ focus. With 6G promising very high data rates,\nultra-low latency, high reliability,\
    \ and more, these use cases will become a reality. In this\nsection, we delineate\
    \ the proposed use cases.\n7.1. Use Cases in Agriculture\nIt has been projected\
    \ that, by the year 2050, current agricultural production must\nincrease by 60–70%\
    \ [274] to cater to the needs of the entire population; to achieve this, the\n\
    pervasive use of high precision wireless technology will play a huge role [274].\
    \ Some use\ncases are autonomous vehicles, AR for training purposes, sensors for\
    \ tracking variables\non the farm, and data. Another application of precision\
    \ agriculture, as suggested by [275],\nis automated irrigation control. Precision\
    \ agriculture, also known as smart farming, will\nfacilitate these by utilizing\
    \ wireless sensor networks to monitor the farm variables and\nmake intelligent\
    \ controls. The stages of precision agriculture identiﬁed in [274] are: (i) data\n\
    collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data analysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld operation\
    \ and evaluation.\nThis presents an opportunity to carry out farm operations more\
    \ efﬁciently. The infusion of\nAI in precision energy has been proposed to improve\
    \ efﬁciency on farms.\nThe application of IoT in the agricultural supply chain\
    \ was also presented in [276].\nSome other use cases of precision agriculture\
    \ have been developed over the years [277,278].\nA challenge identiﬁed with precision\
    \ agriculture using wireless technology is the topology,\nmaking wireless signals\
    \ susceptible to attenuation. This challenge can be eliminated with\nthe use of\
    \ IRS proposed in 6G networks. This allows deployment in non-line-of-sight envi-\n\
    ronments, and it is more efﬁcient than using relays. There are also challenges\
    \ with routing\nprotocols and energy-efﬁcient devices. The authors in [274] reviewed\
    \ several protocols and\nidentiﬁed Zigbee and LoRa wireless protocols as ideal\
    \ for precision agriculture owing to\ntheir low energy requirements. Privacy and\
    \ security are also challenges identiﬁed with\nprecision agriculture [279]. The\
    \ high data rate and reliability and ultra-low latency by 6G\nnetworks will allow\
    \ the optimized actualization of a fully automated farm system, which\nresults\
    \ in a more efﬁcient process, and more output. 6G is also propitious in providing\
    \ a\nmore secure network through blockchain and other security enabling technologies\
    \ treated\nin this paper.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n34 of 58\n7.2. Use Cases in\
    \ Education\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have been forced\
    \ to adopt an\nonline training mode. There has also been growth in enrollment\
    \ in Massive Open Online\nCourses (MOOC) in recent years, with an estimated global\
    \ enrollment of 110 million in 2019.\nAccording to a survey to understand the\
    \ perspective of teachers in a sample population of\nAR, it was shown that learning\
    \ online can be enhanced by utilizing AR in training [280].\nThe survey also showed\
    \ that AR had not been widely adopted in educational institutions,\nand most have\
    \ had contact with it outside educational institutions. This presents a dearth\n\
    in knowledge acquisition through AR.\nThe use of holographs and XR will help to\
    \ give students a better experience while\nlearning. A good example is the training\
    \ of surgeons, in which XR presents a good platform\nfor training. We propose\
    \ the application of 6G in providing remote access to surgeons\nin the theatre\
    \ room. This widens the reach of consultants in teaching hospitals to reach\n\
    more students remotely and provide professional support to students and doctors\
    \ during\nsurgery. Additionally, the UAV provides mobile ambulance access to the\
    \ network, thereby\nallowing communication during emergencies. To actualize this,\
    \ the Doppler effect from\nmoving the UAV and ambulance will need to be tackled.\
    \ This use case will beneﬁt from\nthe concept of high mobility hotspot introduced\
    \ in [250]. 6G networks have been shown\nto facilitate multi-sensory XR, and holographic\
    \ communication will also optimize this\nexperience. There is the challenge of\
    \ a part of the population not being able to access online\ncourses as a consequence\
    \ of the unavailability of the internet. The ubiquitous feature of 6G\nwill also\
    \ ameliorate this challenge.\n7.3. Use Cases in Media and Entertainment\n5G is\
    \ expected to double annual media revenues in the next ten years to $420 billion\n\
    in 2028 [281], and gaming was posited to be at the forefront of 5G innovation.\
    \ Cloud-based\ngaming, Over-the-Top TV, AR, and VR open up new media applications.\
    \ The challenge with\nAR and VR applications is that they require very low latency\
    \ to make delays imperceptible\nby human users. The ultra-low latency of 6G would\
    \ circumvent these delays. This paper\nproposes tactile internet, XR video games,\
    \ cloud gaming, holographic advertising as some\nof the trends in 6G that will\
    \ facilitate growth in media and entertainment. This not only\nopens up new cases\
    \ in media and entertainment, but it also provides succor to those with\nmedical\
    \ needs [282]. The perceptual experience of haptics and implants will give a new\n\
    sensation different and better than the one currently obtainable. BCI will also\
    \ provide\nthe visually impaired opportunity to experience fully immersive gaming.\
    \ VR has been\nutilized to support the mental health of health care professionals\
    \ during the COVID-19\npandemic. Advertising will have a wider reach through the\
    \ 6G ubiquitous connectivity\nfeature. There is, however, a challenge of producing\
    \ energy-efﬁcient devices that will\nsupport these applications.\n7.4. Use Cases\
    \ in Tourism\nMany hotels have widely adopted hotel automation based on IoT. AR\
    \ use cases are\nalso providential in improving challenges associated with accommodation,\
    \ transportation,\nand catering solutions. A recommender system was proposed in\
    \ [283] to aid tourists’\ndecision-making, and the authors identiﬁed a need for\
    \ high bandwidth wireless network\ninfrastructure for the system to work optimally.\
    \ Smart tourism also presents innovative\nsolutions such as self-guided tours,\
    \ tourist trafﬁc control, remote monitoring, resource\nmanagement [284]. This\
    \ is achievable through the infusion of IoT, cloud computing,\nand AI [285]. The\
    \ authors in [286] presented IoT in personalized hotel rooms, voice-\nbased interaction,\
    \ inventory management, location-based information, and body sensors.\nTourism\
    \ was one of the hardest-hit industries because of the COVID-19 pandemic [287],\n\
    and virtual reality was one of the solutions identiﬁed to help the industry lessen\
    \ the effects\nof the pandemic [288].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n35 of 58\nSome\
    \ tourism companies have already adopted this in virtual tours, booking interfaces,\n\
    and other travel experiences. Tourism, education, marketing are other areas where\
    \ VR and\nAR can be adopted [289]. Digital replica, one of the driving trends\
    \ in 6G, provides tourism\nwith a more interactive experience [290]. For smart\
    \ tourism to be widely adopted, the trust\nof the public is desirable. An IoT-based\
    \ solution that is secured was proposed in [291],\nand the security features 6G\
    \ will bring reinforces this and make the user experience much\nbetter. This paper\
    \ proposes that there will be a virtual remote experience of tourist centers\n\
    through fully immersive XR and holographic communication. This will be facilitated\
    \ by\nfuture wireless networks B5G.\n7.5. Uses Cases in Transportation and Logistics\n\
    Smart Logistics is one of the driving trends towards the actualization of Smart\
    \ Cities,\nand several applications have been identiﬁed [292]. It is propitious\
    \ to providing a better lo-\ngistic architecture for business [293]. IoT is one\
    \ of the backbones of smart logistics [292,294].\nWireless sensor networks also\
    \ provide an opportunity to carry out feasibility analysis\nin logistics [295],\
    \ inventory management against spoilage in perishable foods warehous-\ning [296].\
    \ RIS will be widely used in the warehouse to optimize communication between\n\
    IoT devices. This makes full automation and communication seamless. There is also\
    \ an\nopportunity to reduce fatigue and accidents in the warehouse by using fully\
    \ autonomous\nforklifts. Enhanced communication and repair through VR and AR is\
    \ another viable oppor-\ntunity to be facilitated by 5G, which reduces downtime\
    \ in the warehouse. Remote tracking\nwill also be more comfortable with UAVs and\
    \ CubeSats. This makes the utopian idea of a\nfully connected world become a reality.\
    \ Thankfully, this is happening in our time!\n8. Challenges in 6G: Standardization,\
    \ Design, and Deployment\nDespite the beneﬁts 6G promises, some challenges could\
    \ hamper the actualization\nof these networks. This paper examines the challenges\
    \ of enabling technologies for the\n6G networks in detail and proposes creative\
    \ solutions to circumvent these challenges.\nIt also clariﬁes the psychological\
    \ and health issues associated with network densiﬁcation\nand indoor wireless\
    \ communication that 6G will be built. This paper categorizes the\nchallenges\
    \ based on the enabling technologies stated in Section 5. It also proposes potential\n\

    Some signal processing challenges that currently stand in the way of the full\
    \ actualiza-\ntion of 6G have been identiﬁed in the paper. The challenges are\
    \ delineated in this section,\nconsidering challenges and probable solutions identiﬁed\
    \ by researchers. The challenges\ncan be classiﬁed into Channel Estimation, Hardware\
    \ complexity, and Precoding. Channel\nEstimation challenges associated with RIS\
    \ systems have been treated in this paper, and the\nissue of hardware complexity\
    \ has been raised severally. The paper focuses on precoding in\nthis section.\n\
    Terahertz Precoding\nPrecoding is a useful technique in solving the path-loss\
    \ issue in THz communica-\ntion [202] without increasing the transmit power. Pencil\
    \ beams, which are supported\nby very large-scale array antennas, help to actualize\
    \ this. Precoding is channel adaptive,\nand it processes transmitted signals based\
    \ on the available channel information at the\ntransmitter [202,297]. However,\
    \ there are challenges with precoding. The authors [31] have\nidentiﬁed high power\
    \ consumption as a challenge. Other challenges posited are the beam\nsplit effect\
    \ and path-loss as a result of the increasing distance. Hardware impairments such\n\
    as the non-linearity of power ampliﬁers limit THz precoding performance [12].\n\
    8.2. Social, Psychological, Health, and Commercialization Challenges\nSocial factors\
    \ can make or mar the adoption of technology, and 6G wireless communi-\ncation\
    \ is no exception. As humans, our psychology and environment guide many of our\n\

    \ 5G implementation. It was believed in\nsome quarters that the high-frequency\
    \ spectrum is insidious to health. Some conspiracy\ntheorists went as far as linking\
    \ the 5G network to the proliferation of the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic. In this section,\
    \ we critically examine the social, psychological, and health concerns.\nFurthermore,\
    \ we examine some impending challenges that may sprout up during 6G\ncommercialization,\
    \ and suggestions were made to tackle these challenges. Figure 8 gives a\npictorial\
    \ view of some of these impending issues.\n \nter [202,297]. However, there are\

    \ issues. \nHealth issues\n \nFigure 8. Non-wireless technology-related challenges\
    \ for 6G.\n8.2.1. Social, Psychological, and Health Challenges\nConsidering the\
    \ cost of implementing future wireless networks, it is important to\nconvince\
    \ governments and agencies that it is expedient to implement it. Despite the\n\
    beneﬁts technologies driven by 6G networks present, there have been concerns on\
    \ the\nhealth risks of 5G and 6G, especially considering network densiﬁcation\
    \ and transmitting at\na higher frequency spectrum [12,48]. Although transmitting\
    \ at mmWave, Terahertz, and\nVisible light are at a higher frequency as against\
    \ what is currently obtainable, they belong\nto the non-ionizing range. Although\
    \ there have been concerns on the dangers of 5G [298]\nand scientists, have bemoaned\
    \ and petitioned the WHO about the hazards of 5G, not just\nwith the potency.\
    \ Still, with the pulse, the world would be exposed to [299], the effects of\n\
    Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) have been studied [300], and no adverse health effects\
    \ have\nbeen established.\nThe International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation\
    \ Protection (ICNIRP) has\nrecently updated their exposure guideline to abide\
    \ by mobile operators and telecommu-\nnication companies. The new guideline covers\
    \ higher frequency bands envisaged in 5G\nnetworks and beyond [301]. It is crucial\
    \ to ensure that these guidelines are adhered to.\nMore research is conducted\
    \ to ascertain the effects of higher frequency on humans and\nother organisms\
    \ in the ecosystem and how to assuage the effects. When these issues are\naddressed,\
    \ the social and psychological challenges expected in 5G and beyond will be\n\
    reduced considerably and subsequently expunged.\n8.2.2. Commercialization Challenges\n\
    6G commercialization challenges were keenly discussed at the 6Genesis Flagship\n\
    Program (6GFP) launched in Finland in May 2018. The 6GFP consortium comprises\n\
    academia, research centers, institutes, industrial and business partners, and\
    \ coordinated\nby the University of Oulu in Finland. The program is the ﬁrst to\
    \ focus on 6G research\nglobally [302]. The Director of the 6G ﬂagship, Matti\
    \ Latva-aho, noted that 6G would be\ndeployed around 2030 to meet the expectations\
    \ not provided by 5G, alongside the new\nones fusing AI-inspired applications\
    \ in every ﬁeld of society with ubiquitous wireless\nconnectivity. The estimated\
    \ cost of the 6G ﬂagship will be around EUR 250 million over\neight years.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 1709\n38 of 58\nThere has been limited literature on the potential\
    \ commercialization challenges of\n6G. Although the deployment of 6G is expected\
    \ to commence in 2030 [26], it is prudent\nto foresee the challenges associated\
    \ with commercialization to prevent or circumvent\nthese challenges. 6G networks\
    \ are proposed to facilitate ubiquitous connectivity, even in\nrural communities.\
    \ Rural areas have the challenge of lack of revenue per square mile to\naccommodate\
    \ the enormous cost of 6G deployment. One question posed at the ﬁrst 6G\nsummit\
    \ by Tarik Taleb is if autonomous companies would be willing to pay for the cost\n\
    of connectivity to have access to this technology. Will smart factories need operators\
    \ for\ntheir networks? Will the training costs to adapt to the new networks be\
    \ worth the money?\nThese are some of the questions that need to be answered from\
    \ a business perspective. 5G\ndeployment is posed with the challenge of cost,\
    \ which is envisaged in 6G deployment.\nThe use of UAVs and advanced radio techniques,\
    \ exploitation of solar-powered energy-\nefﬁcient devices, reusability of network\
    \ components and functions, and deployment of\ncommodity hardware were identiﬁed\
    \ as some of the pillars to actualize connectivity in\nrural areas [89]. However,\
    \ this was based on the premise that internet connectivity will\nbe a primary\
    \ need that the government or government-based entities may provide, but\nnot\
    \ private entities. This presents an uncertainty on who will bear the cost of\
    \ deployment.\nInterference of government policies was witnessed in the 5G deployment.\
    \ It is not yet\nclear enough if 6G networks will be fully supported by the infrastructure\
    \ of pre-existing\ngenerations, especially 5G, or there will be a total overhaul\
    \ of infrastructure. Nevertheless, it\nis essential to note that the existing\
    \ tower infrastructure is unsustainable, and the complete\nactualization of 5G\
    \ and subsequently 6G will present a more sustainable business model.\nAlthough\
    \ the mmWave was presented as the enabling spectrum for 5G, early de-\nployment\
    \ of 5G has been on the sub-6GHz spectrum. Early 6G deployment may not be\ndeployed\
    \ on THz immediately at the point of deployment. The early adoption of sub-6GHz\n\
    in 6G was suggested in [250]. It is, therefore, pertinent to maximize the sub-6GHz\
    \ spectrum.\nThe adoption of a wireless generation is driven by the services provided\
    \ and not just the\nenabling technologies. Although some use cases of 6G have\
    \ been proposed in this paper,\nthe onus is on the users to adopt these services.\
    \ If users are reluctant to adopt these use\ncases, though highly unlikely, it\
    \ presents a dent in the expected fast adoption of 6G. In all,\nthere is a need\
    \ for investment in 6G research and its subsequent deployment.\n9. 6G Sustainability\
    \ and Business Model\nIn this section, we discuss 6G sustainability and business\
    \ model. First, we present\na brief discussion in Section 9.1 on the multi-faceted\
    \ communication capabilities of 6G\nthat will contribute signiﬁcantly to global\
    \ sustainability and offering massive support for\nvarious services to promote\
    \ healthy and economic stability. Next, we describe how 6G will\nbring about a\
    \ dramatic change in the business arena in Section 9.2.\n9.1. 6G Sustainability\n\
    The 5G networks have drastically resolved several social issues inherent in 4G\
    \ wireless\nnetworks. For example, environmental protection and education have\
    \ received remarkable\nimprovements in the 5G era. However, the problems of connectivity\
    \ and urbanization\nremain. No doubt, 6G will usher in a great sigh of relief.\
    \ User-experienced-based hyperdata\nconnectivity will be ubiquitous and regional\
    \ barriers will be broken to achieve a truly bor-\nderless society [47,302]. The\
    \ multi-faceted communication capabilities of 6G will contribute\nimmensely to\
    \ global sustainability and offer massive support for various services at the\n\
    application layer [303]. This will, in turn, accelerates smart farming, access\
    \ to ﬁnancial\nservices, and facilitates online healthcare delivery. In terms\
    \ of energy conservation, 6G\nwill aid electronic circuit miniaturization and\
    \ empower extra large-scale integration of\ncomponents to reduce carbon footprint.\
    \ However, achieving the Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs); data security\
    \ and inclusiveness, will come at a price. All parties involved;\ngovernment agencies,\
    \ hospitals, and society, must meet strict privacy rules to promote\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 1709\n39 of 58\nthe integrity of the system. 6G will provide digital infrastructure\
    \ to address the needs of\nhumans and society.\n6G will also enable context-aware\
    \ environment sensing and indoor localization to aid\nonline monitoring and support\
    \ the massive uplifting of the SDGs ecosystem. A summary\nof the set of KPIs for\
    \ all 17 SDGs, including probable use cases, is presented in [303].\nTo provide\
    \ viable solutions to the vast sustainability problems, the 6G research community\n\
    needs to closely examine the open ecosystem-based value conﬁguration and decentralized\n\
    poly-nodal power conﬁguration [304,305]. 6G will be the foci point between nanotech-\n\
    nology, biotechnology, cognitive science, and ICT. Ultimately, this will increase\
    \ societal\nrequirements; resilience, sustainability, transparency, and inclusivity,\
    \ leading to a complex\nsocietal mix [306,307]. Additionally, 6G will provide\
    \ an atmosphere of productivity and\nrapid economic growth in rural and urban\
    \ geographies towards achieving the UN sustain-\nability goals, especially goals\
    \ 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable\nCities and Communities),\
    \ amongst others.\n9.2. 6G Business Model\nGiven the recent global ﬁnancial crisis,\
    \ there is no denying the fact that the existing\ncorporate business models had\
    \ a signiﬁcant impact on the sustainability of the global\neconomy and society\
    \ [308–310]. This is a wake-up call for all companies to regulate their\noperations\
    \ geared towards achieving the UN SDGs [303]. The business scenarios for 6G\n\
    in the next ten years are envisioned as highly prosperous [302]. Blockchain-empowered\n\
    decentralized resource conﬁguration techniques have been proposed to support several\n\
    verticals and business platforms in the prospective 6G wireless network [303].\
    \ The probable\nmarket trends and uncertainties are elaborated and three scenarios\
    \ identiﬁed by Ziegler\nand Yrjola [311]. These include user experience, sustainability,\
    \ and business. Scalability and\nsustainability are proposed to be critical drivers\
    \ for future 6G business models [312,313].\n6G will bring about a dramatic change\
    \ in the business arena. The future of busi-\nness will be characterized by a\
    \ seamless and automated collection of market data from\nhumans and the dynamic\
    \ business environment. 6G will provide a user-friendly plat-\nform for intelligent\
    \ analysis of big data for high-end products and specialized services.\nThese\
    \ products and services would be designed to be highly sustainable and well-tailored\n\
    to address the peculiar needs of the consumers in rural and urban geographies.\
    \ Addition-\nally, 6G will aid crowdsourcing and enhance cutting-edge distribution\
    \ platforms to support\nsharing sustainable business models to accelerate the\
    \ equitable distribution of resources.\nRecently, the choices for developing the\
    \ ﬁrst-class sustainable 6G business future for all the\nparticipants in the future\
    \ 6G business were recapitulated by [307]. These useful choices\nfor creating\
    \ the favorite sustainable 6G business futures have been designed using the\n\
    quintuple helix model shown in Figure 9. Sustainable 6G business is key to knowledge\n\

    \ We conclude the paper with a\nsummary of key take-away lessons for further research\
    \ and development in 6G wireless\ncommunication.\n10.1. Recent Trends\nChina launched\
    \ the ﬁrst 6G satellite to space in November 2020. The satellite uses\nhigh-frequency\
    \ terahertz waves for data transmission. Although the launch is just a trial,\n\
    and it is not sure if it will be in the ﬁnal 6G standard, this has ushered in\
    \ the 3D architecture\nof terrestrial, space, and underwater communication, kick-starting\
    \ transmission on space.\nThere is an ongoing development of 6D Holographic optical\
    \ ﬁeld technology. This will be\nenabled by the exigent speciﬁcations of higher\
    \ data rate and low latency to be facilitated by\n6G. This technology presents\
    \ a new and desirable user experience in media and entertain-\nment. Security\
    \ has been identiﬁed as a challenge in the adoption of the Internet of Bio-Nano\n\
    Things. The authors in [249] proposed a biocyber interface-based privacy scheme.\
    \ The pri-\nvacy scheme worked on top of the biocyber interface in the IoBNT model\
    \ and showed\npromising results with minimal side effects. Research in autonomous\
    \ driving is progressing,\nand driverless buses and taxis are expected on Britain’s\
    \ roads as of 2021 [314]. As explained\nearlier in this paper, the psychological\
    \ trust of the population is desirable for the seamless\nadoption of this technology.\
    \ Considering Terahertz transmission, spatial modulation [315]\nhas been proposed\
    \ to minimize the hardware impairments [316]. The development of\nWireless Network\
    \ on Chip (WNoC) enabled by miniaturized transceivers and antenna is\nalso gaining\
    \ traction [189]. We believe these trends and developments draw us closer to\n\
    the realization of 6G wireless communication systems.\n10.2. Future Research Directions\n\
    Pervasive AI is crucial in actualizing intelligent future wireless networks. However,\n\
    there is a challenge of having energy-efﬁcient hardware at the mobile unit, allowing\n\
    users to experience high-speed applications such as extended reality, fully autonomous\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 1709\n41 of 58\nsystems, and more. Therefore, further research\
    \ is needed to produce hardware that will\nbe compatible with 6G. These devices\
    \ are desired to be energy efﬁcient. This keeps in\nplay the vision to have longer\
    \ battery life. Security and trust of wireless networks is\nalso an issue which\
    \ 6G is expected to combat. There is a need for more research on\nquantum communication.\
    \ As stated earlier in this paper, technologies such as Quantum\ncommunication,\
    \ Internet of Bio-Nano Things might not be mature enough to enable\n6G. Still,\
    \ they will be key future wireless networks. Quantum communication not only\n\
    improves security but also improves computational efﬁciency. Space communication\n\
    has been explored in this paper. If this is incorporated with terrestrial and\
    \ underwater\ncommunication, the vision of a true ubiquitous communication network\
    \ will be achieved.\nSaeed et al. [182] envisage the CubeSats to facilitate future\
    \ wireless communication in space\nthanks to their low cost and low orbital altitude.\
    \ However, we have identiﬁed challenges\nin the channel model which need urgent\
    \ research focus. Future research prospects in\nsoftware-deﬁned networking, Internet\
    \ of Space Things, and Machine Learning resource\nallocation for CubeSats have\
    \ been identiﬁed. Table 19 considers these open research issues\non underwater\
    \ communication, security, channel estimation, and more detail.\nTable 19. 6G\
    \ related open research issues that require further investigation.\nOpen Research\
    \ Issues\nResearch Directions\nChannel Estimation\nThe use of spatial correlation\
    \ [317], Low-Complexity Channel Estimation [318], Comprehensive\nsensing technique\
    \ [319], Deep Learning-based technique [320], and more, in the context of 5G,\n\
    can be adapted to resolve the Channel Estimation challenges in 6G.\nSecurity\n\
    Quantum communication has been highlighted to improve the security and privacy\
    \ of wireless\nnetworks [88]. Access control and authentication challenges in\
    \ blockchain need to be resolved.\nFurther research on molecular communication\
    \ security, which utilizes biochemical signals to\ntransmit information, is required\
    \ [321].\nUnderwater Communication\nThe underwater optical communication system\
    \ (UOWC) [322], similar to VLC, application of\nacoustic signals requires further\
    \ research to resolve the limited short-range problem. The need to\nintegrate\
    \ aerial, terrestrial and underwater communication is imperative. Further, the\
    \ need for\ncutting-edge networking protocols to accelerate this integration is\
    \ not negotiable.\nEnergy Efﬁciency\nThere are tradeoffs with hardware complexity\
    \ and energy requirements. However, sustainable\nand efﬁcient energy harvesting\
    \ sources can also be explored [323] to limit carbon emission [324].\n5G New radio\
    \ was designed to aid energy efﬁciency in 5G. However, the current 5G networks\n\
    consume more power than 4G networks [1]. Therefore, research is needed to reduce\
    \ the\nsoftwarization cost in the existing 5G networks towards 6G.\nSpectral Efﬁciency\n\
    6G is expected to leverage on higher spectrums: subTerahertz, Terahertz, optical\
    \ frequency, and\nmore. In 5G, Cognitive Radio (CR) improves the SE through dynamic\
    \ spectrum sharing [325].\nHowever, there exists a challenge in heterogeneous\
    \ networks (HetNets) with varying nodes [326].\nA blockchain-based system for\
    \ network sharing is envisioned [327]. These and other\nresource-sharing options\
    \ such as FlexRAN and LayBack need further research focus [328].\nHardware Complexity\n\
    Considering the RIS and THz for 6G, the physical layer is expected to get more\
    \ complicated, and\nthis poses severe challenges to hardware design for THz communication.\
    \ The appropriate\ncommunication systems and networking protocols that aid compatibility\
    \ need further research.\nFurther research is required on the scalability of Wireless\
    \ Network on Chip (WiNoC) models to\nsustain transmission at THz over a long distance\
    \ [329].\nSaad et al. [47] opined that there would be a shift from smart phones-base\
    \ station\nparadigm to smart surface–human embedded implants. They also proposed\

    \ Learned\nIn this section, we have identiﬁed and summarized lessons learned from\
    \ this research\nwork. We believe these lessons are crucial and will guide researchers\
    \ on progressing 6G\nresearch.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n43 of 58\nLesson 1: Comparing\
    \ the Key Technologies that will facilitate the actualization\nof 6G.\nIt has\
    \ been established that Terahertz communication and VLC will give a higher\ndata\
    \ rate than the one obtainable in 5G networks. Cell-free massive MIMO presents\
    \ a new\nconcept that eliminates cells in communication and improves user experience.\
    \ UAVs and\nCubeSats, which form the Internet of Space Things introduced in [37],\
    \ and underwater\ncommunication will play a huge role in achieving ubiquitous\
    \ connectivity. Challenges with\neach technology have also been identiﬁed in this\
    \ article. It has also been established that\nquantum communication and blockchain\
    \ will provide secure future wireless networks.\nAmbient backscatter communication\
    \ will also play a huge role in energy and spectral\nefﬁciency. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ will be pervasively adopted to enable intelligent networks,\nmaking them self-efﬁcient.\
    \ Deep Learning has been proposed as an alternative to existing\nalgorithms for\
    \ modeling channel information. However, despite the high processing power\nthat\
    \ has expanded AI development in recent times, data are still cumbersome. We propose\n\
    Big Data to play a crucial role in managing the large amount of data associated\
    \ with\nwireless networks.\nLesson 2: 5G is limited, and 6G is proposed to provide\
    \ requirements that will be\ncompatible with emerging applications and services.\n\
    Current 5G systems do not have the bandwidth to support a fully immersive XR\n\
    experience and high deﬁnition holographic communication. Applications such as\
    \ Tactile\nInternet, Wireless Brain–Computer Interface also require high reliability\
    \ and ultra-low\nlatency, which 5G cannot provide. Additionally, needed is a very\
    \ high data rate in the\norder of 1Tbps with a latency <1 ms, making delay imperceptible\
    \ to humans. These will be\nprovided by 6G. Achieving this enables new use cases\
    \ in agriculture, education, media and\nentertainment, tourism, and logistics.\
    \ Additionally, it has been established that the sub-\n6GHz band is crowded. There\
    \ are research interests in TeraHertz spectrum communication.\nThis will provide\
    \ a new spectrum and enable higher data rates, which are desirable in 6G.\nOptical\
    \ Wireless Technology such as Visible Light Communication and Free Space Optics\n\
    also need to be explored.\nLesson 3: Compatibility at the hardware level is still\
    \ a major challenge as many UE\nare currently not 6G compatible.\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ is proposed to enable wireless networks to be intelligent entities.\nHowever,\
    \ this casts a toll on the energy requirement at the mobile unit, as high processing\n\
    power is required to process a large amount of data and the AI algorithms. Additionally,\n\
    there is a need for new chips for TeraHertz communication. Wireless Network on\
    \ Chip\n(WNoC) has been introduced in [189], but further research needs to be\
    \ done to check its\npracticability. There is a need to have energy-efﬁcient devices\
    \ that support the driving\ntrends in 6G. There is also a need for new protocols\
    \ or updates of existing protocols to\nenable communication in 6G networks. In\
    \ all, the hardware and protocols need to be\ncost-efﬁcient to aid easy commercialization.\n\
    Lesson 4: Will there be a complete overhaul of the backhaul of present wireless\
    \ net-\nworks, or will there be new Infrastructure? Not certain.\nIt is not yet\
    \ clear if there will be a complete overhaul of existing wireless networks\nwith\
    \ a new architecture for 6G. However, there will undoubtedly be a need for more\n\
    infrastructure, especially RIS, UAVs, CubeSats, which are yet to be widely adopted.\
    \ Massive\nMIMO previously deployed in 5G will be further explored to incorporate\
    \ a cell-free massive\ncommunication network. A 3D network architecture that combines\
    \ satellite, UAV, and\nterrestrial networks is proposed to facilitate ubiquitous\
    \ communication. This will bring\nabout space and terrestrial communication. It\
    \ is also crucial to incorporate underwater\ncommunication. It is worthy to note\
    \ at this juncture that it will be desirable to incorporate\nthe existing architecture,\
    \ especially those of the recently commercialized 5G. This enables a\nnetwork\
    \ that is not just performance efﬁcient but cost-efﬁcient.\nLesson 5: 3CS (Communication,\
    \ Computing, Control).\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n44 of 58\n6G has been proposed\
    \ to be a multi-purpose system that combines communication,\ncomputing, control,\
    \ and localization [47]. The authors in [6,331] went further to include\ncaching.\
    \ The combination of communication, computing, and control is an aberration from\n\
    what is obtainable in existing generations where the focus was solely on wireless\
    \ commu-\nnication. However, challenges such as enabling intelligent control in\
    \ stringent applications\nsuch as autonomous vehicles, multi-modal fusion for\
    \ 3D image reconstructing [47], and\nlack of prior models exist. Quantum communication\
    \ is proposed to play a key role in\nimproving the speed and performance of computational\
    \ processes. The actualization of\nthese will facilitate CRAS, XR, and more applications\n\
    Lesson 6: Haptics will be more prominent.\nHaptics present a form of communication\
    \ using touch. Haptic devices have a unique\nbi-directionality feature that allows\
    \ them to communicate with the brain, i.e., bi-directional\ncommunication with\
    \ the brain. Teletouch facilitated by Haptics technology will remake\nthe internet\
    \ into allowing users to move distant objects and experiencing instant tactile\n\
    feedback. Upon the wide adoption of haptics, it has been proposed to be the end\
    \ of the\nsmartphone era [47], a new era of wearables and haptics will be ushered\
    \ in. Applications\nsuch as multisensory extended reality, BCI will also fuel\
    \ this transition. However, for these\ntechnologies to be widely adopted, the\
    \ psychological concerns of the users will need to be\nresolved.\nLesson 7: Industry\
    \ 4.0 will be facilitated by CRAS, smart logistics, precision agricul-\nture,\
    \ smart cities.\nThere will be a pervasive application of AI and automated control\
    \ systems. This will\nopen up applications such as CRAS that will improve industrial\
    \ processes and products\neffectively. Industry 5.0 will be more user-centric\
    \ with the personalized manufacturing\nprocess. Holographic communication, Multisensory\
    \ XR, Digital Twin, and more will\nfacilitate the actualization of smart cities.\
    \ This will also bring about an upgrade in the\nmedia and entertainment industry.\
    \ There will be a better user experience in online gaming\nthrough extended reality,\
    \ tactile devices, and more. New use cases in smart logistics,\nprecision agriculture,\
    \ and more have been introduced in this paper, and these are expected\nto drive\
    \ massive industrialization. These applications and use cases make the actualization\n\
    of 6G desirable.\nLesson 8: Security, a desirable feature of 6G, will be provided\
    \ by blockchain and\nquantum communication.\nThere are research interests in quantum\
    \ cryptography and quantum machine learning.\nThis is expected to make future\
    \ wireless networks secured. However, quantum communi-\ncation research has not\
    \ received as much attention as other enabling technologies; thus,\ncasting doubts\
    \ on its maturity in 6G deployment. Therefore, there is a need for more\nresearch\
    \ focus on quantum communication. Blockchain is another technology that will\n\
    improve the trust and security of future wireless networks. This is a distributed\
    \ ledger tech-\nnology with decentralized control. Artiﬁcial Intelligence will\
    \ also play a role in detecting\nthreats in wireless networks, thus creating a\
    \ secure and self-sustaining network.\nLesson 9: Need for a new networking protocol.\n\
    There is also a need for new networking protocols or an upgrade to the existing\
    \ ones\nto be compatible with the new technologies such as the THz frequency spectrum,\
    \ which\nare enablers of 6G. As stated earlier in this paper, communicating at\
    \ a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss. Therefore, there is\
    \ a need for hardware to improve the\ntransmission range of THz communication.\
    \ There is also a need for a robust system and\nalgorithm for handover management\
    \ in UAV/CubeSat communication. It is as well crucial\nthat these hardware architectures\
    \ are low-cost and energy-efﬁcient. Additionally, as stated\nearlier, compatibility\
    \ with existing infrastructure is desirable.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1709\n45 of 58\n\
    Lesson 10: Multiplexing methods.\nMultiplexing techniques such as Orthogonal Frequency\
    \ Division Multiplexing (OFDM),\nGeneralized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM),\
    \ Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC),\nSpatial Multiplexing, and more, are proposed\
    \ in 5G. Further research is needed to ascertain\nhow these multiplexing methods\
    \ will be crucial in actualizing the desirable 6G networks.\nSpectrum and infrastructure\
    \ sharing is also desirable to maximize capabilities, and CR\nand Blockchain are\
    \ some of the technologies proposed. Further research is needed to\nachieve this.\
    \ Generally, there is a need for new protocols and standards for 6G to enable\n\
    standardization and compatibility. Additionally, software-deﬁned networking (SDN)\
    \ needs\nto be explored to resolve protocol incompatibility.\nLesson 11: Need\
    \ to provide pragmatic solutions to the vast sustainability problems\nby adopting\
    \ innovative and sustainable business models.\nSustainable business is key to\
    \ knowledge creation to drive human empowerment,\ntechnology acquisition and transfer,\
    \ economic stability, entrepreneurship and innovation,\necological reconstruction,\
    \ and democratization of government institutions. However,\nmost current business\
    \ models are not sustainable. There is a need for adaptive and\ninnovative business\
    \ models to regulate the market forces to achieve global economic\nstability.\
    \ Ultimately, such business models will accelerate productivity and rapid economic\n\
    growth in rural environments towards achieving the UN sustainability goals.\n\
    11. Conclusions\nThis paper attempted to discuss how the 6G wireless network will\
    \ enable cutting-edge\napplications, which the existing 5G has not seamlessly\
    \ facilitated. The enabling technolo-\ngies for 6G wireless networks are discussed\
    \ in detail and contrasted with the existing\n5G technology. The challenges which\
    \ pose as barriers to the actualization of 6G wireless\ncommunication are emphasized.\
    \ The accompanying social, psychological, health, and\ncommercialization challenges\
    \ are discussed. New use cases of 6G in agriculture, education,\nmedia and entertainment,\
    \ tourism, transport, and logistics, are broached. Channel estima-\ntion, security,\
    \ underwater communication, and more require further research to guarantee\nthe\
    \ envisioned ubiquitous connectivity in the 6G era and beyond. The multi-faceted\
    \ 6G\nwireless communication capabilities in accelerating the United Nations Sustainable\
    \ Devel-\nopment Goals to drastically alleviate poverty, promote an equitable\
    \ and fair distribution of\nscarce resources, improve healthcare delivery, and\
    \ maintain global economic stability are\ndiscussed extensively. Finally, we have\
    \ given a concise but more explicit vision of what 6G\nwill be, provide an up-to-date\
    \ review of the emerging trends, assess the potential challenges\nenvisioned in\
    \ 6G wireless network deployment, and stimulate research initiatives to tackle\n\
    these challenges for societal advancement.\nAuthor Contributions: A.L.I. and O.A.\

    \ \nAgriculture and environmental monitoring are \nonly two of the many industries\
    \ that have been \ntransformed by wireless sensor networks \n(WSNs) and the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT). The \nmonitoring and control of vegetation, which is \nessential\
    \ \nfor \nguaranteeing \nfood \nsecurity, \nenvironmental sustainability, and\
    \ ecosystem \nhealth, is one essential application in this field. \nThe creation\
    \ of intelligent systems for real-time \nmonitoring and analysis of vegetation\
    \ has been \nmade possible by the integration of WSNs and \nIoT technologies.\
    \ This has enhanced agricultural \npractises and allowed for timely intervention.\
    \ \nTraditional \nvegetation \nmonitoring \nhas \ndepended on manual observations\
    \ and sporadic \ninspections, which are time-consuming, labor-\nintensive, and\
    \ have a limited capacity to give \nreal-time information. WSNs have become a\
    \ \npotent tool for automatic and continuous \nmonitoring of vegetative characteristics,\
    \ such as \ntemperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light \nintensity, thanks\
    \ to developments in sensor \ntechnologies. WSNs are made up of numerous \ngeographically\
    \ dispersed sensors that work \ntogether to gather and transmit data to a base\
    \ \nstation or central node for additional processing \nand analysis. \nThe demand\
    \ for effective and intelligent \nvegetation monitoring systems has been \npushed\
    \ by the expanding worldwide population \nand the necessity for sustainable agriculture\
    \ \npractises. Traditional methods fall short of the \nrequirements of precision\
    \ agriculture, where \naccurate and timely information about the \nhealth of the\
    \ plants is essential for maximising \nresource allocation and reducing environmental\
    \ \nimpacts. By enabling automated analysis and \ndecision-making based on real-time\
    \ data, the \nintegration of CNNs with WSNs and IoT can \naddress these issues\
    \ and improve agricultural \nproductivity and resource management. The \nNEUROQUANTOLOGY\

    \ \nCNNs \nin \nvegetation \nanalysis, \nthe \nimplementation procedure, the outcomes\
    \ of \nthe experiments, and potential uses and future \nprospects for the suggested\
    \ system. \nII. \nLiterature Review: \nIn this part, we provide an extensive assessment\
    \ \nof published studies on wireless sensor \nnetworks (WSNs), the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), \nand convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as \nthey apply to\
    \ the observation and analysis of \nvegetation. In order to build a solid foundation\
    \ \nfor the proposed study on a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork System for Clever Vegetation-IoT\
    \ \n(WSN-CVIoT) utilising CNNs, the review intends \nto give a comprehensive grasp\
    \ of the present \nstate-of-the-art, identify research gaps, and \nsummarise the\
    \ literature. Numerous studies \nhave emphasised the use of WSNs for \nmonitoring\
    \ vegetation. In order to monitor soil \nmoisture and temperature, Ahmad et al.\
    \ (2018) \npresented a WSN-based system. This showed \nhow well WSNs work at providing\
    \ real-time data \nfor irrigation control. Similar to this, Zhang et al. \n(2017)\
    \ created a WSN system to track a variety \nof environmental factors in agricultural\
    \ areas, \nsuch as temperature, humidity, and light \nintensity, \nto \nenable\
    \ \nprecision \nagriculture \npractises. These studies demonstrate the value \n\
    of WSNs in gathering information on the state \nof the environment and vegetation.\
    \ \nThe ability to monitor vegetation has been \nsignificantly improved by the\
    \ integration of \nWSNs with IoT technologies. An IoT-based \nsystem \nfor \n\
    real-time \nmonitoring \nand \nmanagement of greenhouse settings was \npresented\
    \ by Wang et al. in 2019. The system \nused \nWSNs \nto \ngather \ninformation\
    \ \non \ntemperature, \nhumidity, \nand \nCO2 \nlevels, \nproviding the best possible\
    \ management of \ngreenhouses. WSNs and the Internet of Things \nwere used in\
    \ a different study by Liu et al. \n(2020) to monitor agricultural growth and\
    \ \noptimise resource allocation. These studies \nshow how real-time data collecting,\
    \ analysis, \nand decision-making can enhance vegetation \nmonitoring via IoT.\
    \ In the area of computer \nvision and image analysis, CNNs have attracted \n\
    a lot of interest. CNNs have been effectively \nused for tasks like plant disease\
    \ detection and \nclassification in the context of vegetation \nanalysis. Using\
    \ photos of leaves, Mohanty et al. \n(2016) created a CNN model to identify illnesses\
    \ \nin plants with excellent accuracy. Similar to this, \nKamilaris et al. (2018)\
    \ used CNNs to identify \ncrops and weeds, enabling more precise weed \nmanagement\
    \ methods. These experiments \ndemonstrate how well CNNs do automated \nvegetation\
    \ analysis, allowing for the possibility \nof \ntimely \nand \naccurate \nintervention\
    \ \nin \nagricultural practises. \nTo create intelligent systems for monitoring\
    \ and \nanalysing vegetation, recent research has \nconcentrated on merging WSNs\
    \ with CNNs. An \nintegrated WSN-CNN system for agricultural \ngrowth monitoring\
    \ was proposed by Zhang et \nal. (2019). The system used a CNN model to \nanalyse\
    \ the plant growth stage and WSNs to \ngather \nenvironmental \ndata. \nThe \n\
    study \nillustrated how well the integrated system \nperformed an accurate assessment\
    \ of crop \ngrowth phases. A WSN-CNN-based system for \nidentifying and controlling\

    \                         \n \nwas also created by Li et al. (2020). The \nintegrated\
    \ system allowed for the quick and \naccurate identification of invasive species\
    \ using \nimage analysis. Despite the development of \nWSNs, IoT, and CNNs for\
    \ monitoring vegetation, \nthere are still many research possibilities and \n\
    gaps. First off, scalability and effective energy \nmanagement are necessary for\
    \ the deployment \nof \nWSNs \nin \nlarge-scale \nagricultural \nor \nenvironmental\
    \ \nsettings. \nSecond, \nthe \neffectiveness of intervention efforts can be \n\
    increased by creating domain-specific decision-\nmaking algorithms based on the\
    \ findings of \nvegetation analysis. Additionally, combining \nWSNs and CNNs with\
    \ additional data sources, \nsuch remote sensing and satellite imaging, can \n\
    deliver a more thorough and precise evaluation \nof vegetation health. \nThis\
    \ literature study has shed light on the state-\nof-the-art \nfor \nmonitoring\
    \ \nand \nanalysing \nvegetation using WSNs, IoT, and CNNs. \nAccording to existing\
    \ research, the Internet of \nThings (IoT) and wireless sensor networks \n(WSNs)\
    \ are two interconnected technologies \nthat have revolutionised a number of sectors,\
    \ \nincluding healthcare, agriculture, environmental \nmonitoring, and smart cities.\
    \ While the IoT \nrefers to the network of connected physical \ndevices and systems\
    \ that communicate and \nexchange data, WSNs are made up of numerous \nspatially\
    \ \ndistributed \nsensor \nnodes \nthat \ncooperatively gather and send data.\
    \ \n \nIII. \nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) \nWSNs consist of small, low-cost\
    \ sensor nodes \nequipped \nwith \nsensing, \nprocessing, \nand \ncommunication\
    \ capabilities. These nodes are \ndeployed in the target environment, such as\
    \ \nagricultural fields or industrial settings, to \nmonitor and collect data\
    \ about the physical or \nenvironmental conditions. WSNs offer several \nadvantages,\
    \ including: \na) \nReal-time \nmonitoring: \nWSNs \nenable \ncontinuous and real-time\
    \ monitoring of various \nparameters, such as temperature, humidity, \nlight intensity,\
    \ air quality, and motion. This \nprovides valuable insights into the dynamic\
    \ \nbehavior of the monitored system. \nb) Scalability: WSNs can be easily scaled\
    \ up or \ndown by deploying additional sensor nodes or \nadjusting their spatial\
    \ distribution. This allows \nfor flexible and adaptable monitoring systems \n\
    that can cover large areas or specific regions of \ninterest. \nc) Energy efficiency:\
    \ Sensor nodes in WSNs are \ntypically battery-powered and designed to \noperate\
    \ with minimal energy consumption. \nTechniques such as sleep scheduling, data\
    \ \naggregation, and energy harvesting help extend \nthe network's lifetime. \n\
    d) Data-centric approach: WSNs focus on \ncollecting and transmitting relevant\
    \ data rather \nthan raw sensor readings. Data-centric routing \nalgorithms \n\
    and \ncompression \ntechniques \noptimize data transmission and reduce network\
    \ \ntraffic. \n \nIV. \nInternet of Things (IoT) \nThe IoT refers to a network\
    \ of interconnected \nphysical devices, objects, and systems that \ncommunicate\
    \ with each other and exchange \ndata over the internet. IoT devices can include\
    \ \nsensors, actuators, smart appliances, wearable \ndevices, and more. Key characteristics\
    \ of the IoT \ninclude: \na) Connectivity: IoT devices are equipped with \ncommunication\
    \ capabilities, such as Wi-Fi, \nBluetooth, or cellular connectivity, enabling\
    \ \nthem to connect to the internet and exchange \ndata with other devices and\
    \ cloud-based \nplatforms. \nb) Data sharing and analysis: IoT devices \ngenerate\
    \ a vast amount of data, which can be \nshared and analyzed in real-time. Cloud-based\
    \ \nplatforms and data analytics techniques enable \nthe processing, storage,\
    \ and analysis of IoT-\ngenerated data, leading to actionable insights \nand intelligent\
    \ decision-making. \nc) \nInteroperability: \nThe \nIoT \necosystem \ncomprises\
    \ devices from different manufacturers \nand technologies. Interoperability standards,\

    \ \nresource \nallocation, \nenergy \nmanagement, and decision-making. \n \nVI.\
    \ Convolutional neural network \nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a \n\
    class of deep learning algorithms that have \nrevolutionized various fields, particularly\
    \ in \ncomputer \nvision \ntasks \nsuch \nas \nimage \nclassification, object\
    \ detection, and image \nsegmentation. \nCNNs \nare \ndesigned \nto \nautomatically\
    \ learn hierarchical representations \nof \ndata \nthrough \nmultiple \nlayers\
    \ \nof \ninterconnected neurons. \na. Architecture: \nThe architecture of a CNN\
    \ is inspired by the \nvisual processing in the human brain. It consists \nof\
    \ several layers, including convolutional layers, \npooling layers, and fully\
    \ connected layers. The \nkey components of a CNN are: \na) Convolutional Layers:\
    \ Convolutional layers \nare responsible for extracting local features \nfrom\
    \ input data. They consist of filters (also \ncalled kernels) that convolve over\
    \ the input \ndata, performing element-wise multiplications \nand summations to\
    \ produce feature maps. \nMultiple filters are used to capture different \nfeatures\
    \ at various spatial locations. \nb) Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample\
    \ \nthe \nfeature \nmaps \nobtained \nfrom \nthe \nconvolutional layers. They\
    \ reduce the spatial \ndimensions of the feature maps while retaining \nthe most\
    \ important features. Common pooling \noperations include max pooling and average\
    \ \npooling. \nc) Fully Connected Layers: Fully connected \nlayers are traditional\
    \ neural network layers that \ntake the flattened feature maps from the \nNEUROQUANTOLOGY\

    non-linear \ncombinations \nof \nfeatures. \nThey \nperform \nclassification or\
    \ regression tasks based on the \nextracted features. \n \nb. Working Principle:\
    \ \nCNNs work based on the principle of local \nreceptive fields and weight sharing.\
    \ The local \nreceptive field refers to a small region of the \ninput data that\
    \ is connected to a particular \nneuron in the convolutional layer. Weight \n\
    sharing refers to the fact that the same set of \nweights (filters) is applied\
    \ across the entire \ninput data to detect different features. This \nallows CNNs\
    \ to efficiently learn and extract \nspatially invariant features. \nDuring training,\
    \ CNNs learn the optimal weights \nfor the filters and fully connected layers\
    \ \nthrough a process called backpropagation, \nwhere the errors between the predicted\
    \ \noutputs and the ground truth labels are \npropagated backward, updating the\
    \ weights \nusing gradient descent optimization algorithms \nsuch as stochastic\
    \ gradient descent (SGD) or \nAdam. \n \nc. State-of-the-Art CNN Architectures:\
    \ \nOver the years, several state-of-the-art CNN \narchitectures have been developed,\
    \ pushing the \nboundaries of performance in various computer \nvision \ntasks.\
    \ \nSome \nnotable \narchitectures \ninclude: \na) AlexNet: Introduced in 2012,\
    \ AlexNet was \none of the first deep CNN architectures to \nachieve breakthrough\
    \ results in the ImageNet \nLarge \nScale \nVisual Recognition \nChallenge \n\
    (ILSVRC). It consisted of multiple convolutional \nand fully connected layers\
    \ and set the stage for \nsubsequent advancements in CNNs. \nb) VGGNet: VGGNet,\
    \ proposed in 2014, was \ncharacterized \nby \nits \ndeep \narchitecture, \nconsisting\
    \ \nof \n16-19 \nlayers. \nIt \nachieved \nimpressive \nresults \non \nvarious\
    \ \nimage \nclassification \nbenchmarks, \nshowcasing \nthe \nimportance of deep\
    \ networks. \nc) ResNet: Residual Networks, or ResNets, \nintroduced in 2015,\
    \ addressed the challenge of \ntraining very deep networks by introducing skip\
    \ \nconnections. These connections allowed the \nnetwork to learn residual mappings\
    \ and \nsignificantly improved the performance on \nextremely deep architectures.\
    \ \nd) InceptionNet: InceptionNet, or GoogLeNet, \nproposed in 2014, introduced\
    \ the concept of \n\"Inception\" modules, which enabled efficient \nand parallel\
    \ computation of multiple filter sizes. \nThis \narchitecture \ndemonstrated \n\
    strong \nperformance while reducing the computational \ncomplexity. \ne) DenseNet:\
    \ DenseNet, introduced in 2016, \nintroduced dense connections between layers,\
    \ \nwhere each layer received inputs from all \npreceding layers. This architecture\
    \ encouraged \nfeature reuse, enhanced gradient flow, and \nachieved \nexcellent\
    \ \nperformance \nwhile \nmaintaining network compactness. \n \nVII. \nDesign\
    \ of WSN-CVIoT System \nThe design of a Wireless Sensor Network \nSystem for Clever\
    \ Vegetation-IoT (WSN-CVIoT) \nusing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \ninvolves\
    \ the integration of wireless sensor \nnetworks, the Internet of Things, and CNN-\n\
    based vegetation analysis techniques. The goal \nof the system is to enable intelligent\
    \ and \nefficient monitoring, analysis, and management \nof vegetation in various\
    \ applications such as \nprecision \nagriculture, \nenvironmental \nmonitoring,\
    \ and urban green spaces. This \nsection outlines the key components and design\
    \ \nconsiderations for the WSN-CVIoT system. \n \na. Sensor Node Design: \nThe\
    \ WSN-CVIoT system begins with the design \nof sensor nodes that are deployed\
    \ in the field to \ncollect data related to vegetation health and \nenvironmental\
    \ conditions. The sensor nodes \nshould be equipped with appropriate sensors to\
    \ \nmeasure parameters such as temperature, \nhumidity, light intensity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air \nquality. The design of sensor nodes should \nconsider factors\
    \ such as power efficiency, data \naccuracy, and reliability to ensure long-term\
    \ \noperation and data integrity. \nb. Wireless Communication: \nNEUROQUANTOLOGY\

    \ nodes \nand facilitate data transmission, a wireless \ncommunication protocol\
    \ should be selected. \nCommon protocols for WSNs include Zigbee, \nWi-Fi, LoRaWAN,\
    \ or cellular networks. The \nselection of the protocol depends on factors \n\
    such as the size of the deployment area, power \nconsumption, data rate requirements,\
    \ and \navailable infrastructure. The chosen protocol \nshould \nprovide \nreliable\
    \ \nand \nsecure \ncommunication between sensor nodes and the \ncentral system.\
    \ \n \nFigure 1. Design of WSN-CVIoT System \n \nc. Data Aggregation and Transmission:\
    \ \nIn a WSN-CVIoT system, data aggregation plays \na crucial role in minimizing\
    \ network traffic and \nconserving energy. Aggregation techniques, \nsuch as data\
    \ fusion or compression, can be \nemployed to reduce the amount of data \ntransmitted\
    \ by combining and summarizing \ninformation from multiple sensor nodes. The \n\
    aggregated data can then be transmitted to a \ncentral gateway or directly to\
    \ the cloud using \nthe selected wireless communication protocol. \nThe transmission\
    \ should ensure data security \nand \nintegrity \nthrough \nencryption \nand \n\
    authentication mechanisms. \nd. Cloud Infrastructure: \nThe WSN-CVIoT system leverages\
    \ cloud-based \ninfrastructure to store, process, and analyze the \ncollected\
    \ data. The cloud platform should \nprovide \nscalable \nstorage \ncapacity, \n\
    computational resources, and data processing \ncapabilities. Cloud services such\
    \ as Amazon \nWeb Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google \nCloud Platform\
    \ can be utilized to host the \nsystem infrastructure and enable seamless data\
    \ \nmanagement, analysis, and visualization. \ne. CNN-based Vegetation Analysis:\
    \ \nThe captured data from the WSN is utilized for \nvegetation analysis using\
    \ CNNs. The design of \nthe CNN architecture should consider the \nspecific analysis\
    \ tasks, such as plant disease \ndetection, \ncrop \ngrowth \nmonitoring, \nor\
    \ \nvegetation classification. The CNN model should \nbe trained using labeled\
    \ datasets, incorporating \ntechniques such as data augmentation, transfer \n\
    learning, or fine-tuning to improve the model's \naccuracy and generalization.\
    \ The trained CNN \nmodel can be deployed in the cloud or at the \nedge to analyze\
    \ the collected data and extract \nmeaningful insights about vegetation health.\

    \ \nsystem can generate actionable insights and \ndecision recommendations. Decision-making\
    \ \nalgorithms can be developed to interpret the \nvegetation \nanalysis \nresults\
    \ \nand \ntrigger \nappropriate actions. These actions can include \nautomated\
    \ irrigation control, pest management \ninterventions, optimal resource allocation,\
    \ or \ngenerating alerts for timely interventions. \nActuators and control mechanisms\
    \ can be \nintegrated into the system to enable automated \nresponses based on\
    \ the analyzed data. \ng. User Interface and Visualization: \nTo facilitate user\
    \ interaction and decision-\nmaking, the WSN-CVIoT system should provide \na user-friendly\
    \ interface and visualization tools. \nThis \ncan \ninclude \nweb \nor \nmobile-based\
    \ \napplications that display real-time sensor data, \nanalysis \nresults, \n\
    and \nactionable \ninsights. \nVisualization techniques, such as charts, maps,\
    \ \nor graphical representations, can be employed \nto present thedata in a comprehensible\
    \ and \nintuitive manner. Users should be able to access \nhistorical \ndata,\
    \ \ncustomize \nvisualization \nparameters, and interact with the system to \n\
    make informed decisions and take necessary \nactions. \nh. Security and Privacy:\
    \ \nThe design of the WSN-CVIoT system should \nprioritize security and privacy\
    \ considerations. \nMeasures \nsuch \nas \ndata \nencryption, \nauthentication,\
    \ access control, and secure \ncommunication \nprotocols \nshould \nbe \nimplemented\
    \ to protect sensitive data from \nunauthorized access or tampering. Additionally,\
    \ \nprivacy concerns related to the collection and \nstorage of personal or location-based\
    \ data \nshould be addressed in compliance with \napplicable regulations and best\
    \ practices. \ni. \nScalability and Flexibility: \nThe WSN-CVIoT system should\
    \ be designed to \naccommodate scalability and flexibility. It \nshould be capable\
    \ of supporting a varying \nnumber of sensor nodes, expanding coverage \nareas,\
    \ and integrating additional functionalities \nor sensors as needed. The system\
    \ architecture \nshould \nbe \nmodular \nand \nadaptable \nto \naccommodate future\
    \ enhancements or changes \nin requirements. \n \nVIII. Conclusion \nWireless\
    \ sensor networks, Internet of Things \n(IoT) connectivity, cloud infrastructure,\
    \ and \nCNN-based vegetation analysis methods are all \nintegrated into the architecture\
    \ of a WSN-CVIoT \nsystem. The technology makes it possible to \nmonitor, analyse,\
    \ and manage vegetation in \ndiverse applications in an intelligent and \neffective\
    \ manner. The design concerns include \nuser interface and visualisation, security\
    \ and \nprivacy, scalability, and adaptability. They also \ncover \nwireless \n\
    communication, \ndata \naggregation \nand \ntransmission, \ncloud \ninfrastructure,\

    practices that aim to increase productivity, adapt to climate change, and reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions. CSA practices can include using drought-tolerant crop
    varieties, implementing water conservation measures, and using renewable energy
    sources.


    The study by Ghosh and colleagues (2023) provides a comprehensive overview of
    the current state of CSA research, identifying key themes and gaps in knowledge.
    The authors conducted a systematic review of over 100 studies on CSA, and found
    that the most common topics of research were:


    * Adaptation to climate change

    * Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions

    * Sustainable intensification of agriculture

    * Food security and nutrition


    The authors also found that there is a need for more research on the economic
    and social impacts of CSA, as well as on the development of CSA practices that
    are suitable for smallholder farmers in developing countries.


    Overall, the study by Ghosh and colleagues provides valuable insights into the
    current state of CSA research, and highlights the need for further research in
    this area.'

    \ sector is one of the backbones of many countries’ economies. Its processes\n\
    have been changing to enable technology adoption to increase productivity, quality,\
    \ and sustainable\ndevelopment. In this research, we present a scientiﬁc mapping\
    \ of the adoption of precision techniques\nand breakthrough technologies in agriculture,\
    \ so-called Digital Agriculture. To do this, we used\n4694 documents from the\
    \ Web of Science database to perform a Bibliometric Performance and\nNetwork Analysis\
    \ of the literature using SciMAT software with the support of the PICOC protocol.\n\
    Our ﬁndings presented 22 strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture, such\
    \ as Internet of Things\n(IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Climate-smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSA), among others. The\nthematic network structure of the nine\
    \ most important clusters (motor themes) was presented and\nan in-depth discussion\
    \ was performed. The thematic evolution map provides a broad perspective\nof how\
    \ the ﬁeld has evolved over time from 1994 to 2020. In addition, our results discuss\
    \ the main\nchallenges and opportunities for research and practice in the ﬁeld\
    \ of study. Our ﬁndings provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the main themes related\
    \ to Digital Agriculture. These results show the\nmain subjects analyzed on this\
    \ topic and provide a basis for insights for future research.\nKeywords: precision\
    \ agriculture; agriculture 4.0; digital agriculture; smart farming; industry 4.0;\n\
    sustainability; innovation; bibliometrics; science mapping\n1. Introduction\n\
    The ﬁeld and the concept itself of agriculture have dramatically changed and have\n\
    been profoundly revolutionized over time, with the introduction of new approaches\
    \ and\nconcepts, such as those of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (A4.0). These have\ngiven rise to so-called Digital Agriculture (DA). Around\
    \ 10,000 years ago, humans began to\ndedicate efforts to domesticating plants\
    \ and animals, spreading seeds, planting seedlings,\nand using animal force to\
    \ plow the land [1]. This revolution that changed human life and\ntransformed\
    \ hunter-gatherers into farmers is called the Neolithic Revolution or the First\n\
    Agricultural Revolution [2]. Although this revolution was a great leap for humankind—as\n\
    it allowed the cultivation of plants and guaranteed food for the population—the\
    \ new\nactivities demanded more hours of work [2]. This dedication to agriculture\
    \ generated\na surplus of food that multiplied the number of people and created\
    \ elites who owned\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21237889\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n2 of 28\nand controlled\
    \ land and food [2]. Between the First Agricultural Revolution and the\nprosperous\
    \ and abundant society that we have today, thousands of years have passed, and\n\
    several transformations have occurred in the ways of production, and several difﬁculties\n\
    related to economic niches, malnutrition and wars over ﬁelds and cultures have\
    \ arisen [2].\nThese signiﬁcant disadvantages and shortcomings have led to new\
    \ transformations and\nrevolutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture [3].\nIn the 19th\
    \ century, Agriculture 2.0, also known as the Second Agricultural Revolution,\n\
    changed farming by introducing ad hoc machinery, selective breeding, animal fertilizer,\n\
    crop rotation, reapers and tractors that contributed to shaping the ﬁrst steps\
    \ of modern\nagriculture [1]. Food started to be produced faster in this frame,\
    \ but farmers were hindered\nby rust, pests, and soil depletion. New techniques\
    \ and technologies have increased food\nsurplus and reduced the need for labor\
    \ in agriculture, forcing the migration of workers\nand the urbanization and the\
    \ growth of cities [4,5]. This workforce allocation in towns was\nan integral\
    \ part of the industrial revolution, which stimulated the rise of manufacturing\n\
    industries [4].\nTo deal with the challenges of the Second Agricultural Revolution,\
    \ Agriculture 3.0 or\nthe Third Agricultural Revolution emerged in the 20th and\
    \ early 21st centuries. Between\n1966 and 1985, the concept of the Green Revolution\
    \ was introduced, especially in terms\nof the use of advanced, cutting-edge technologies,\
    \ such as biotechnology and genetic\nengineering to generate genetically varieties,\
    \ hybrid plants and animals [6,7], and this\nprovided a real breakthrough in agriculture.\
    \ The third revolution was characterized by\nthe further introduction of new technologies,\
    \ such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem) to monitor animals and crops,\
    \ computers and devices for data management and\nanalysis of agricultural production-related\
    \ information, robots, chemicals, fertilizers, and\nirrigation systems to increase\
    \ productivity and production quality [1]. These transforma-\ntions greatly impacted\
    \ the quality of agricultural production and the societal, economic,\nand environmental\
    \ pillars of sustainability [8].\nThe concept of PA emerged in 1980 and represented\
    \ the adoption of precision tech-\nniques and technologies used singly or in combination\
    \ [9] to control ﬁeld variability [10,11].\nDespite the concept of PA appearing\
    \ during the Third Agricultural Revolution, its tech-\nniques and technologies\
    \ were mainly exploited in the context of the Fourth Industrial\nRevolution, driven\
    \ by the Industry 4.0 concept [11]. A4.0 represents the use of technologies\n\
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence, big data, cloud\
    \ computing,\nand other smart systems and devices for managing crops and farms\
    \ [11,12]. In this sense,\nboth terms are related to DA, which can be perceived\
    \ as a major driver for changes and\nevolution in sustainability, food security,\
    \ efﬁciency, and productivity.\nDespite the fact that these revolutions have,\
    \ at least partially, solved food production\nand security problems, the increase\
    \ in population and the scarcity of resources are worri-\nsome challenges for\
    \ modern agriculture. Nowadays, almost one billion people go to sleep\nhungry\
    \ every day [13]. The human population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050\
    \ [11],\nincreasing food demand by up to 50% [14]. Most of these people are expected\
    \ to live in\nSouth Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 20% of the current\
    \ population is\nfood insecure [15]. In addition, agriculture is responsible for\
    \ consuming 70% of the world’s\ndrinking water [11]. Human consumption of resources\
    \ has tripled in the last 50 years, and\nthe exploitation of resources is 30%\
    \ greater than nature’s ability to regenerate [16]. From\nthis perspective, the\
    \ challenges involved in producing more food with less environmental\nimpact are\
    \ evident [17]. Given this backdrop, emerging technologies can enable sustainable\n\
    agricultural production, and the main challenges, in terms of either structural\
    \ or perceived\nobstacles and barriers, as well as the major opportunities of\
    \ their technological adoption,\nneed to be explored.\nSeveral studies have revised\
    \ the changes and revolutions that have occurred in the\nﬁeld of agriculture to\
    \ understand the effects of technology adoption and its potential to deal\nwith\
    \ challenges related to food production for the current and future generations.\
    \ Kim et al.\n(2019) and Raparelli and Bajocco (2019) [18,19] performed bibliometric\
    \ analyses on the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n3 of 28\nuse of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAV) in agriculture, and Terence and Purushothaman\n(2020) and Navarro et al.\
    \ (2020) [20,21] systematically reviewed the use of IoT in smart\nfarms. In addition,\
    \ previously published studies explored the use of Machine Learning\n(ML) techniques\
    \ [22–24], geospatial technology [25], and big data for smart farming [26,27].\n\
    Extensive reviews show PA technologies’ state of the art [28] and the main factors\
    \ that\ninﬂuence technological adoption [29]. Although some reviews and overviews\
    \ have already\nbeen carried out, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated\
    \ the complete\nevolution of the ﬁeld of study over time or discussed the digitalization\
    \ process of agricul-\nture. The present paper addresses precisely this literature\
    \ gap by highlighting the main\nchallenges and opportunities related to Digital\
    \ Agriculture.\nDue to the transformational potential of emerging technologies\
    \ for agriculture overviewed\nin the above-mentioned reviews, the present paper\
    \ is devoted to offering a scientiﬁc map-\nping approach to identify strategic\
    \ themes, the thematic evolution structure and the main\nchallenges and opportunities\
    \ of Digital Agriculture. For this, the PICOC protocol (Popula-\ntion, Intervention,\
    \ Comparison, Outcome, and Context) was used to guide and ensure the\nquality\
    \ of this study. The SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool), developed\
    \ by\nCobo et al. (2012) [30], was used for data treatment and generation of the\
    \ strategic diagram\nand the evolutionary map of the ﬁeld of study.\nThe paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the research background.\nSection\
    \ 3 contains materials and methods.\nResults and discussions are presented in\n\
    Section 4. The main challenges and opportunities are presented in Section 5, and\
    \ Section 6\npresents the conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for further\
    \ research.\n2. Research Background\nDifferent terms can be used (and have been\
    \ used) to refer to the ﬁelds of PA and\nA4.0 [31]. Some authors closely associate\
    \ them, whereas, in the current work, we operate\na distinction between PA and\
    \ A4.0. While PA is often related to issues of ﬁeld variability\nand speciﬁc analyses\
    \ and technologies, such as application of agricultural inputs in areas\nwith\
    \ the most signiﬁcant productive potential (e.g., the use of georeferenced data\
    \ for\nthe application of chemicals according to the needs of each area), A4.0\
    \ goes beyond the\nanalysis of ﬁeld variability and aims to manage farms based\
    \ on detailed knowledge of the\nspeciﬁc context and situation, to create a value\
    \ chain that fully integrates, incorporates\nand involves stakeholders, technologies\
    \ and agricultural processes [11,31,32]. Due to the\nvariety of concepts, theoretical\
    \ frameworks/approaches and interpretations related to the\ntechnological adoption\
    \ in agriculture, in this research, the term Digital Agriculture is used\nto describe\
    \ both concepts associated with digital transformation in agriculture without\n\
    considering the technological level.\n2.1. Precision Agriculture\nThe PA concept\
    \ represents the use of techniques and emerging technologies for crop\nmanagement,\
    \ pest control and ﬁeld improvement [11,33]. With PA, it is possible to increase\n\
    crop quality and crop productivity. Since 1980, with the introduction of sophisticated,\n\
    cutting-edge analyses, there has been a considerable increase in the use of technology\
    \ in\nagriculture. For instance, the global soybean production could be 32 million\
    \ tons higher\nif the PA were massively adopted [34]. Progressively, new techniques\
    \ and technologies\nwere developed, with researchers and practitioners gradually\
    \ exploring how to provide an\nenhanced range of advantages for the primary sector\
    \ [11].\nTherefore, several studies have shown the importance of the adoption\
    \ of PA for\nreducing/minimizing environmental impacts while preserving food production\
    \ [35–37].\nFor instance, the efﬁcient analysis of phosphorus and potassium through\
    \ PA technologies\ncontributes to agriculture being more sustainable [34]. PA\
    \ research is also related to\nthe identiﬁcation of management zones [38,39],\
    \ analysis and management of soil and\nplant nutrients [40–42], UAV applications\
    \ for a proper capture and analysis of plantation\ndata [43,44], farmers’ perception\
    \ [45] and others.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n4 of 28\nRelated to PA, there are\
    \ several terms and concepts, ranging from Precision/Open\nField/Farming (PF)\
    \ to Precision Horticulture (PH) (or controlled-environmental agriculture\n(CEA)\
    \ and Vertical Farming (VF)), Precision Animal Farming (PAF), including Precision\n\
    Aquaculture (Fisheries). These sectors are also very important in food production,\
    \ being\n“concentrated capital” and “economically and technologically manageable”.\
    \ This reﬂects\nthe non-uniform, but multi-faceted and complex nature of the ﬁeld\
    \ of PA.\n2.2. Agriculture 4.0\nThe concept of A4.0 emerged after the introduction\
    \ and development of the concept of\nIndustry 4.0 in 2011 and seeks to use the\
    \ same technologies used by factories of the future\nto create a new level of\
    \ agricultural production for ensuring food safety and protection\nof the environment\
    \ [11]. A4.0 represents the use of emerging technologies to develop a\nvalue chain\
    \ that successfully integrates organizations, farmers, customers, and all relevant\n\
    stakeholders in favor of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Therefore,\
    \ A4.0\nis important for mitigating several global concerns related to productivity,\
    \ proﬁtability,\ncost reduction and efﬁciency [11], including mitigating against\
    \ climate change effects and\nallocating agricultural resources in a reasonable\
    \ and ethical way [35]. Given this, there\nis an evident growing interest from\
    \ the scholarly community towards the topic of digital\nagriculture [46].\nA4.0\
    \ seems to be a more comprehensive and broader concept than PA, as it seeks\n\
    to integrate all actors in agri-food production through a technological value\
    \ chain. In\nthis perspective, A4.0 goes beyond local and speciﬁc analyses to\
    \ include all agricultural\nprocesses. Studies related to A4.0 address the development\
    \ of decision support systems to\nintegrate all members of the production chain\
    \ [1], responsible innovation [47], real-time\nintegration of IoT for agriculture\
    \ [48], and the potential of A4.0 to address major societal\nissues associated\
    \ with environmental sustainability (e.g., carbon emissions and exploitation\n\
    of natural resources), social (e.g., impact on labor and food security) and economic\
    \ sustain-\nability (e.g., productivity, costs and agriculture as a subsistence\
    \ economy) [11,32,49–52],\namong others.\n3. Materials and Methods\nWe use the\
    \ PICOC protocol and SciMAT software to perform a Bibliometric Perfor-\nmance\
    \ and Network Analysis (BPNA) to achieve our goal. PICOC ensured the robustness\n\
    and deﬁnition of the research criteria. At the same time, SciMAT helped identify\
    \ the strate-\ngic themes, the thematic evolution structure and the main challenges\
    \ and opportunities in\nthe ﬁeld of study.\n3.1. PICOC Protocol\nThe PICOC protocol\
    \ was used to deﬁne the research questions [53], the key terms\nand variants [54],\
    \ and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of papers\nrelated\
    \ to the ﬁeld of study [55]. This method ensures the quality and reproducibility\
    \ of\nthe research with the lowest bias from the researchers. In this study, the\
    \ process of the\nPICOC protocol was adapted, slightly modifying the search and\
    \ analysis steps presented\nby Bruzza et al. (2017) and Silva et al. (2020) [55,56].\
    \ Table 1 shows the attributes according\nto the PICOC protocol.\nWith the support\
    \ of the PICOC protocol, we deﬁned three major research questions\n(RQ1–3):\n\
    RQ1: What are the strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture?\nRQ2: How has\
    \ the thematic evolution of Digital Agriculture occurred over time?\nRQ3: What\
    \ are the main challenges and opportunities of Digital Agriculture?\nSensors 2021,\

    Bibliometric software\nScience Mapping Analysis Software Tool (SciMAT)\nFor bibliometric\
    \ analysis and identiﬁcation of strategic themes and the evolutionary\nmap of\
    \ the ﬁeld, we used the SciMAT software developed by Cobo et al. (2012) [30].\
    \ We\nchose the SciMAT because it assists all stages of scientiﬁc mapping, from\
    \ data preprocessing\nto the generation of maps of the ﬁeld of study [30,52,59,60].\
    \ In addition, the SciMAT\npresents a robust preprocessing module, which ensures\
    \ data quality [30]. With the support\nof the SciMAT, we plotted a strategic diagram\
    \ and the intellectual network structure of the\nmost important themes [61–63].\
    \ In addition, it was possible to generate an evolutionary\ndiagram that presented\
    \ the most important themes of the ﬁeld of study distributed over\ntime. Figure\
    \ 1 illustrates an example of the strategic diagram (a), thematic network structure\n\
    (b), and thematic evolution structure (c), where the size of the clusters represents\
    \ the\nnumber of associated documents and the importance of the theme for the\
    \ research ﬁeld,\nand the thickness of the lines represents the strength of the\
    \ relationship between the\nclusters [30,59,60]. The evolutionary map was created\
    \ based on the equivalence index,\nwhere the solid lines (Figure 1c) indicate\
    \ that the clusters share the main theme (main\ntheme ∈ {thematic nexuses}). In\
    \ contrast, dashed lines represent a connection between the\nnon-main elements\
    \ (main theme /∈ {thematic nexuses}), and the absence of lines means that\nthe\
    \ theme was discontinued from one period to the following period(s) [64].\nSensors\

    \ and later subdivided into three \nsubperiods (1994–2011; 2012–2017; 2018–2020)\

    \ of 28\nAfter deﬁning the subperiods, we generated the diagrams based on the\
    \ keyword\nco-occurrence matrix with the SciMAT to identify the most important\
    \ themes and their\nnodes with other clusters [66–68]. To determine the similarity\
    \ between themes, data were\nthen normalized using the Equivalence Index [69]\
    \ and clustered based on the Simple\nCenters Algorithm (SCA) to create a network\
    \ of relationships [70]. To make the diagrams,\nwe reduced the data on a frequency\
    \ reduction of eight times. We deﬁned a maximum and\nminimum network of 12 and\
    \ 3, respectively, to plot only the most important clusters of\nthe ﬁeld of study\
    \ (for more information, see Cobo et al. (2012) [30]). The clusters were\nplotted\
    \ on a two-dimensional diagram with four quadrants (Q1–4) (e.g., Figure 1a) whose\n\
    horizontal axis represents the centrality of the themes and their number of connections\n\
    with other themes, and the vertical axis represents the density of the connections\
    \ between\nclusters [11,13,59,60]. In other words, clusters with high centrality\
    \ tend to co-occur with\nmany other themes, while clusters with high density have\
    \ very dense co-occurrence links\nwith speciﬁc themes. This analysis highlights\
    \ the correlational breadth between two or\nmore themes over time. The four quadrants\
    \ are deﬁned as follows:\n•\nMotor themes (Q1): the upper right clusters are highly\
    \ developed themes. The strong\ncentrality and density represent the high number\
    \ of associated documents and the\nmany links between these themes and others.\
    \ In this sense, motor clusters are the\nmost developed and important themes in\
    \ the ﬁeld of study and are related to many\nother subjects/topics.\n•\nBasic\
    \ and transversal themes (Q2): clusters in the lower right quadrant are themes\n\
    that have many relationships with other themes but whose relationships are weak.\n\
    Despite these clusters’ great development and links with different themes, the\
    \ low\ndensity indicates little capacity to sustain over time.\n•\nEmerging or\
    \ declining themes (Q3): they represent clusters with few and weak links\nwith\
    \ other themes, which may appear or disappear in the ﬁeld of study. These\nthemes\
    \ need in-depth qualitative analysis by researchers to identify whether they are\n\
    emerging or declining. Over time, these clusters may cease to be discussed or\
    \ move to\nother quadrants.\n•\nHighly developed and isolated themes (Q4): the\
    \ upper left quadrant comprises of low\ncentrality and high-density clusters.\
    \ These clusters have few but strong links with\nother themes. The strong centrality\
    \ of these themes shows their ability to prevail over\ntime, to develop links\
    \ with other clusters and, perhaps, to become motor themes.\nThe motor themes\
    \ of the strategic diagram were explored to identify the relationships\nwith other\
    \ themes. In this way, it was possible to identify technologies, techniques and\n\
    other widely discussed subjects/topics and the main challenges and opportunities\
    \ of\nDigital Agriculture.\nAs a last remark to the methodology adopted in the\
    \ present study, we would like\nto stress two major points. First, as also previously\
    \ mentioned, to the best of our knowl-\nedge, the present investigation is the\
    \ ﬁrst to perform a bibliometric analysis related to\nthe ﬁeld of Digital Agriculture.\
    \ As such, this study should be intended as being of an\nexploratory nature, providing\
    \ readers with a preliminary, though broad, comprehensive,\nand detailed overview\
    \ of the existing scholarly literature covering the research area of\nDigital\
    \ Agriculture. Therefore, we decided to focus on PA, not including other PA-related\n\
    terms as keywords, and we did not attempt to explore its multi-faceted, complex\
    \ nature\nand its sub-sectors (namely, PH, CEA, VF, PAF or Precision Aquaculture/Fisheries).\
    \ These\naspects warrant further ad hoc reviews (either in the form of systematic\
    \ overviews or\nmapping/scoping reviews), based also on the ﬁndings of the present\
    \ investigation.\n4. Results\nTo explore in-depth the DA ﬁeld, we conducted a\

    In 1994, the term Precision Agriculture started to be widely discussed in studies\n\
    that evaluated the rate of application of inputs in crops [71], the spatial and\
    \ temporal\nvariability of yields [72–74] and the potential of precision techniques\
    \ for conserving natural\nresources [75]. After the initial introduction and its\

    \ the term Agriculture 4.0 came to have a broader\nemphasis and scope for adopting\
    \ digital technology in agriculture and representing the\ncreation of a value\

    \ related to Digital Agriculture\nwere published, in 2017, the number reached\
    \ 374 articles, and 762 studies were published\nin 2019. In 2020, the data collection\

    \ in the number of publications in recent years is warranted by the devel-\nopment\
    \ and maturity the ﬁeld is reaching and achieving and by the number of researchers\n\
    who have made efforts to understand the impact of technology adoption in agriculture.\n\
    Different aspects of a ﬁeld of study can be understood and quantiﬁed through bibliometric\n\

    \ 3) presents 22 clusters distributed in four quadrants\nof the two-dimensional\
    \ diagram, of which nine are motor themes (Q1), two are basic and\ntransversal\
    \ themes (Q2), eight are emerging or declining themes (Q3), and three are highly\n\
    developed and isolated themes (Q4). The size of each cluster is proportional to\
    \ the number\nof associated documents. The horizontal axis represents the links\
    \ from one cluster to others\n(centrality), and the vertical axis demonstrates\
    \ the strength of these links (density). The\ntable in Figure 3 shows the core\
    \ documents, h-index, number of cites, centrality (C), and\ndensity (D) of each\
    \ theme.\nThe ‘UAV’ (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) cluster contains the largest number\
    \ of associ-\nated documents. It is the most expressive theme in terms of h-index,\
    \ number of cites and\ncentrality, highlighting this cluster as one of the most\
    \ discussed themes in the literature.\nThe cluster ‘CSA’ (Climate-smart Agriculture)\
    \ also has expressive core documents. It\nis the ﬁrst ranked in terms of density,\
    \ but its low centrality shows that the relationship\nbetween CSA and other themes\
    \ is still underexplored. Other clusters that stand out are\n‘IoT’ (Internet of\
    \ Things), ‘SPATIAL-VARIABILITY’, ‘GPS’ (Global Positioning System),\n‘IMAGE-PROCESSING’,\
    \ ‘NITROGEN’, ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘YIELD-PREDICTION’\n(Figure 3). These motor\
    \ themes (Q1) are explored in depth through the thematic network\nstructures in\
    \ the following subsection.\nIn addition, ‘NDVI’ (Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index) and ‘SUSTAINABILITY’\nappear to be basic and transversal themes (Figure\
    \ 3) and represent the concern for the sus-\ntainable development of agriculture.\
    \ Other techniques appear related to crop management,\nsuch as ‘WEED-CONTROL’,\
    \ ‘CROP-MODEL’, ‘SOIL-TEXTURE’, ‘PHENOTYPING’, ‘SOIL-\nCOMPACTION’ and ‘WATER-PRODUCTIVITY’,\
    \ and others are related to technologies,\nsuch as ‘HYPERSPECTRAL-IMAGERY’, ‘SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES’,\
    \ ‘EM38′, and\n‘AGRICULTURAL-ROBOTICS’. Although some clusters represent speciﬁc\
    \ analyses and\ntechniques related to productivity and quality of agricultural\
    \ production, the motor themes\nhighlight the transformation expected for food\
    \ production in the coming years.\n4.3. Motor Themes Related to Digital Agriculture\n\
    We explored the thematic network structure (Figure 4) of the motor themes presented\n\
    in the strategic diagram (Figure 3). This analysis highlights the relationships\
    \ of a cluster\nwith others and provides an in-depth view of the ﬁeld of research.\
    \ The size of each cluster is\nproportional to the number of associated documents,\
    \ and the thickness of the lines denotes\nthe binding force between clusters.\n\
    4.3.1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nThe cluster ‘UAV’ presents signiﬁcant importance\
    \ in the strategic diagram (Figure 3)\ndue to its high degree of interactions\
    \ with the other motor themes. The UAV corresponds\nto a pilotless aircraft, i.e.,\
    \ a ﬂying machine operated with no humans (passenger/pilot)\nonboard [78]. Some\
    \ previous literature reviews and meta-analysis explored the use of\nUAVs in agriculture,\
    \ as in research by Lelong et al. (2012) [79], Singh and Frazier (2018) [80],\n\
    Shahbazi et al. (2014) [81] and Eskandari et al. (2020) [82]. UAVs are low-cost\
    \ and easy-\nto-operate technologies in agriculture [83] that can be adopted for\
    \ spraying in ﬁelds [84],\nsuch as water precision irrigation. Given the technological\
    \ advancement emerging in\ndifferent countries, UAVs have gained more and more\
    \ space and importance for smart\nfarming [83,85]. Various sensors can be coupled\
    \ to UAVs [85] associated with techniques,\nsuch as photogrammetry, Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM), multi-spectral and hyper-spectral\nimages, and technologies,\
    \ such as Machine Learning, LiDAR, and sensors, cameras and\nother hardware and\
    \ software that contribute to monitoring the crop. This seems to justify\nthe\
    \ strong relationship between UAV and the subtheme ‘REMOTE-SENSING’, followed\n\
    by the subthemes ‘MACHINE-LEARNING’ and ‘VEGETATION-INDICES’ among others\n(Figure\
    \ 4a).\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n12 of 28\nFigure 4a shows the relationship between\
    \ UAV and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),\nwhile UAV focuses on the development\
    \ and use of robots; UAS includes ground-based\ncontrollers, communication systems,\
    \ payloads, electro-optical systems, radar, and software\nfor aircraft vehicles.\
    \ The sensors in the drones can generate vegetation indices, helping\nto monitor\
    \ crop growth diagnosis and grain yield prediction [86]; disaster detection in\n\
    environmental areas [87]; the existence of pests and pathogens in the crop; the\
    \ analysis\nof the health and stress status of the vegetation; and the assessment\
    \ of soil fertility for\nappropriate remote management and precise and reduced\
    \ application of agrochemicals,\ndriving sustainable agriculture [85] and increased\
    \ productivity. New, sophisticated, cutting-\nedge techniques and approaches,\
    \ such as machine learning, improve decision-making in the\nﬁeld of precision\
    \ and digital agriculture, assisting and facilitating tasks like the prediction\n\
    of nitrogen index of the crop through remote sensing from UAV [83,88]. Thus, farm-related\n\
    data and information can be easily collected through drones, such as images [89],\
    \ and can\ngenerate knowledge that machine learning techniques can process to\
    \ make agriculture\nmore precise and digital. For instance, Zhang and Zhao (2019)\
    \ [90] used images of coastal\nsoils captured through UAV to identify salinization\
    \ levels and then proposed a method\nto improve the monitoring and management\
    \ of the soil for avoiding the negative impacts\nof salinization on crop growth\
    \ and production. Hence, this cluster highlights the central\nrole of UAV, which,\
    \ together with other emerging technologies, generates precision in\nagriculture\
    \ and enables the interconnection among technologies for better decision-making,\n\
    allowing farms to be smart.\n4.3.2. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)\nCSA (Figure\
    \ 4b) is a concept related to the adoption of best agricultural production\npractices\
    \ and methods for reorienting agriculture for environmental protection, food secu-\n\
    rity and climate change issues [15,91]. The population increase, land and environmental\n\
    degradation, and the negative impacts of the food system on the climate require\
    \ new\nagricultural practices. Within this framework, CSA is an extremely necessary\
    \ approach to\nﬁnd win-win solutions for the sustainable development of agriculture\
    \ [92]. Climate change\nand the degradation of the planet’s biodiversity cause\
    \ risks to the food supply, and the\nvulnerability of people who have agriculture\
    \ as their primary source of subsistence [15].\nTo deal with this, the resilient\
    \ agriculture model proposed by CSA seeks to create adaptive\ncoherence between\
    \ climate and agricultural practices [92]. To assist in the development\nof CSA,\
    \ farmers embrace technological innovations that could make agriculture more\n\
    sustainable. However, great governmental and academic incentives need to be dedicated\n\
    to assisting the agricultural sector in sustainable development [91,92].\nThis\
    \ high-density motor theme is related to sustainable agriculture, which shows\
    \ its\nstrong relationship with climate-related themes (e.g., ‘CLIMATE-CHANGE-ADAPTATION’\n\
    ‘CLIMATE-CHANGE’), environmental preservation (e.g., ‘CONSERVATION-AGRICULTURE’\n\
    ‘AGROFORESTRY’), organizations (e.g., ‘SMALLHOLDER FARMERS’) and discussions\n\
    related to agricultural resilience, food security and the main challenges for\
    \ organizations, es-\npecially for smallholders. Previous systematic reviews explored\
    \ the role of CSA [91,93–95].\nRelated research discusses technological adoption\
    \ [96], farmers’ adaptation to resilient\nagriculture [97], innovative economic\
    \ models [98], emerging ways to increase the resilience\nof smallholder farmers\
    \ [99], and the impact of CSA on food security [100], among other\nissues associated\
    \ with resilient agriculture.\n4.3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe cluster ‘IoT’\
    \ (Figure 4c) has a high degree of interactions with the subtheme\n‘WIRELESS-SENSOR-NETWORKS’,\
    \ followed by ‘BIG-DATA’, ‘ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE’,\n‘CLOUD-COMPUTING’ and others.\
    \ Internet of Things can be deﬁned as a grouping of\ntechnologies and infrastructures\
    \ that, wirelessly connected, enable data mining from inter-\nconnected objects,\
    \ as well as the monitoring and correct management of data [11,101]. It\nallows\
    \ remote access and control of objects [102]. Thus, IoT has been achieving a promi-\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 7889\n13 of 28\nnent role in agriculture. Both the quality and\
    \ quantity of production in the agricultural\nindustry have been maximized through\
    \ IoT [103], such as crop yield and efﬁciency [104].\nIoT technologies, such as\
    \ smart sensor networks, cameras, weather stations and smart-\nphone applications,\
    \ can improve crop data collection and decision-making for smart farm\nmanagement\
    \ [105].\nThere are many ways of adopting IoT in agriculture. Some authors have\
    \ explored\nprevious literature to understand IoT’s role, opportunities and challenges\
    \ in agricul-\nture [106–108]. Jin et al. (2020) [109] proposed a predictor based\
    \ on IoT to accurately\npredict/forecast temperature and humidity in ﬁelds, allowing\
    \ anticipated planning and\ncontrol for sustainable precision agriculture. Jayaraman\
    \ et al. (2016) [105] proposed an IoT\nplatform capable of expanding data collection\
    \ on soil, irrigation, fertilization and environ-\nmental conditions, generating\
    \ relationships among data for forecasting crop performance\nand boosting smart\
    \ farming. Relating IoT to blockchain, Hussain (2019) [110] developed a\nmodel\
    \ capable of helping in the migration from traditional to smart agriculture. Tekiner-\n\
    dogan (2018) [3] used IoT to create a portable agricultural sensor network system,\
    \ which\ncollects data (temperature, light intensity, and soil moisture content)\
    \ utilizing sensors and\na microcontroller to generate databases that can be used\
    \ through Big Data based analytics\nfor better crop management. These IoT actions\
    \ can be further enhanced and maximized\nwhen combined with artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ technologies, which facilitate the man-\nagement of data collected from different\
    \ objects and sources in the ﬁeld [102]. In addition,\nconnectivity on Digital\
    \ Agriculture through IoT becomes efﬁcient and effective when based\non cloud\
    \ computing [111]. Thus, regardless of the applications, IoT actions in agriculture\n\
    require investments in cloud computing to facilitate the collection, storage,\
    \ access, and\nmanagement of integrated data. Therefore, this cluster emphasizes\
    \ the importance of IoT\nas a link among different technologies, tools, equipment,\
    \ and machines that jointly improve\nprecision agriculture and, consequently,\
    \ lead to digital agriculture.\n4.3.4. Spatial Variability\nThe cluster ‘SPATIAL\
    \ VARIABILITY’ (Figure 4d) is a motor theme that presents strong\ninteractions\
    \ with geostatistics and management zones and contributes to monitoring soil\n\
    properties at agricultural sites. The analysis of the spatial variability of soil\
    \ attributes was\none of the ﬁrst precision techniques associated with crop management\
    \ and helps farmers\nto know chemical and physical characteristics of the soil\
    \ through sampling and analysis\nthat identify soil variations such as nutrients,\
    \ fertility, salinity, electrical conductivity, pH,\norganic matter, phosphorus,\
    \ and other important variables/parameters. Geostatistics\ntechniques such as\
    \ kriging, variogram analysis and interpolation reveal the heterogeneity\nof the\
    \ soil. These analyses allow us to understand intrinsic factors, such as soil\
    \ formation\nand relief, substances, organisms and climate, and extrinsic factors,\
    \ such as management\npractices, and fertilization rate, among others.\nTherefore,\
    \ this cluster is linked with increasing efﬁciency and crop productivity. The\n\
    analysis of spatial variability is, indeed, a key factor for increasing food production\
    \ [112]\nand farmers’ economic revenues [113]. The mapping of soil heterogeneity\
    \ has contributed\nto enhance soil data and to make geostatistics become a fundamental\
    \ tool in agricultural\nmanagement [114]. Some studies show that farmers visualize\
    \ the information of DA made\nby georeferenced analysis [115]. Despite its advantages,\
    \ spatial variability analyses often\nhave high costs that make it difﬁcult for\
    \ small farmers to use them. Future research needs\nto explore the improvement\
    \ of these techniques to increase the expansion of its use.\n4.3.5. Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS)\nThrough georeferencing, GPS was one of the ﬁrst big steps towards\
    \ Digital Agri-\nculture. The cluster ‘GPS’ (Figure 4e) is a motor theme that\
    \ presents strong interactions\nwith the subtheme Geographic Information Systems\
    \ (GIS). Other subthemes, such as\n‘YIELD-MONITOR’, ‘YIELD-MAPPING’ and ‘VARIABLE-RATE\
    \ TECHNOLOGY’, also\nhave prominent links with this cluster. Thus, the integration\
    \ of GPS with other smart\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n14 of 28\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as GIS and remote sensing, can boost farming productivity and cost\nefﬁciency\
    \ [116]. GPS corresponds to a navigation system that, using satellites, identiﬁes\n\
    an object’s exact position and velocity around the world and can guide directions\
    \ [117].\nAgricultural activities, such as seeding and plowing, can only be precisely\
    \ conducted using\nvehicle navigation accuracy [118].\nIn previous research, Si\
    \ et al. [118] proposed a method to enhance the accuracy of\nthe steering angle\
    \ of agricultural vehicles by combining GPS with the low-cost Micro-\nelectromechanical\
    \ System (MEMS), which improves DA. Palaniswami et al. [119] argue\nthat the joint\
    \ adoption of GPS and GIS technologies can improve sugarcane cultivation\nin coastal\
    \ lowland ecosystems, making production more precise and sustainable. Khosro\n\
    (2018) [120] developed a strawberry yield-monitoring picking cart, equipped with\
    \ a real-\ntime kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS), different types\
    \ of sensors, a micro-\ncontroller, and an inertial measurement unit to improve\
    \ the synchronization of the carts\nwith robots in harvesting and creating yield\
    \ mapping of strawberry productivity. Com-\nmonly, yield mapping on farms is performed\
    \ using GPS and variable-rate technology for\nboosting planters’ performance [121].\
    \ In addition, Thrikawakaa et al. [122] demonstrate\nthat applying variable-rate\
    \ technology through GPS in agricultural vehicles improves the\nwater content\
    \ in ﬁelds and reduces the application of fertilizers. In addition, previous\n\
    literature reviews introduce the conceptualization and potential of GPS (for more\
    \ informa-\ntion see, Rivero et al., 2021 [123]; Peng et al. (2017) [124]). Thus,\
    \ this cluster highlights the\nrole of GPS as a leading technology capable of\
    \ improving DA’s effectiveness through its\ninterconnecting capacity with other\
    \ smart technologies. Emerging technologies combined\nwith scientiﬁc knowledge\
    \ make it possible to use the strategic geographical location of\nagricultural\
    \ production, helping to make precise and targeted decisions.\n4.3.6. Image Processing\n\
    The cluster ‘IMAGE PROCESSING’ (Figure 4f) presents strong linkages with agricul-\n\
    tural management tools (e.g., ‘MACHINE VISION’ and ‘COMPUTER VISION’) that provide\n\
    data for the farmer’s decision-making. Previous literature reviews explored advanced\
    \ con-\ntrol strategies and image processing techniques in Digital Agriculture\
    \ (see Ngugi et al.\n(2021) [125], Syeda et al. (2021) [126], and Sohail et al.\
    \ (2020) [127]). Zhao et al. [128] used\nmachine vision to exploit color images\
    \ to detect immature green citrus. The use of video pro-\ncessing (i.e., machine\
    \ vision) also was analyzed by Sabzi et al. [129] to classify potato plants\n\
    and three types of weed. In this regard, machine vision was also revised by Wang\
    \ et al. [130],\ncombined with image processing as relevant tools for ‘WEED DETECTION’.\n\
    Machine learning algorithms also are linked with image processing and can assist\n\
    ‘DEEP LEARNING’ in agriculture [131]. ‘ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS’ is an ex-\n\
    ample of the Artiﬁcial Intelligence method [132] to create new forms to solve\
    \ complex\nagricultural problems based on big data. Through image processing,\
    \ several outputs\ncan be processed by machine learning and can be shown in apps\
    \ for smartphones and\ncomputers [133].\n4.3.7. Nitrogen\nThe cluster ‘NITROGEN’\
    \ (Figure 4g), like the ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘YIELD PRE-\nDICTION’ clusters, has\
    \ no stronger relations with some themes than the other clusters. As\nan important\
    \ nutrient for agricultural production, this cluster is related to crop management\n\
    (e.g., ‘MAIZE’ and ‘POTATO’), and fertilizers (e.g., ‘PHOSPHORUS’ and ‘POTASSIUM’).\n\
    The link between ‘NITROGEN’ and these themes comprises several ﬁelds of studies,\
    \ such\nas nitrogen deﬁciency [134], nutrient management [135,136], nutrient loss\
    \ [137], nutrient\nefﬁciency [138], and nutrient monitoring [139]. Therefore,\
    \ the technical agronomic back-\ndrop is preeminent in this cluster. In addition,\
    \ this theme is strongly linked to efﬁciency in\napplying nitrogen and other applications\
    \ of variable-rate technology [135,136,140].\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n15 of 28\n\
    4.3.8. Hyperspectral\nSeveral technologies are being developed and tested to analyze\
    \ plants, soil and crop\nvariables, such as optical sensors, three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) imaging, ﬂuorescence imaging,\nthermography, multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ imaging [141]. The ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’\ncluster (Figure 4h) shows that these analyses\
    \ are standing out in agriculture, mainly because\nhyperspectral imaging is a\
    \ more advanced technique than traditional multispectral imaging\nand allows the\
    \ identiﬁcation of more details of the target features [142]. Hyperspectral\n\
    images are used as an efﬁcient alternative for collecting and processing data\
    \ and creating\nan electromagnetic spectrum of agricultural ﬁelds, being a valuable\
    \ tool for monitoring,\nanalyzing, and providing more accurate detection of spatio-temporal\
    \ variations in crop\nphysiological and morphological characteristics [142,143],\
    \ such as soil attributes and soil\ndegradation. Some previous research explored\
    \ the use of multispectral and hyperspectral\ntechniques in the ﬁeld of Digital\
    \ Agriculture, focusing on high-resolution applications, and\nplant disease detection,\
    \ among others [142,144,145].\nDespite their great potential, hyperspectral images\
    \ are still little used outside the\nacademic context, but this is changing through\
    \ low-cost and mini-sized airborne hyper-\nspectral technologies that are being\
    \ used by farmers [142]. This difﬁculty occurs due to\nthe complexity of technologies\
    \ and algorithms, and the need to store and transfer data\ncollected by hyperspectral\
    \ analysis devices [146]. The signiﬁcance of the ‘HYPERSPEC-\nTRAL’ cluster shows\
    \ the volume of analyzes performed using maps and images of crops.\nThe clusters\
    \ associated with this theme demonstrate analyses related to vegetation in-\n\
    dexes and characteristics (e.g., ‘VEGETATION-INDEX’, ‘CHLOROPHYLL-CONTEXT’,\n\
    ‘CHLOROPHYLL-FLUORESCENCE’ and ‘LEAF-AREA-INDEX’). Previous research used\nhyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing to enable measurement of grapevine drought stress [147],\nidentiﬁcation\
    \ of pests and diseases [148], and assessment of seed germination [149].\n4.3.9.\
    \ Yield Prediction\nYield prediction is historically used in agriculture for farmers\
    \ to plan inputs, labor,\nproﬁtability and other issues related to agricultural\
    \ productivity. The cluster ‘YIELD-\nPREDICTION’ (Figure 4i) in Digital Agriculture\
    \ represents the evolution of predictive\nanalysis on crop yields, which in the\
    \ past was carried out by the knowledge of farmers,\nand is now carried out with\
    \ emerging technologies [98]. In this way, preharvest crop yield\nprediction helps\
    \ farmers to make better and faster decisions related to planting, fertilization,\n\
    irrigation, pruning and the harvesting of plantations [150]. It also contributes\
    \ to the entire\nsupply and consumption chain, and allows the projection of future\
    \ scenarios for food\nproduction [151].\nThis cluster appears related to be related\
    \ to few themes, but we can highlight ‘MOD-\nELING’, ‘IMAGE-ANALYSIS’ and ‘NEURAL-NETWORKS’\
    \ that are used to map and\nmodel crop data and information for future predictions.\
    \ Previous research related to crop\nyield prediction used different techniques\
    \ and technologies to collect and analyze data,\nsuch as Neural Network Techniques\
    \ [100], Unmanned Aerial System Imagery [152], Air-\nborne Optical Sensors [153],\
    \ Artiﬁcial Neural Networks [154], Machine Learning [155–157],\nHyperspectral\
    \ Imagery and Ensemble Learning [158], among others.\n4.4. Thematic Evolution\
    \ Structure\nThe evolutionary map presents the themes that have stood out over\
    \ time. The map\nwas divided into three subperiods to show the most important\
    \ themes according to the\nevolution of the ﬁeld of study. The ﬁrst subperiod\
    \ presents the main themes studied since\nthe ﬁrst mention of the term PA in 1994\
    \ in the ISI/Web of Science until the emergence\nof the Agriculture 4.0 concept\
    \ in 2011. The second subperiod covers the years 2012 to\n2017 and highlights\
    \ the terms widely discussed since the appearance of A4.0. The last\nsubperiod\
    \ (2018–2020) highlights the most current and relevant themes in the literature\
    \ in\nthe previous years. Figure 5 shows the evolutionary map of the ﬁeld of study,\
    \ the size of\nthe clusters is proportional to the number of associated documents,\
    \ while the thickness\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n16 of 28\nof the lines represents\
    \ the relationship between the themes. Continuous lines represent\nconceptual\
    \ nexus and dashed lines have non-conceptual nexus.\n4.4.1. First Subperiod (1994–2011)\n\
    In this subperiod (1994–2011) (Figure 5), we identiﬁed the ﬁrst studies that mentioned\n\
    Digital Agriculture through discussions about the use of technologies to increase\
    \ produc-\ntivity, deal with environmental variability and environmental conservation\
    \ of agribusi-\nness [71–75]. This subperiod contains studies that used hyperspectral\
    \ maps to analyze veg-\netation indices [159,160], imaging techniques [161] and\
    \ geostatistical analysis [162]. Besides,\nFigure 5 shows that technologies started\
    \ to be explored at this time, such as ‘GPS’, ‘HYPER-\nSPECTRAL’ images, and speciﬁc\
    \ analyses of soil and plants, such as ‘SOIL-FERTILITY’,\n‘NITROGEN’, ‘ELECTROMAGNETIC-INDUCTION’,\
    \ ‘PH’, ‘SOIL-COMPACTION’ and\n‘SOIL-TEXTURE’. These themes show that few technologies\
    \ were discussed and most of the\nthemes were associated with crop variability.\
    \ These themes prove that the discussions re-\nlated to Digital Agriculture mainly\
    \ represent the use of technologies such as georeferencing\nto analyze variability\
    \ associated with soil and plants.\nIn this subperiod, the ﬁrst discussions on\
    \ agroecosystems were developed [163] to\ncreate strategies to mitigate against\
    \ environmental damage. It is important to note that\nthis subperiod was one of\
    \ the most important for discussions related to sustainability, as\nresearch was\
    \ paving the way for other in-depth studies aimed at exploring the development\n\
    of resilient agriculture and the sustainable development of agribusiness. In addition,\n\
    many studies in this subperiod predicted that Digital Agriculture would be the\
    \ future of\nagribusiness [164–169].\n4.4.2. Second Subperiod (2012–2017)\nThe\
    \ second subperiod (2012–2017) (Figure 5) was characterized by a greater number\n\
    of documents associated with the consolidated PA motor themes and with emerging\
    \ A4.0\nones, as new technologies started to be discussed as the application of\
    \ UAV [170], wireless\nsensor networks and NDVI. The presence of clusters still\
    \ related to the ﬁrst subperiod, such\nas ‘NITROGEN’, ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘GPS’,\
    \ demonstrates that some themes have\nremained strong over time. In addition,\
    \ new themes emerged, such as ‘GEOSTATISTICS’\nwith a signiﬁcant number of documents,\
    \ and ‘SUSTAINABLE-INTENSIFICATION’ and\n‘CSA’ associated with the development\
    \ of resilient and sustainable agriculture, demonstrat-\ning the further expansion\
    \ and growth of the ﬁeld of study [171–173].\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the term\
    \ A4.0 gained space and came to be widely discussed\nin the literature to portray\
    \ the creation of a digital value chain in agriculture. Although\nmany terms are\
    \ discussed in this subperiod, few of them stand out in the volume of\nassociated\
    \ documents and interrelationships with themes from other subperiods. Only\nthe\
    \ ‘GEOSTATISTICS’ cluster has a strong relationship with the ‘SPATIAL-VARIABILITY’\n\
    clusters of the ﬁrst and third subperiods, highlighting the high potential of\
    \ geostatistics\nfor analyzing crop variability. In addition, ‘CSA’ has evolved\
    \ to become one of the main\nthemes of the third subperiod. It is important to\
    \ note that some themes have evolved over\ntime; however, the small size of most\
    \ clusters shows that the ﬁeld of study was still under\ndevelopment.\n4.4.3.\
    \ Third Subperiod (2018–2020)\nThe third subperiod (2018–2020) (Figure 5) presents\
    \ the most recent themes related to\nDigital Agriculture. Three clusters stand\
    \ out with a large volume of associated documents.\nThey are ‘IoT’, ‘UAV’ and\
    \ ‘CSA’, which indicates that the use of emerging technologies and\nsustainable\
    \ development are currently the most important concerns of researchers in the\n\
    primary sector. The ‘IoT’ and ‘UAV’ clusters show the potential and adaptability\
    \ of small\nsensors for any agricultural scenario, whether in large crops or in\
    \ mountainous areas that\nare difﬁcult to cultivate [11], while the ‘CSA’ cluster\
    \ shows that concern for the sustainable\ndevelopment of agriculture continues\
    \ to grow and is characterized as one of the most\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n17\
    \ of 28\nimportant discussions in the arena of smart agriculture [97,100]. In\
    \ addition, discussions\nrelated to deep learning and machine vision represent\
    \ major technological adoptions in the\nﬁeld of agriculture, and themes like ‘APPARENT-ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY’\
    \ [174],\n‘WATER-BALANCE’ [175] and ‘PROXIMAL-SOIL-SENSING’ [176] show that the\
    \ concern\nwith analyses of plants and soil remains extremely important for the\
    \ digital transformation\nof agriculture.\nA broad look allows us to see the evolution\
    \ of the ﬁeld of study and the main themes\ndiscussed over time. The third subperiod\
    \ also produces insights on future trends, because\nsome themes stand out from\
    \ the others and are anticipated to remain of paramount impor-\ntance. Besides,\
    \ other themes have emerged only in the last subperiod and may represent\nemerging\
    \ themes that can be further explored in depth in the coming years. The growth\n\
    in the number of documents in the ﬁeld of study (Figure 2) and discussions associated\n\
    with technological adoption in agriculture (Figure 4) demonstrate the commitment\
    \ of\nresearchers to the development of the primary sector and its importance\
    \ for the sustainable\ndevelopment of society and organizations.\n5. Challenges\
    \ and Opportunities\n5.1. Main Challenges\nDiscussions related to UAV, spatial\
    \ variability, yield prediction and crop model\n(Figure 3) show that there are\
    \ many challenges associated with the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies in agriculture,\
    \ such as variations in soil, climate, sustainability, cultivated\nspecies and\
    \ producer size. Government investments, export volume, agricultural and\nconsumer\
    \ culture are also factors that directly impact the way food is grown and pro-\n\
    duced, and the innovative efforts and investments dedicated to production. Developed\n\
    and emerging economies have different types of governmental investment for agricultural\n\
    production, and some are developing projects aimed at the digital transformation\
    \ of agri-\nculture in countries, like China [177], Brazil [178], Mexico [179],\
    \ Thailand [180,181] and\nothers. Despite the investment of many countries in\
    \ digital agriculture, the transforma-\ntion is still in its infancy compared\
    \ to the technological adoption in the manufacturing\nand service sectors. Technologies\
    \ widely used in other sectors such as big data, Machine\nLearning, blockchain,\
    \ simulation/mathematical modeling and augmented reality are still\nlittle explored\
    \ in agriculture. Figure 3 shows that only Internet of Things and UAV are\nprominent\
    \ technologies in the arena of agriculture.\nAmong the main challenges of digital\
    \ technology, technological adoption is among the\ncharacteristics and peculiarities\
    \ of emerging technologies, which are often complex for the\nlow level of technical\
    \ knowledge of smallholder farmers [45]. The most signiﬁcant volume\nof agricultural\
    \ production is from developing countries, and most of these farmers are\nsmall\
    \ producers with low levels of education. Under these circumstances, even language\n\
    can become a barrier to technological innovation, since most technologies are\
    \ developed\nin English, a language not spoken by small producers in developing\
    \ countries [31]. This\nbarrier for small producers favors large agribusiness\
    \ companies that have workers trained\nto use technologies and apply them to increase\
    \ large-scale production quality. In addition,\nthere is a major digital infrastructure\
    \ problem in many developing countries, which are\ngradually developing ways to\
    \ bring digital devices and applications at low cost to small\nproducers to increase\
    \ proﬁtability and production quality. This concern is evident in the\nrelationship\
    \ between smallholder farmers and CSA (Figure 4b), which also appears to be\n\
    related to discussions of gender and female management in agriculture.\nThe motor\
    \ theme of the ﬁeld of study, the Internet of Things, appears related to\nsecurity\
    \ and blockchain (Figure 4c), highlighting that technological advances bring also\n\
    complex data security and privacy issues. Concerns about information, conﬁdentiality\n\
    and data integrity are major challenges that concern farmers [182]. In highly\
    \ technological\nscenarios, these concerns increase the efforts of researchers\
    \ and practitioners in the search\nfor better encryption and security techniques\
    \ to reduce the risks of cyber-attacks and ensure\ndata security and privacy [183].\
    \ According to Zhang et al. (2020) [184], farmers are highly\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 7889\n18 of 28\nconcerned about data security and the physical requirements\
    \ for equipment and practical\ntools for data protection and distributed systems\
    \ for agricultural management. Hussein\n(2019) [183] reviews the requirement of\
    \ the computational infrastructure necessary for\ncloud storage to be effective\
    \ and secure. This and other studies highlight the concern\nwith agile software\
    \ development, data security, conﬁdentiality, and reliability to guarantee\nfair\
    \ competition, differential privacy, economic development, sustainable innovation,\
    \ and\nsocial entrepreneurship in agriculture.\nIn this sense, two major strands\
    \ of challenges can be considered: the ﬁrst strand is\nabout technical challenges,\
    \ such as the mastery and the adaptation of technological tools\nto direct them\
    \ in the best possible way for optimal gains. These challenges are evident\nthrough\
    \ technologies that are subthemes of thematic network structures, such as Machine\n\
    Learning and Deep Learning, drones, cloud computing, big data, blockchain, Artiﬁcial\n\
    Intelligence, artiﬁcial neural networks, computer vision, and others (Figure 4).\
    \ The second\nstrand is related to sustainability issues, such as the continuous\
    \ world population growth\nand global warming (mainly due to the greenhouse effect,\
    \ or gas emissions) and their\nharmful effects on agriculture [185]. Discussions\
    \ related to these challenges are represented\nby subthemes, such as food security,\
    \ conservation agriculture, climate change adaptation,\nagroforestry, vegetation\
    \ indices, resilience, and mitigation.\nMoreover, it is crucial to keep in mind\
    \ that, although many authors discuss the\ntechnological potential for promoting\
    \ sustainable development, other authors discuss\nthe paradox of sustainability\
    \ [186] by raising questions about the contradictions between\neconomic growth\
    \ and sustainable development that mainly negatively affect the low-\nincome populations\
    \ [187]. In the same perspective, the technological paradox regards the\nlack\
    \ of evidence about technological beneﬁts in terms of productivity and sustainability\
    \ of\norganizations and society [188]. These controversies between authors show\
    \ that discussions\nabout these paradoxes in agriculture are not yet sufﬁciently\
    \ developed and addressed, and\nthat future research should explore this topic\
    \ in-depth [52].\n5.2. Opportunities for Research and Practice\nThe primary sector\
    \ is crucial for human survival and is full of challenges. In this\nscenario,\
    \ the technological potential can be exploited to meet the food needs of the human\n\
    population without damaging the environment [52]. The number of studies associated\
    \ with\nsustainable agriculture shows that technological adoption can develop\
    \ resilient agriculture\nthat integrates the various (economic, environmental,\
    \ and societal) pillars. Previous re-\nsearch related to the motor theme of CSA\
    \ explored the adaptation of agricultural methods\nto develop adaptive agriculture\
    \ for plantations, landscapes and forests while addressing\nclimate issues and\
    \ food security [91,92]. Regenerative and circular agriculture explores\nways\
    \ to avoid using chemicals and to rather utilize methods to develop natural pro-\n\
    cesses to protect the soil, the environment, and people through the production\
    \ of healthier\nfoods [189]. Figure 4 highlights this through subthemes, such\
    \ as food security, soil fertility\nand related properties/topics. These subthemes\
    \ also help us identify the main crops where\nthe technology is being implemented\
    \ and discussed in the literature, such as sugarcane,\ncotton, potatoes, maize,\
    \ and grape (viticulture). Thus, the formulation and adoption of\nnew technologies\
    \ based on the circular economy principles (reduce, reuse, recycle) can\nboost\
    \ the sustainability, digitalization, and integration of agriculture with other\
    \ links of the\nagribusiness value chains, a promising opportunity for further\
    \ advancement of the ﬁeld.\nAdvances in agricultural production are crucial for\
    \ increasing production and im-\nproving logistics performance and traceability\
    \ of agricultural data in the coming years [52].\nAlthough big machines favor\
    \ agricultural monopolies, small technologies, such as sensors,\nactuators, and\
    \ drones can be developed at a lower cost and with features to assist small\n\
    farmers in collecting and analyzing crop variability data [11]. Other technologies,\
    \ such\nas smart grids can assist in the development of integrated energy networks\
    \ that facilitate\nthe management of crops at lower costs [190]. Digital Agriculture\
    \ depends on techno-\nlogical progress, and a viable path for future research\
    \ concerns strategic foresight [191]\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n19 of 28\nand analysis\
    \ of innovation capabilities [192,193] to assist in the development of techno-\n\
    logical innovations in smart agriculture. Our results are presented in the evolutionary\n\
    map (Figure 5) with the emergence of themes such as thermal imaging, red edge,\
    \ spraying\nequipment, NDVI, and technology adoption.\nDigital Agriculture can\
    \ promote and foster changes, revolutions, transformations, and\ngains, both for\
    \ society and sustainability, as well as for economic agents through the im-\n\
    provements in scale and efﬁciency of the digitization of agriculture. Within this\
    \ framework,\nif drones and IoT are more connected to companies and businesses,\
    \ CSA has an important\nimpact on inclusive and sustainable agriculture. The existing\
    \ scholarly literature presents\nseveral techniques and technological solutions\
    \ aimed at ensuring environmental protection\nand economic and social sustainability\
    \ (see Figure 5, e.g., hyperspectral, thermal imaging,\nspatial variability, proximal\
    \ soil sensing, and CSA, among others), which represent both\ntechnological and\
    \ sustainable revolutions in the primary sector. This may motivate a cycle\nof\
    \ sustainable production and consumption to transform the planet and society.\
    \ According\nto Ofori and El-Gayar (2020) [31], the main drivers for technological\
    \ adoption in agribusi-\nness are related to governance, policies, trade opportunities,\
    \ effects on human capital,\nemployment opportunities and environmental protection.\
    \ In this perspective, traditional\nagriculture is no longer sufﬁcient to meet\
    \ the demand for food, quality, sustainability\nand safety of the environment,\
    \ and a new paradigm is needed, namely the technological\nparadigm [194].\nTo\
    \ create a technological and sustainable culture, agriculture depends on the en-\n\
    gagement of various members of society, such as universities, farmers, companies,\
    \ the\ncommunity and the government. In this sense, the topic of creation of an\
    \ innovation\necosystem has been little explored in the literature and presents\
    \ an opportunity for future\nresearch. The participation of universities is crucial\
    \ for developing technologies and re-\nsearch aimed at modeling and developing\
    \ methods and techniques that assist farmers in\nmanaging agricultural processes.\
    \ Governmental programs and ﬁnancing can help in the\ndigital transformation of\
    \ agriculture in developing countries, promoting the production\nand consumption\
    \ of sustainable products, less waste and awareness of recycling. In this\nperspective,\
    \ innovation ecosystems can be explored in-depth for the digital and sustainable\n\
    transformation of the primary sector. The adoption of new technologies enables\
    \ the trans-\nformation of value chains into digital ecosystems, potentially integrating\
    \ organizations and\nstakeholders, beneﬁting each participant in the ecosystem\
    \ [195]. As in industries, in agri-\nculture, value ecosystems can directly impact\
    \ economic performance and business agility.\nTo do this, national innovation\
    \ systems can assist in transferring knowledge between\nindustries and universities\
    \ [196,197], facilitating the development of digital innovation.\nIn addition,\
    \ the number of startups focused on agribusiness is growing, and they are\ndeveloping\
    \ technologies at a lower cost that meet the needs of small and medium farmers.\n\
    All of this can help, in particular, small producers, who are responsible for\
    \ a large portion of\nthe world’s population’s food production, and who are affected\
    \ the most by the challenges\nof agricultural revolutions. Technologies, such\
    \ as big data, facilitate the collection and\nanalysis of large volumes of data,\
    \ and IoT, through its small sensors and actuators, can\nbe used in any type of\
    \ setting/environment. In addition, cybersecurity can be exploited\nto address\
    \ farmers’ fear of data protection and security. Altogether these approaches can\n\
    facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture in different scenarios and\
    \ for different\nsizes of agricultural producers.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this research,\
    \ we presented the strategic themes and the scientiﬁc evolution struc-\nture of\
    \ Digital Agriculture. With the PICOC protocol and the SciMAT software it was\n\
    possible to map and identify the strategic themes of the ﬁeld of study, which\
    \ are mainly\nassociated with technologies and sustainable development, such as\
    \ IoT, UAV, GPS, spatial\nvariability, and CSA. In addition, the evolution map\
    \ divides the literature into three subpe-\nriods of time, listing the most important\
    \ themes at each stage of development of digital\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n20 of\
    \ 28\ntransformation in agriculture. The main challenges associated with digital\
    \ technological\nadoption were identiﬁed, mainly related to the complexity of\
    \ technologies, agricultural\nculture and adaptation, data security/safety/integrity\
    \ and environmental issues [198,199].\nIn addition, we identiﬁed the main opportunities\
    \ of technological adoption and research\nin agribusiness that are strongly related\
    \ to creating a technological and smart value chain\nto increase the productivity,\
    \ quality, and proﬁtability of agricultural production, while\npromoting and ensuring\
    \ economic, societal, and environmental sustainability. Thus, we be-\nlieve to\
    \ have covered a major gap in the existing scholarly literature related to the\
    \ evolution\nof the digitalization of agriculture and its strategic themes over\
    \ time.\nLimitations and Further Research\nDespite its contribution, methodological\
    \ rigor and high-quality, as well as trans-\nparency, and reproducibility, this\
    \ research has limitations that should be properly acknowl-\nedged. This study\
    \ explored only documents from the Web of Science database, and we\nanalyzed only\
    \ the thematic structures of the motor themes, and as such other themes\nshould\
    \ be addressed in future works. It is important to keep in mind that agriculture\n\
    directly impacts socioeconomic conditions and environmental sustainability. Thus,\
    \ a more\ncomprehensive qualitative analysis could be realized in terms of the\
    \ implications of Digital\nAgriculture for sustainability and societal development.\
    \ The role of emerging technologies\nto promote food security and the impact of\
    \ food production on society and organizations\nneed to be explored. Future research\
    \ can explore in-depth agricultural management prac-\ntices focused on CSA, sustainable\
    \ and lean agriculture to identify and analyze sustainable\nproduction paths.\
    \ In addition, scenarios and frameworks for smart agriculture imple-\nmentation\
    \ should be explored. Future research could map the ﬁeld of study, focusing\n\
    on speciﬁc techniques, applications, and technologies such as Big Data, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelli-\ngence, blockchain, Internet of Things, autonomous robots, NDVI, yield\
    \ prediction, image\nprocessing, etc. Future studies could explore each theme\
    \ and subtheme not covered in\nthis research to discover hidden and emerging themes\
    \ in the ﬁeld of study, such as those\nrelated to subsectors of PA, like PH, CEA,\
    \ VF, PAF and Precision Aquaculture/Fisheries.\nMoreover, further additional analyses\
    \ could be performed, stratifying ﬁndings based on\nthe speciﬁc study design of\
    \ the investigation (original research, overview/review, etc.)\nand gradating/assessing\
    \ its strength of evidence. Innovation ecosystems need also to be\nexamined by\
    \ involving organizations, government, and universities to integrate and digi-\n\
    tize processes. Future works can also explore technological and sustainability\
    \ paradoxes\nto identify the real potential of technologies in agriculture and\
    \ the challenges related to\ntheir contradictions to better understand whether\
    \ human decisions about food production\nare moving in the right direction or\
    \ are causing an ecological collapse unrecoverable on\nthe planet.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  explanation: 'This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities
    and challenges associated with implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
    in agriculture. The paper provides a detailed examination of the current state
    of IoT in agriculture and identifies key areas where IoT can have a significant
    impact. Specifically, the paper focuses on the potential benefits of IoT in enhancing
    crop monitoring and management, improving water conservation, and increasing productivity
    through automation.


    The authors argue that IoT has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing
    farmers with access to real-time data and insights that can help them make more
    informed decisions about their operations. For example, IoT sensors can be used
    to monitor soil moisture levels, crop health, and weather conditions, providing
    farmers with the information they need to optimize irrigation, apply fertilizer,
    and protect their crops from pests and diseases.


    However, the authors also acknowledge that there are a number of challenges that
    need to be addressed before IoT can be widely adopted in agriculture. These challenges
    include the need for reliable and affordable connectivity, the development of
    стандарты for data sharing and interoperability, and the need to address security
    concerns.


    Despite these challenges, the authors believe that IoT has the potential to transform
    agriculture and make it more sustainable, productive, and profitable.'

    \ attention all over the globe. It has \ntransformed the agricultural field and\
    \ allowed farmers to compete with \nmassive issues they face. The aim of this\
    \ paper is to review the various \nchallenges and opportunities associated with\
    \ the applications of internet of \nthings in agricultural sector. This research\
    \ makes use of secondary sources \nthat have been gathered from existing academic\
    \ literature such as journals, \nbooks, articles, magazines, internet, newsletter,\
    \ company publications and \nwhitepapers. Applications reviewed in this research\
    \ are about crop sensing, \nmapping and monitoring the croplands pattern, managing\
    \ and controlling \nwith the help of radio frequency identification and real-time\
    \ monitoring of \nenvironment. Some of the challenges that were taken into consideration\
    \ for \nreviewing the applications of internet of things are software complexity,\
    \ \nsecurity, lack of supporting infrastructure and technical skill requirement.\
    \ \nComplexity in the software has to be rectified in order to support the IoT\
    \ \nnetwork. Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly for \nimproving\
    \ the farming, production and quality of the crop. Security is the \nmajor threat\
    \ in the IoT applications. Security has to be enhanced through \nproper access\
    \ control, data confidentiality and user authentication. \nTechnical skill is\
    \ required for farming to enhance the organizational \nabilities and to perform\
    \ the farming functions, solving problems and more. \nProper supporting infrastructure\
    \ can be developed with proper internet \navailability and connectivity. Some\
    \ of the opportunities were taken for \nreviewing the applications of internet\
    \ of things are low power wireless \nsensor, better connectivity, operational\
    \ efficiency and remote management. \n \nKeywords: Internet of Things, Software\

    \ factors influencing the productivity in \neach stage like cultivation, harvesting\
    \ and storage of post \nharvesting. The Internet of Things (IoT) is referred as\
    \ the \nnetwork of network typically associated with large \nnumber of sensors\
    \ connected through information and \ncommunication infrastructure to provide\
    \ the value added \nservices. It is one of the hot concepts emerged since the\
    \ \n1960s. It is referred as one of the hard-core technologies \nof the IT industry\
    \ of the new generation (Cai, 2012). The \nultimate aim of this IoT is to create\
    \ the better world for \nhuman species, where the objects around us understand\
    \ \nthe comments and hence act accordingly without any \ninstructions explicitly.\
    \ IoT is highly on the rise and it has \nbeen observed to control areas and bring\
    \ them \ncompletely under its influence. It has the tendency to \nobtain powerful\
    \ computing tools via cloud computing. It \nis pointed as an intelligent technology\
    \ which includes \nsensing, identification and intelligence. It can be used in\
    \ \npattern identification areas like sensing, collection and \nprocessing of\
    \ the information and communication. \nControlling of all these operations has\
    \ attained through \nremote smart devices connected to the internet. Further \n\
    the whole operations will be performed by means of \ninterfacing sensors, Zigbee\
    \ modules or Wi-Fi, camera \nwith micro-controller and raspberry pi (Devi and\
    \ \nMeenakumari, 2013). In this effect, microcontrollers, \nmicroprocessors, actuators\
    \ and sensors are some of the \nphysical devices which directly communicate with\
    \ the \ninternet. They work by using the gateway of IoT. This \nentire infrastructure\
    \ is called as the infrastructure of IoT. \nThe smart farm embedded with the systems\
    \ of IoT is \ncalled as the connected farm as it could support the \ndevices in\
    \ a wide range from diverse device \nmanufacturers of agricultural field. In this\
    \ sense, the \nconnected farms can provide more services of intelligent \nagriculture\
    \ based on shared knowledge of the expert. At \nlast, the IoT impact has given\
    \ good results and it plays \nan efficient role to extend into latest technologies\
    \ like \ngrid and cloud computing in many different sectors. \nFinally, this paper\
    \ also aims to investigate some \nchallenges and opportunities associated with\
    \ the IoT \napplication in the agricultural field.  \nReview of Literature \n\
    Usage of IoT in Various Agricultural Applications \nSensing of crop (Water, Moisture\
    \ and Temperature) \nA study done by Bangera et al. (2016) examined the \nIoT\
    \ based smart village. In smart farming, the content of \nmoisture in the soil\
    \ acts as the major factor to determine \nthe growth of the plant. Soil moisture\
    \ sensor is resistive \nsensor used to change the soil resistance between two\
    \ \nprobes that depends on content of water. Apart from \nthese, temperature and\
    \ humidity is one of the main \nenvironmental parameters worked with the climatic\
    \ \nchange, topography, types of soil and vegetation   \n(Dursun and Ozden, 2011).\
    \ Crop planting time, tile ring \ngrowth and winter safety are some of the processes\
    \ \nwhich are closely related to the soil temperature. In this \nway, the temperature\
    \ sensor has given the specific idea \nabout the coolness and heat content variation\
    \ in the soil. \nSensor based automated irrigation system with IoT has \nbeen\
    \ analyzed by Kansara et al. (2015). The temperature \nand humidity sensor senses\
    \ the changes in temperature \nand humidity and it also has the tendency to give\
    \ an \ninterrupt signal to the micro-controller devices. A low \ncost internet\
    \ of things network for contamination \ndetection in drinking water systems using\
    \ raspberry pi \nwas analyzed by Anam and Devender (2015). The \ntemperature of\
    \ water can be measured by the water \nsensor when dipped into the water.  \n\
    Kumar and Ravi (2016) studied about the automation \nof irrigation system based\
    \ on Wi-Fi technology and IoT. \nThe soil moisture sensor and temperature sensor\
    \ has \nplayed an important role in developing an automation to \nsupply water\
    \ for irrigation system and home gardening \nin fields of farming. Cloud IoT based\
    \ system of \ngreenhouse monitoring has been investigated by   \nKeerthi and Kodandaramaiah\
    \ (2015). Temperature, light, \nrelative humidity and soil moisture sensor have\
    \ \nintegrated to demonstrate the greenhouse monitoring \nsystem. Crop sensing\
    \ has been done accurately by using \nthe IoT and this has further created the\
    \ positive impact \non the agricultural field.  \nManaging and Controlling (Use\
    \ of RFID) \nA study done by Kang et al. (2015) examined an \neffect of IoT based\
    \ electronic sow feeder on productivity \nof swine farms. Radio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) \nis commercial technology in the system of IoT. This \ntechnology has\
    \ been applied in the raising industry by \nthe IoT based production management\
    \ systems. RFID \ntag has played a potential role to control the amount of \n\
    feed. Tongke (2013) focused the study on the smart \nagriculture based on cloud\
    \ computing and IoT. \nAccording to him, the RFID and IoT, has helped to build\
    \ \nplant factory and it also plays an important role to realize \nthe automatic\
    \ control production in the agricultural \nsector. In fact, the RFID, sensor and\
    \ GPS worked \ntogether for information sensing in the process of \nproduction.\
    \ Sarkar and Chanagala (2016) surveyed IoT \nbased digital agricultural monitoring\
    \ system with their \nimpact on optimal resource utilization. RFID has helped\
    \ \nto build the device for the process of sensing the \nparameter in the agriculture\
    \ and it further sends signal to \nthe internet in an effective manner. In this\
    \ effect, the IoT \nbased RFID has improved the quality of agriculture \nproducts\
    \ by managing and controlling the products. \nBarakat (2016) has pointed that\
    \ the RFID’s and GPS \npoints can be embedded in agricultural field and it can\
    \ \nbenefit from the collected information they provide. \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan\

    \ devices can then be \nproceeding and the final results are used to perform an\
    \ \nautomated task via Wi-Fi connection (Buckely, 2006).  \nAccording to Zhao\
    \ and Wang (2014), RFID tracing \napplication with IoT has helped to manage and\
    \ control \nthe information in the supply chain value of \nagricultural products.\
    \ IoT can make use of RFID \ntechnology for scanning EPC tags on the items and\
    \ \nhence it has achieved the automatic identification and \ninformation sharing\
    \ successfully. The authors also \npointed out the RFID as the most critical technologies\
    \ \nin the IoT. It can be also predicted that the RFID has \nused to achieve intelligent\
    \ identification, monitoring, \nremote control and positioning in the agricultural\
    \ \nproduction (Qin et al., 2015). \nMapping and Monitoring the Croplands Pattern\
    \ \nA study done by Jaishetty and Patil (2016) examined \nIoT sensor network based\
    \ approach for agricultural field \nmonitoring and control. The solution of remote\
    \ \nmonitoring has played a significant role to monitor in \nreal time through\
    \ some of the remote devices such as \ntablets and mobiles. Ultrasonic waves have\
    \ been used \nwith IoT to monitor the soil quality and levels of ground \nwater\
    \ in agricultural field. The optimal sensor methods \nof placement have used to\
    \ monitor the environmental \nchange and wireless sensor networks have played\
    \ a \npotential role to monitor the patterns of cropland Table 1. \nParameswaran\
    \ and Sivaprasath (2016) studied about \narduino based smart drip irrigation system\
    \ using IoT. \nCrop has continuously monitored by using PC host. LCD \nhas also\
    \ played an efficient role to improve the method \nof cultivation and hence it\
    \ leads to better productivity \neffectively. System hardware associated with\
    \ the IoT \ncreated the significant impact on monitoring and \ncontrolling system\
    \ of smart agriculture. Channe et al. \n(2015) pointed that the real time monitoring\
    \ properties of \nIoT has helped to maintain the health of soil intact by \napplying\
    \ the required fertilizer amount. In fact, the \nanalysis of soil moisture by\
    \ sensor also has helped to \napply water in necessary areas. Zigbee and GPS \n\
    technologies also pave way to monitor the cropland \npattern in an effective manner.\
    \  \nAutomatic intelligent equipment and remote control \nproduction devices played\
    \ an efficient role for farmers to \nmonitor the farmland information without\
    \ leaving home. \nIn this effect, the agricultural IoT has related to some of\
    \ \nthe field such as weather monitoring, automatic \ngreenhouse controlling,\
    \ intelligent control system of \nplanting \nindustry, \ntraceability \nof \n\
    food \nsafety, \nenvironmental monitoring etc (Wu et al., 2015). \nAccording to\
    \ Paventhan (2013) IoT also has aimed to \nextend internet to distributed devices\
    \ in large numbers \nby defining the communication protocols. \nReal-Time Monitoring\
    \ of Environment (Using \nWireless Technology) \nA study done by Pavana and Padma\
    \ (2016) designed \na low cost system for real time monitoring of water \nquality\
    \ parameters in IoT environment. The IoT has the \ncapability to revolutionize\
    \ the water industry as more of \nthe innovative technology has connected to web.\
    \ The \nwater quality monitoring through online mode has \nacquired \nmuch \n\
    attention \nworldwide. \nConverging \ntechnologies for smart environments and\
    \ integrated \necosystems of IoT has been investigated by Vermesan and \nFriess\
    \ (2013). Monitoring of soil moisture, vibrations, \ndensity of earth to detect\
    \ the dangerous spatterns in land \nconditions have been achieved by the wireless\
    \ \ntechnology of IoT. In addition to these, the monitoring \nof variations of\
    \ water level in dams, rivers and \nreservoirs are also analyzed using the IoT\
    \ in an \neffective manner. Wine quality enhancing, green \nhouses, half courses,\
    \ meteorological station network \nand compost are also achieved in agricultural\
    \ sector by \nusing the wireless technology of IoT. \nAdvantech (2015) pointed\
    \ out that the real-time \nremote monitoring and management has been achieved\
    \ \nby the IoT wireless technologies successfully. In real-\ntime monitoring system,\
    \ the information can be remotely \nchecked through mobile phones, computers etc.\
    \ In this \nsense, the distributed systems, nutrients etc. across the \ngreenhouses\
    \ can also be managed in an efficient way   \n(Li and Guo, 2014; Abdul Aziz et\
    \ al., 2009). It also has \nprovided different workers with different authority\
    \ level. \nGetting real-time information through e-mail alerts and \nSMS are also\
    \ achieved in the smart agriculture system. \nGreenhouse \nwireless \nnetwork\
    \ \nmonitoring \nand \nmanagement using internet of things has been analyzed \n\
    by Jagdale and Mali (2016). The authors pointed that the \nwireless network technology\
    \ has monitored the light \nintensity that was incident in the field greenhouse\
    \ area. \nIn fact, monitoring and controlling of green field \nenvironment has\
    \ played an important role in production \nof crops and this has further maximized\
    \ the activity of \nphotosynthesis. Better infield monitoring of cropland has\
    \ \nachieved only by means of IoT wireless technology \nwhen compared to other\
    \ technologies (Doknic, 2014).  \nChallenges of Applying IoT in Agriculture \n\
    Software Complexity \nA study done by Soumyalatha and Hegde (2015) \nexamined\
    \ the application, issues, challenges and \narchitecture of IoT. Scalability,\
    \ self-configuration, \ninteroperability, complexity of software, storage volume,\
    \ \ninterpretation of data, security and personal privacy, fault \ntolerance and\
    \ energy-optimized solutions are some of the \nchallenges associated with the\
    \ IoT (Perera et al., 2015; \nBorgohain et al., 2015; Whitmore et al., 2015; \n\
    Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011). In fact, the software \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed\

    \ \n \n135 \nsystems in smart objects work with minimal resources \nand the software\
    \ infrastructure is needed support the \nnetwork and hence it also required the\
    \ server to support \nnetworks smart objects on the back ground.  \nA study done\
    \ by Pande and Padwalkar (2014) \nexamined the internet of things. The software\
    \ complexity \nand data interpretation are referred as the main challenges \n\
    of IoT in agricultural sector. The systems of software in \nsmart objects should\
    \ have to function with minimal \nresources as in the conventional embedded systems\
    \ \n(Ashton, 2009). In fact, the fault tolerance also has \npossessed the great\
    \ challenges and it requires redundancy \non several levels depending on various\
    \ conditions. \nBalamurugan et al. (2016) studied about applying \nIoT to improve\
    \ food and farming technology. User-\nfriendly software has paved the way for\
    \ the big data for \nsmall farms with the creative usage. In particular, the \n\
    software, actuators, sensors and technologies of energy \nharvesting are directly\
    \ contributing to the IoT \ndevelopment  (Guang et al., 2011). Software complexity,\
    \ \nspatiality and dynamics are some of the factors which are \naffecting quality\
    \ and production of crop in higher level \n(Venkataramana and Padmavathamma, 2012).\
    \  \nA study done by Madakkam et al. (2015) examined \nthe Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). Hardware, middleware and \npresentation of software of IoT have the capability\
    \ to \ncreate \nthe \nnegative \nimpact \non \nthe \nagriculture \n(Jayavardhana\
    \ et al., 2013). Patil et al (2012) has \noverviewed the internet of things and\
    \ cloud computing \nfor agriculture. Complexity, spatio-temporal variability \n\
    and diversity are some of the characteristics features \nrelated to agriculture\
    \ need to be considered in \ndeveloping the right kinds of services. In addition\
    \ to \nthese, the actuators, sensors, software and location \ntechnology (GPS),\
    \ wireless communication and RFID \ntechnology (Shao and Li, 2009) are some of\
    \ the \ntechnologies which have contributed to the development \nof IoT in many\
    \ sectors. In this sense, understanding and \noperating the software seems to\
    \ be more complex in \nsome of the sectors like agriculture.  \nSecurity \nThe\
    \ study done by Mehta and Patel (2016) examined \nIoT based smart agriculture\
    \ research opportunities and \nchallenges. The IoT has connected with more devices\
    \ \ntogether and it also has provided the decentralized \nenergy points for malware\
    \ creates a negative impact \non the smart agriculture. It also has become the\
    \ main \nchallenge of IoT in agricultural sector. Less expensive \ndevices which\
    \ are in compromised locales are more \nsubject to the process of tampering (Fangquan,\
    \    \n2012; Sun et al., 2008) In addition to these, more \nsoftware layers, APIs,\
    \ middleware integration and \nmachine to machine communication are some of the\
    \ \nterms which are creating the complexity and new risks \nof security in higher\
    \ level. \nWang and Liu (2014) focused some of the application \nof IoT in agricultural\
    \ means of production supply \nmanagement. The internet of things application\
    \ in the \nstage of agricultural product sale has reflected in the \nform of security,\
    \ statistics and validity monitoring.  \nWEF (2015) analyzed industrial internet\
    \ of things by \nunleashing the potential of connected products and \nservices.\
    \ Security and privacy of IoT has created both \nthe positive and negative impact\
    \ in agricultural sectors. \nThe securities are raising an increased vulnerability\
    \ to \nattacks, espionage and data breaches driven by increased \nsharing of data\
    \ and connectivity (Osborn and Charlie, \n2014; Elfrink, 2014; Shankland and Stephen,\
    \ 2014). \nFinally, it can be predicted that the security and \ninteroperability\
    \ are referred as the two biggest hurdles of \nimplementing the IoT in agricultural\
    \ sectors.  \nKumar and Patel (2014) have surveyed the internet of \nthings with\
    \ security and privacy issues. Front-end \nsensors and equipment, network and\
    \ back-end of IT \nsystems are referred as the security threats of IoT. Safety\
    \ \nmanagement of code resources and operator replacement \nare some of the terms\
    \ associated with the back end of IT \nsystems (Liu and Yang, 2011; Jiang and\
    \ ShiWei, 2010; \nZhou et al., 2012). In fact, the security of IoT system has\
    \ \nsome major standards such as access control, \nauthentication of user, data\
    \ confidentiality and \nanytime availability (Abomhara and Koein, 2014; \nZhao\
    \ and Ge, 2013). These are further associated with \nthe back-end of IT systems\
    \ also creates an impact on \nthe development of agriculture.  \nFernandes et\
    \ al. (2016) have evaluated the internet of \nthings with security challenges\
    \ and future scope. They \npointed that the confidentiality, integrity, availability\
    \ and \nauthentication are some of the factors which are linked \nwith the security\
    \ issues. Additionally, the common \nworms jumping, organized crime and cyber\
    \ terrorism are \nsome of the security threats associated with the IoT \nfurther\
    \ create an impact on agricultural field (Farooq et al,., \n2015; Roman et al.,\
    \ 2011a; 2013b). \nTechnical Skill Requirement \nChikaire et al. (2015) pointed\
    \ that the capacity \nbuilding is one of the essential key to survival of \nagricultural\
    \ extension. The technical skill requirement is \nneeded for farming and the lack\
    \ of operating skills \ncreates an impact on the overall performance in field\
    \ of \nagriculture. The capacity building has focused on \nenhancing the abilities\
    \ of an organization to perform the \nfunctions of farming, solve problems and\
    \ also deal with \nthe need of development (Rivera, 2000).  \nJacobs and Hart\
    \ (2012) studied about the skill \ndevelopment in rural areas. Skill based technical\
    \ change \nalso has evolved to increase demand for high skilled \nlabor across\
    \ different working environment. Motor \nskills, cognitive skills and interactive\
    \ skills are the three \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed Yusoof Ismail / Journal\
    \ of Computer Science 2018, 14 (2): 132.143 \nDOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2018.132.143\
    \ \n \n136 \nstages of skills demand for the operator in the farming. \nIn this\
    \ effect, the ability of education tends to be the \nprimary problem for the farmers\
    \ from adopting new \npractices and effective technologies.  \nMenon et al. (2012)\
    \ have assessed the technical \nmanpower requirements in agriculture sector in\
    \ India. The \ntechnical manpower has expected to be requiring in a high \nnumber.\
    \ This will continue to be insufficient during the \nhorizon with time. The authors\
    \ pointed that the technical \nmanpower in sector of agriculture has played a\
    \ vital role \nin achieving the self-sufficiency in the grain production of \n\
    food (FCCI, 2007; Kao and Lee, 1998). In fact, there is a \nshortage of technical\
    \ manpower in agriculture field at \nvarious levels especially related to IoT.\
    \  \nPodder and Kuntagod (2016) studied some smart \nservices with designing internet\
    \ of things solutions to \naspire the smart nations. Most of the growing \neconomies\
    \ lack the resources of finance, manpower, \nskills related to technology and\
    \ access to the latest \ntechnology \nnecessary \nfor \nstrengthening \nthe \n\
    infrastructure. Interoperability, ensuring security of \ndata and sourcing the\
    \ required skills are some of the \nfundamental issues rising in emerging economies.\
    \ \nRose et al. (2015) have overviewed the internet of \nthings with several challenges.\
    \ The scope of IoT \nchallenges has not been unique to industrialized \ncountries.\
    \ Infrastructure readiness, incentives of market \nand investments, technical\
    \ skill requirements and the \nresources of policy have been identified as some\
    \ of the \nchallenges linked with the IoT in many sectors. \nInteroperability\
    \ has created the significant influence on the \nIoT with the economic impact\
    \ beyond technical aspects. \nLack of Supporting Infrastructure \nBidua and Patel\
    \ (2015) studied about internet of \nthings and cloud computing for agriculture\
    \ in India. \nSmart grid, traffic systems etc. have been identified to \nhave\
    \ supporting infrastructure which is far from being \nready for internet of things\
    \ in agricultural field (Yan-e, \n2011; Channe et al., 2015; Bo and Wang, 2011).\
    \ In fact, \nthe IoT has offered the tremendous potential to innovate \nin the\
    \ field of agriculture. In India, internet availability \nand connectivity seems\
    \ to be the major challenge and \nadoption of IoT becomes difficult for farmers\
    \ due to lack \nof supporting infrastructure.  \nSharma et al. (2016) analyzed\
    \ the technical \nassessment of IoT for Indian agricultural sector. Smart \nmetering\
    \ and smart grid infrastructure of IoT are lacking \nin the agricultural field.\
    \ Furthermore, the infrastructure \nmodernization cost and maintenance seems to\
    \ be a great \nchallenge of IoT in farming (Lee et al., 2013).  \nPundir et al.\
    \ (2016) analyzed the future directions \nand challenges of internet of things.\
    \ Lack of information \ninfrastructure facilities of IoT in farming has created\
    \ the \nnegative impact in productivity. The rural farming areas \nare not advanced\
    \ in terms of overall infrastructures. In \nfact, the unanticipated resource of\
    \ development has \ndiminished the abilities of the individual to add new \nfunctionality\
    \ related to core.  \nRoshan and Ray (2016) analyzed some of the \nchallenges\
    \ and risk to implement IoT in smart homes \nwith respect to an Indian perspective.\
    \ Smart power grid, \nsmart drainage or system of sanitation, supply of smart\
    \ \nwater, are some of the supporting infrastructure which \nare far away from\
    \ being ready to use in Indian \nagricultural area (Jin et al., 2014; Datta et\
    \ al., 2014). In \nparticular, the centralized infrastructure of IoT to support\
    \ \nanalytics have required in the agriculture field to attain \nthe specific\
    \ tasks (Gubbi et al., 2013).  \nOpportunities Associated with the Application\
    \ of \nIoT in Agriculture \nLow Power Wireless Sensor \nA study done by Chen (2012)\
    \ examined the \nchallenges and opportunities of IoT. Low power wireless \nsensor\
    \ is one of the main opportunities associated with \nthe application of IoT. Low\
    \ power sensors are needed \nreplacement of battery over their lifetimes. The\
    \ design of \nlow power transmitter should be considered for low \npower sensor\
    \ node and hence it attains the greatest \nimpact in the agricultural sector.\
    \ Low power wireless \nless sensor networking of IoT has achieved high success\
    \ \nover other technologies (IEC, 2014; Sen, 2009). It has \nthe capability to\
    \ cover an area of only a small dozen \nmeters. In this sense, the low energy\
    \ consumption of \nsensors is act as the main key to support the independent \n\
    battery powered devices in a longer flow. This has \nhelped to reduce the cost\
    \ of maintenance simultaneously. \nAnusha and Shobha (2015) analyzed the design\
    \ and \nimplementation of wireless sensor network for precision \nagriculture.\
    \ Recently, low cost and low power wireless \nsensor technology seems to be well\
    \ suited to replace \nwires as the medium of communication in most of the \napplications\
    \ of agriculture (Gutierrez et al., 2014).   \nMore and Nighot (2016) has reviewed\
    \ the wireless \nsensor network for agriculture. The advancement of \nwireless\
    \ sensor networks and reduction of size has \nincreased the WSN application chances\
    \ in agricultural \nfield. The wireless sensor has consumed low cost and it \n\
    has the ability to withstand the resistance towards the \ncurrent successively\
    \ (Barath et al., 2016). The ability of \ndata gathering and remote sensing are\
    \ closely related to \nthe low power wireless sensor.  \nBetter Connectivity \n\
    Machine to machine is referred as the autonomous \nnetworking to connect large\
    \ populations with efficient \nusage of energy. Better connectivity of IoT devices\
    \ may \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed Yusoof Ismail / Journal of Computer Science\

    \ efficient outcome in agricultural sector. \nInternet connectivity seems to be\
    \ vital to the solutions of \nIoT. Wireless links have played an effective role\
    \ in \ncovering huge distances at reasonable costs (Miazi et al., \n2016). Better\
    \ internet connectivity has enabled to push \nthe data onto the cloud and it also\
    \ helps to visualize the \ndata using the mobile and other electronic devices.\
    \ IoT \nseems to be more popular and easy to use in almost \nevery field (Raigonda\
    \ et al., 2016; Domingo, 2012; \nZhang et al., 2013). GSMA (2015) has analyzed\
    \ the \nagricultural Machine to Machine (M2M) as a platform of \nexpansion. Better\
    \ connectivity of IoT has enhanced the \nsustainability of business in higher\
    \ level. Cellular M2M, \nshort-range (Wi-Fi, Zigbee and Ethernet), satellite and\
    \ \nfixed networks and power line are some types of M2M \nconnectivity significantly\
    \ linked with IoT. In some areas, \nthe lacks of distribution of channel and limited\
    \ \nconnectivity access have created an impact on the \nagriculture areas (OECD,\
    \ 2016). M2M connectivity \nservices have helped the farmers to improve the \n\
    efficiency of farming operations. High bandwidth fiber \nconnectivity also has\
    \ enabled the communication with \nlow latency which keeps the farming area more\
    \ active. \nOperational Efficiency \nOperational efficiency has achieved the application\
    \ \nof IoT and it can be called out by the enhanced usage of \nenergy with effective\
    \ infrastructure of IoT. The IoT \npower has tackled the issues of environment\
    \ which lies \nin its ability to gather data through analytics. It also \ndrives\
    \ the smarter decisions about operational efficiency, \nstrategy of business and\
    \ the allocation of resources. The \nIoT has the opportunity to capture data which\
    \ optimizes \noperational efficiency and reducing the impact of \nenvironment\
    \ in a higher level (Wind, 2016). According \nto Schimek (2016), the IoT implementation\
    \ has \nimproved the analytics, efficiency and predictive \nmaintenance. Sensor\
    \ and wireless technologies of IoT \nhas played a potential role to increase the\
    \ efficiency and \nhence it provides an accessible vehicle network to its \ncustomers.\
    \ Oracle (2015) pointed out that the agribusiness \nperformance has been improved\
    \ by using big data and \nIoT. The solutions of IoT and big data have improved\
    \ \nforecasting and efficiency of an operation. It also leads to \nimproved decision\
    \ making. Timely scheduling equipment \nmaintenance and minimizing the usage of\
    \ energy has \nenabled the greater operational efficiency in agricultural \nsectors.\
    \ In this effect, the operational efficiency of \ninformation and technology has\
    \ often difficult to prove. \nRomeo (2016) analyzed the current status and trends\
    \ \nenabling smart farming through the IoT. Low cost and \nhigh volume of sensor\
    \ paves a way to attain the high \noperation efficiency in the farming area. \
    \ \nRemote Management \nA study done by Yin (2017) examined the \nimplementation\
    \ of IoTs in agriculture industry in China. \nAlarm management, remote control\
    \ and expert system \nare closely connected with each other as it has helped to\
    \ \nattain the high production in the agriculture area. Real-\ntime surveillance\
    \ is referred as the main functions in the \nagricultural site. Remote monitoring\

    \ \n \n139 \nPropositions of the study are as follows: \n \nP1: Software complexity\
    \ stands as a challenge in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things\
    \ \nwith specific reference to agricultural sector \nP2: Security stands as a\
    \ challenge in implementing the \napplications of internet of things with specific\
    \ \nreference to agricultural sector \nP3: Technical skill requirement stands\
    \ as a challenge in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things \nwith\
    \ specific reference to agricultural sector \nP4: Lack of supporting infrastructure\
    \ stands as a \nchallenge in implementing the applications of \ninternet of things\
    \ with specific reference to \nagricultural sector \nP5: Low power wireless sensor\
    \ stands as an opportunity \nin implementing the applications of internet of \n\
    things with specific reference to agricultural sector \nP6: Better connectivity\
    \ stands as an opportunity in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things\
    \ \nwith specific reference to agricultural sector \nP7: Operational efficiency\
    \ stands as an opportunity in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things\
    \ \nwith specific reference to agricultural sector \nP8: Remote management stands\
    \ as an opportunity in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things \n\
    with specific reference to agricultural sector \n \nFrom the above literature,\
    \ it is evident that software \ncomplexity, lack of supporting infrastructure,\
    \ security \nand technical skill requirement are some of challenges \nassociated\
    \ with internet of things applications with \nrespect to agricultural sector.\
    \ It was noticed that \ncomplexity of software, dynamics and spatiality affects\
    \ \nthe crop’s quality and production. However, it was also \nnoted that lack\
    \ of operating skills has created an impact \non the overall farming performance\
    \ thus technical skill is \nmainly needed for farming. Lack of supporting \ninfrastructure\
    \ has created the negative impact in farming \nproductivity. \nRemote \nmanagement,\
    \ \noperational \nefficiency, better connectivity and low power wireless \nsensor\
    \ are some of the opportunities associated with \ninternet of things applications\
    \ with special reference to \nagricultural sector. In terms of opportunities,\
    \ low energy \nconsumption of sensors support the independent battery \npowered\
    \ devices for longer time. Machine to machine \nconnectivity services assist the\
    \ farmers to enhance the \nefficiency of operating in terms of farming. Maintaining\
    \ \nthe timely scheduling equipment allowed greater \noperational efficiency especially\
    \ in agricultural sectors. \nRemote management has permitted the user to monitor\
    \ \nthe irrigation condition in the field. Applications of \ninternet of things\
    \ can be used in many areas related to \nagricultural field namely sensing of\
    \ crop, real-time \nmonitoring of environment, managing and controlling \n(use\
    \ of radio frequency identification) and mapping and \nmonitoring the croplands\
    \ pattern. Temperature sensor \nand soil moisture sensor plays a key role in introducing\
    \ \nan automation system in farming field that is sensing of \ncrop. Internet\
    \ of things based radio frequency identification \nhas enhanced the quality of\
    \ agricultural product by \nmanaging and controlling. Global positioning system\
    \ and \nZigbee technologies in the internet of things have paved the \nway for\
    \ monitoring the pattern of cropland. At the same \ntime, it was also clear from\
    \ the above literature that, with \nthe help of internet of things technologies,\
    \ real-time remote \nmonitoring and management can be achieved.  \nDiscussion\
    \ and Conclusion \nInternet of things in agricultural field has become one \n\
    of the most remarkable developing fields in machine-to-\nmachine space. In the\
    \ present scenario, conservationists, \nranchers and farmers require a method\
    \ to efficiently \nadopt and conserve resources. Better and efficient way to \n\
    perform \nthis \nby \nutilizing \nmachine \nto \nmachine \ncommunication and actionable\
    \ data which makes the \nongoing data collection very affordable and simple. \n\
    Internet of things had transformed the agricultural sector \nand enabled farmers\
    \ to compete with massive issues they \nface. This research collects data from\
    \ the second handed \nor secondary sources. Secondary data were gathered \nfrom\
    \ different existing academic literature from reputed \njournals, books, newsletters,\
    \ magazines, whitepapers and \nso on. The main purpose of this paper is to review\
    \ the \nvarious challenges and opportunities associated with the \napplications\
    \ of internet of things in agricultural sector. \nSome of the challenges were\
    \ taken into consideration for \nreviewing the applications of internet of things\
    \ are \nsoftware complexity, security, lack of supporting \ninfrastructure and\
    \ technical skill requirement. It is clear \nfrom the literature that, complexity\
    \ in the software has to \nbe rectified in order to support the IoT network. \n\
    Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly \nfor improving the farming,\
    \ production and quality of the \ncrop. Security is the major threat in the IoT\
    \ applications. \nSecurity has to be enhanced through proper access \ncontrol,\
    \ data confidentiality and user authentication. \nTechnical skill is required\
    \ for farming to enhance the \norganizational abilities and to perform the farming\
    \ \nfunctions, solving problems and more. Better supporting \ninfrastructure can\
    \ be developed with proper internet \navailability and connectivity. Some of the\
    \ opportunities \nwere taken for reviewing the applications of internet of \n\
    things \nare \nlow \npower \nwireless \nsensor, \nbetter \nconnectivity, \noperational\
    \ \nefficiency \nand \nremote \nmanagement. Low cost and low power wireless sensor\
    \ \ntechnology are appropriate one to replace wires as \ncommunication medium\
    \ in the agricultural sector. Better \ninternet connectivity services assisted\
    \ the farmers in \nenhancing the farming operations efficiency. Internet of \n\
    things can collect data which optimize operational \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed\

    \ \n \n140 \nefficiency and can minimize the impact on environment \nto a great\
    \ extent. Remote system and wireless sensors \nwill monitor the parameters and\
    \ manage the level of \nwater, temperature and humidity. Some of the applications\
    \ \nof internet of things which can be adopted in agriculture \nindustry are reviewed\
    \ in this research they are crop \nsensing, mapping and monitoring the croplands\
    \ pattern, \nmanaging and controlling with the help of radio frequency \nidentification\
    \ and real-time monitoring of environment.  \nRecommendations for Future Research\
    \ \nIntervention of internet of things in development can \nenhance the efficiency\
    \ that is achieved similar impacts \nlevels with fewer resources or/and improve\
    \ effectiveness \nthat is maximize the impact with similar existing \nresources\
    \ levels. Moreover, it can be recommended that \nwith advanced development, interventions\
    \ of internet of \nthings can assist in enhancing public policy, research, \n\
    monitoring and estimating the programs and basic \ndelivery of service across\
    \ a wide range of various fields. \nThis research will be an eye-opener for future\
    \ \nresearchers, academicians, practitioners to know about \nthe challenges and\
    \ opportunities associated with the \napplications of internet of things in the\
    \ agricultural \nsector. In future, other investigators can expand this \nresearch\
    \ in a quantitative way of approach. On the basis \nof research framework, future\
    \ researchers can derive the \nproposed \npropositions \nto \ntest \nand \nexperiment.\
    \ \nPropositions \nderived \nin \nthis \nresearch \ncan \nbe \nhypothetically\
    \ tested by collecting primary data from \nrespondents belonging to agricultural\
    \ sector and can \napply statistical tools on gathered data by the future \nresearchers.\
    \ Future work can be conducted quantitatively \nfor investigating the challenges\
    \ and opportunities \nassociated with the applications of internet of things in\
    \ \nagricultural sector and variables selected for challenges \nare software complexity,\

    are presented. • Widely used sensors in agricultural deployments are surveyed.
    • The potential of interoperable software use and adoption of IoT is discussed.
    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular
    IoT wireless technologies. Wireless technology Wireless standard Network type

    40 mW/4 W 128 bit As can clearly be seen in Table 2, IoT wireless communications
    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

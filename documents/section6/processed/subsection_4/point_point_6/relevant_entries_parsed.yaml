  explanation: Encryption is used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
    or theft by scrambling it in a way that makes it unreadable to those without the
    proper encryption key. Secure communication protocols like TLS (Transport Layer
    Security) and DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) are used to establish encrypted
    communication channels between devices, ensuring that data transmitted over those
    channels remains confidential and protected from eavesdropping or interception.
  extract_1: Using encryption to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access is
    important, as well as using secure communication protocols such as TLS and DTLS
    to set up encrypted communication channels between devices.
  extract_2: Both TLS and DTLS establish an encrypted communication channel to protect
    the confidentiality of transmitted data from eavesdropping or interception.

    influence the sustainability performance of logistics industries – a Chinese case
    study. Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain, 6, 100094.
  explanation: 'The provided text contains a review of 59 research papers on how the
    Internet of Things (IoT) can contribute to circular business models (CBM). The
    research aims to explore the relationship between IoT and CBM, and identify how
    IoT can be used to support the implementation of circular principles within businesses.
    The study considers 4 key IoT capabilities (tracking, monitoring, optimization,
    and design evolution) and 6 CBM categories (Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop,
    Virtualize, and Exchange) proposed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The analysis
    found that IoT can support the implementation and success of CBM, particularly
    the Loop and Optimize models. IoT''s ability to promote joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use in these models.


    The review also highlights that that while IoT can have positive impacts on circular
    economy practices, it also poses a number of obstacles for its application across
    different businesses. These include the lack of standardized data processing methods,
    limited availability and diversity of industrial data, security and privacy concerns,
    and the relatively high investment costs associated with IoT implementation, particularly
    for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the authors recommend
    further research to address these challenges and explore the full potential of
    IoT in enabling circular economy principles across various industries.'
  extract_1: IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’ dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’.
    Papers displaying Loop usually rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while
    optimization and design evolution are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling,
    remanufacturing, and repairing, the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions
    can exploit information for faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption
    products, they can be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri
    et al., 2018). As a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle
    components of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al.,
    2019). In line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate
    environmental criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from
    an IoT-based product life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable
    design and development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and
    Soares, 2017).
  extract_2: Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly related to IoT-enabled
    ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization capabilities,
    as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes and agents
    such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying potential failures,
    and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing products (Venkatesh
    et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally, based on the demands
    of the production and consumption of resources, managers could monitor and Optimize
    production rates and the use of sensors as well as algorithms would enable them
    to automatically intervene in processes to reduce intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi
    and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination
    of cloud computing and machine learning provides potential for complex and integrated
    data-driven process manufacturing models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher
    et al., 2020).

    such as its potential to enable new circular business models or disrupt existing
    ones.'
  relevance_evaluation: '**Exceptionally relevant** - The paper thoroughly examines
    how IoT can contribute to circular economy business models. It covers aspects

- explanation: 'Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are a promising enabling
    technology for 6G wireless networks, as they can be used to improve coverage and
    capacity, reduce interference, and enhance security. However, RIS also has some
    challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize its potential.


    One challenge with RIS is the need for accurate channel estimation. In order to
    effectively reflect signals, RIS needs to know the channel conditions between
    itself and the transmitter and receiver. This can be difficult to estimate in
    practice, especially in dynamic environments. Another challenge with RIS is the
    need for low-power operation. RIS devices are typically small and battery-powered,
    so they need to be able to operate with minimal power consumption. This can be
    difficult to achieve, especially when RIS is used to reflect high-power signals.


    Finally, RIS is still a relatively new technology, and there are some challenges
    associated with its deployment and operation. For example, RIS devices need to
    be carefully placed and configured in order to achieve the desired performance.
    Additionally, RIS can be susceptible to interference from other wireless devices,
    which can degrade its performance.'

    and challenges associated with implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
    in agriculture. The paper provides a detailed examination of the current state

    impact. Specifically, the paper focuses on the potential benefits of IoT in enhancing
    crop monitoring and management, improving water conservation, and increasing productivity

    The authors argue that IoT has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing
    farmers with access to real-time data and insights that can help them make more
    informed decisions about their operations. For example, IoT sensors can be used
    to monitor soil moisture levels, crop health, and weather conditions, providing
    farmers with the information they need to optimize irrigation, apply fertilizer,
    and protect their crops from pests and diseases.


    However, the authors also acknowledge that there are a number of challenges that
    need to be addressed before IoT can be widely adopted in agriculture. These challenges
    include the need for reliable and affordable connectivity, the development of
    стандарты for data sharing and interoperability, and the need to address security

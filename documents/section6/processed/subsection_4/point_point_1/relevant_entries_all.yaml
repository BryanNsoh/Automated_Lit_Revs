    Location: New Delhi, India SECTION I. Introduction The world is tending towards
    new emerging technology for their day-to-day work and it becomes necessary to
    trend them to agriculture also. Major developing countries have agriculture as
    a major contributor to their economy. When we specifically talk about India''s
    Economy, Indian agriculture contributes 18% to Indian''s gross domestic products
    (GDP), and it provides 50% of the employment to the Indian workforce shown in
    fig. 1. Fig. 1. Role of agriculture in the Indian economy Show All Many researchers
    have been done in the field of agriculture. IoT provides an environment where
    animals, people, or objects are managed together with a unique identifier that
    is capable of transmitting data over the internet without the need for human-computer
    or human-human interaction. Nowadays, the IoT-based devices are beginning to impact
    the vast range of industries from health, manufacturing, communication, and also
    the agriculture in order to increase the performance in all sectors. The IoT and
    allied devices have the capabilities of the basic communication infrastructure.
    This technology also provides a high scope of services ranging from remote; or
    local data acquisition, decision making, user interface, cloud-based intelligent
    information analysis and make agriculture operations automate. These capabilities
    can transform the agriculture industry to a higher level. Engineers and researchers
    around the world are bringing forward distinct techniques and frameworks and from
    these suggestions, huge variations of devices/equipments are available to monitor
    and fetch information regarding different stages of crop production. And to meet
    the market request and many leading manufacturers are now providing a large range
    of robots, communication devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [4], sensors,
    and other machinery to provide sensed data. Most of the recently published articles
    either show limited focus on various IoT based architecture or provide no insight
    for the use of these devices in food quality and other future aspects. This article
    helps engineers and researchers to implement the Internet of Things-based devices
    and technology to obtain the preferred smart agriculture. And the second phase
    of the article will focus on the role of various technologies and equipments like
    robots, sensors, UAVs being used in precise agriculture. The third phase of this
    article focuses on the challenges of IoT based devices in agriculture and the
    last phase contains the conclusion. SECTION II. Major Application of IoT in Agriculture
    Through implementing IoT technologies with the latest sensing devices in agriculture,
    the traditional farming is transformed fundamentally. Currently, by integrating
    these technologies and devices into agriculture, the agriculture will rise to
    a higher level than was previously unimaginable. Through smart agriculture, IoT
    also helps to provide the solution to many issues in traditional farming. Fig.
    2 shows the applications, services, and sensors for smart agriculture. Fig. 2.
    Applications, services, and sensors for smart agriculture Show All A. Soil Quality
    and Sampling The first step in farming is the soil preparation, sampling, and
    examination of soil to obtain field-specific information like fertility, humidity,
    nitrogen level, etc. The main aim of soil quality testing is to find the nutrients,
    and nitrogen levels in the soil, so that further protective measures can be taken
    accordingly. The major factors that are very important to analyze nutrition level
    consist of soil type, fertilizers used, cropping history, topography, irrigation
    level, etc. The soil mapping can be used to sow a different variety of crops in
    a specified field. Nowadays, many agro manufacturers provide a wide variety of
    sensors and toolkits which can help farmers to track the soil quality by using
    these devices. These advanced systems can allow a farmer for monitoring water
    holding capacity, soil properties, absorption, and pollution in the soil. In 2009,
    a satellite named as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) was launched to help
    the farmers, which provides the global soil moisture map for everyone and two
    days of interval. B. Field Irrigation For smart agriculture various controlled
    irrigation methods are available such as sprinkler and drip irrigation are nowadays
    recommended to solve the problem of wastage of water. The crop quantity and quality
    effected very badly due to water shortage. The traditional irrigation methods
    need to be changed by acquiring the IoT-based technologies. The (CWSI)-based irrigation
    management (2) is one of the IoT-based techniques which is helpful to increase
    the crop efficiency. Fig. 3 shows the IoT deployments in agriculture fields. Fig.
    3. IoT deployment in agriculture field Show All C. Use of Fertilizers A fertilizer
    is a composition of nutrients that would be either a natural or chemical substance.
    The fertilizers help in the growth and crop fertility. The major macronutrients
    needed by plants are phosphorus (P) helps in the growth of root, fruit, and flower
    development; nitrogen (N) for leaf growth and potassium (K) helps in the growth
    of stem and movement of water [5]. The excessive use of these fertilizers may
    result in a financial loss as well as it harms the soil and the environment. The
    crop can absorb less than the half of these fertilizers and the rest of the amount
    of these fertilizers emitted to the atmosphere. The fertilizers under smart agriculture
    can be precisely estimated and the required amount of fertilizers will be sprayed
    in the fields. The fertigation [6] and chemigation [12] [13] are the advantages
    of IoT-based technology. In these techniques, fertilizers and pesticides will
    be applied using the irrigation method. D. Crop Disease Many techniques such as
    automatic VRT chemigation [19] and vehicle precise spray are mainly used for fertilization
    and disease treatments. Also, the recent development in agricultural robots provides
    new solutions for crop disease detection and monitoring. When an agricultural-robot
    is equipped with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    the robot can able to deal with the pest problem more precisely. These IoT-based
    robots have major advantages that can decreases the overall expenditures and can
    help to restore the natural climate as well. SECTION III. Literature Review S.

    combines data analytics and IoT in smart agriculture. They have also suggested
    future trends and challenges in technological innovations. A. Khanna and. Kaur
    [1], proposed precision agriculture using the Internet of Things. They focus on
    the existing challenges to be faced while performing agriculture activities. Tzounis,
    A., Katsoulas, N., Bartzanas, T., Kittas, C. [3], proposed a research in recent
    advancement and future challenges of IoT in agriculture. Cloud and IoT solutions
    introduced in agriculture were discussed in detail. Deployment of the wide range
    of sensors in the agriculture field and future and ongoing challenges in IoT were

    which are available right now. K. Benke, and B. Tomkins, [15], presented research
    on food production systems using the controlled-environment farming, and vertical-farming.
    The vertical farming focuses to raise production, and reducing the environmental
    footprint. A. Theopoulos, A. Boursianis, A. Koukounaras, and T. Samaras [2], had
    done a research on wireless sensors networks using real-time measurement in hydroponics
    cultivation. The proposed infrastructure is achieved by Enhanced ShockBurst Protocol.

    a critical review on the IoT-based devices/robots in Agriculture 4.0. The authors
    have covered all the possible sensors that are helpful for a precision agriculture.
    SECTION IV. Research Gap After analyzing the literature survey, the following
    research gap has been identified: Traditional farming has a lack of communication,
    automation, real-time forecast, and lack of reach. Very few data analysis techniques
    or tools are available which unable to provide the accurate results. The adoption
    of new and advanced Internet of based-devices in agriculture may increase the
    productivity and preciseness. The Internet of Things-based devices can provide
    the accurate data, and real-time field surveillance. SECTION V. Major Technologies
    Used in Smart Agriculture Most of the tasks in smart farming are nowadays usually
    done by using heavy machinery like tractors, harvesters, and robots which support
    remote sensing technology either fully or partially. In precision farming, the
    tasks like the sowing of seeds, fertilization, irrigation of agricultural land,
    and harvesting of crops are being done by vehicles that contain GPS and GIS features.
    The benefit of a precision agriculture depends upon the accuracy of data collection
    that can be done either by a multifunctional imaginary device using a remote sensing
    platform or by the various sensors deployed for their specific purpose. So, the
    use of major technologies like GIS/GPS-based devices or multipurpose sensors may
    increase the precision of agriculture. Fig. 4 shows the use of major technology
    used in smart agriculture. Fig. 4. Major technologies used for smart agriculture
    Show All A. Wireless Sensors in Agriculture All the majorly required equipments
    needed for smart agriculture is easily available in the market. The wireless sensors
    are key elements when it comes to collecting the data from the agriculture field.
    The wireless sensors either may be used stand-alone or they may be integrated
    into advanced agriculture tools and other machinery. Table I shows major wireless
    sensors used in agriculture fields according to their working procedures and requirement.
    Table I. Show the various sensors used in smart agriculture B. Harvesting Robots
    During the production process, harvesting is the most important stage. This is
    the final stage that is carried out to get crop output. In some crops, harvesting
    is done one time and end of the session and in other crops, it may be done weekly
    or daily basis harvesting. The harvesting of the crop must be done at the right
    time otherwise it affects the crop production. If the harvesting is done early
    or late then the production is affected. Many researchers have done their research
    on the use of harvesting robots in agriculture [20] [22] [27]. They use the robots
    to detect the shape, size, and color of fruits, and then the robots can perform
    the harvesting process depends the data provided to them. Agribots is semi-automatic
    and specialized robots and performs the specific task. They can collect the fruits
    from the crop plants easily. Fig. 5 shows the different Agribots used in agriculture.
    Fig. 5. Different agribots used in agriculture Show All C. Various Important Smartphone
    Apps for Agriculture Table II shows the various Smartphone apps used for agricultural
    applications. Table II. Show the various smartphone apps used in agricultural
    applications SECTION VI. Implementation of Sensors in the Field Fig. 6. Implementation
    of sensors in the field Show All To solve the problem of irrigation and maintaining
    the temperature in the field the above-proposed framework is designed. The temperature
    sensor measures the temperature or provides variations in the temperature and
    it monitors the temperature of the field. The moisture sensor provides the details
    of moisture of soil by which farmers can determine the need for water required
    by the crop. The RFID technology is also used with the sensors as a result of
    which helps to identify that the crop needs variation in temperature and the needed
    water. With the help of RFID, the sensors data like the variation in temperature
    and need for water then can be sent to the receiver or to the end-user as shown
    in fig. 6. SECTION VII. Automated Sprayer Drone for Spray Pesticides in Agriculture
    Field A. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Agriculture Nowadays, the IoT has developed
    to higher levels and it is used in many industries such as farming (fishing, poultry,
    etc.). When the communication is concerned in agricultural fields the communicating
    technologies have their restrictions due to limited range and limited bandwidth
    and also the latest communication is very hard to implement in rural areas. In
    this situation, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are the alternative solution.
    As UAVs can communicate across the entire field through the wireless sensors spread
    over the field. The UAVs can easily collect the data from the fields for further
    processing. The UAVs are also known as Drones, they have equipped with a camera
    of high-resolution, multiple sensors, and can fly through thousands of hectares
    of fields. B. Objective Using necessary components assemble a sprayer drone. To
    propose a mechanism for controlling, spraying, and other parameters like monitoring
    water tank status, spraying speed control, and fixing sprayer at a particular
    location in the field. To spray pesticides and chemicals aerially. C. Method Used
    The Automatic Controlled Aerial Sprayer Drone (ACA SD) consists of two main units:
    The Quadcopter and the Spraying Mechanism. 1. Drone Quadcopter The initial components
    for assembling a Quadcopter are the Flight Controller Board(FCB), Electronic Speed
    Controller(ESC), DC Motors, Global Positioning System(GPS), Wireless Transceiver,
    Propellers, Frame, and Batteries, etc. Fig. 7. Block diagram of automatic controlled
    aerial sprayer drone (ACASD) Show All The movement, positioning, and lifting of
    the drone are managed and maintained by Flight Controller Board(FCB). The FCB
    can be easily programmed to handle a variety of sensors like barometer, GPS, gyroscope,
    accelerometer, and other components such as motor, etc. The functions of the Flight
    Controller (fig. 7) of the Quadcopter are as follows: 2. Attitude Controller The
    drone will hover at the desired altitude at first, then switch to Altitude Hold
    mode, which will keep it there until it is turned back. A current altitude barometer
    is used to determine the current altitude. Additional sensors, like as sonar,
    can be utilized to get more precise height readings. 3. Stability Controller Sensors
    such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope keep the drone stable throughout the
    program. 4. GPS Controller It''s only utilized in self-contained mode. In this
    mode, the FCB uses a feedback mechanism to compare stored GPS data with acquired
    GPS to modify the speed of the motors so that they can navigate the prescribed
    course. After arriving at the final destination, the drone is securely landed.
    5. Motor Speed Controller The speed of the motors can be changed to fulfill the
    desired task based on variations in the values of various sensors. Fig. 8. Spraying
    mechanism of drone Show All 6. Spraying Mechanism of Drone The spraying mechanism
    (Fig. 8) is mostly made up of an Arduino UNO microcontroller that has been configured
    to do a variety of tasks. A 250ml tank with a water pump is also included. A splitter
    is linked to this water pump, which spits the insecticide out to the two nozzles
    connected at opposing ends, allowing for spraying. It also has a motor driver
    circuit for controlling spraying speed and a pesticide level indicator circuit
    with a buzzer for sensing when the pesticide is running low. 9. Pump Control-ON/OFF
    It is used to turn on and off the water pump that sprays. This is accomplished
    by delivering a 5V control signal from Arduino to the motor driver circuit. 10.
    Spraying Speed Control A PWM signal is sent to the motor driver IC to increase
    spraying speed. The speed of spraying can be regulated using the ton time of this
    signal. 11. Water Tank Status Using a water level sensor, the tank''s state will
    be monitored. If the pesticide level falls below the threshold, say 25ml in the
    prototype, a control signal is sent to the Arduino, which activates the buzzer.
    As a result, once the operator hears the buzzer, he can land the quadcopter and
    refill the batteries. SECTION VIII. Challenges Various researchers have done their
    research regarding the impact and usage of the IoT in agriculture. The research
    challenges occur in IoT-based agricultural applications. This study has identified
    a few unfolded IoT-based agricultural challenges. Protection and prevention of
    devices and sensors used in IoT-based agriculture from heavy-rain, winds, fire,
    and extreme weather conditions. A secure transmission of information with high
    ratability and energy-efficient network-based setup. The selection of appropriate
    IoT based devices technologies and tools for the implementation of smart agriculture.
    A highly secure and reliable security mechanism must be proposed for each IoT
    device during design and implementation in smart agriculture. Optimization and
    resource utilization is a major concern in IoT-based smart farming. Mobility and
    cost analysis is also one of the major challenges in smart agriculture. SECTION
    IX. Conclusion The farming in India majorly depends upon the weather conditions.
    Traditionally, the farmers used their knowledge and experiences for performing
    farming practices. But due to a lack of accurate knowledge, it''s become very
    critical to analyze the weather conditions. Smart/precision agriculture can not
    only provide the accurate knowledge about the weather conditions but the Internet
    of things-based devices can help them to monitor the farm and also notify the
    upcoming diseases/pests in the agricultural land. By using sophisticated sensors,
    the farmer can able to determine the soil health, the exact time for sowing of
    the crop, irrigation of crop, pest/disease control, and harvesting of crops. The
    Internet of Things-based devices make the farmer independent and by using those
    farmers can increase the overall productivity of the crops without loss. Moreover,
    a high initial cost is required to invest in sensors, drones, and bots for their
    purchasing and setting up in the field. These sensors require time to time maintenance,
    so the farmers should be familiar with these technologies or may have taken some
    training before setting IoT-based devices in the field. The future crop production
    techniques must be better, smarter, and efficient enough so that the food demand
    of the growing population should be satisfied. The IoT based devices must be used
    to transform the traditional agriculture into smart agriculture. To implement
    the smart agriculture various IoT-based architectures, wireless sensors, UAVs,
    new communication technologies must be used. A summary of current and future technologies
    is provided to help engineers and researchers. Based on this we can conclude that
    by using IoT based devices in agricultural lands, they may help in the enhancement
    of productivity and reduce the risk involved in agriculture. It is possible to
    obtain effective pesticide spraying through successful implementation. Human exposure
    to highly harmful pesticides can be avoided. This method can also be employed
    in areas where laborers are scarce. Pesticide spraying can be sped up to cover
    a wide area in a short amount of time. It is possible to avoid encounters with
    venomous snakes, which can be found in fields regularly. Environmental contamination
    can be reduced because spraying is done from a lower altitude. SECTION X. Future
    Scope The quadcopter''s weight lifting capacity can be improved by increasing
    the number of motors, propeller size, or motor rpm. Increasing the battery capacity
    can extend the flight time. The carrying capacity of pesticides can be improved
    by increasing the tank''s size. A larger area can be covered by using a larger
    number of nozzles grouped in an array. The spraying angle may be regulated for
    precise spraying. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I am very thankful to the Department of Computer

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Kanjirapally, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the Republic of India, analogous to the importance
    of oxygen to human beings. It not only forms the economic backbone of the nation
    but also drives individual livelihoods and sustains our populace. A substantial
    58% of our population is directly dependent on agriculture for employment. However,
    despite concerted efforts, including the Green Revolution, the agricultural sector''s
    contribution to India''s GDP remains remarkably low, standing at a mere 17% of
    the total economy. This discrepancy is primarily attributable to the suboptimal
    yield of agricultural produce in the country. One critical factor influencing
    agricultural growth is irrigation. India''s agricultural sector''s diminished
    contribution to GDP and the substantial dependence of its populace on this sector
    translate to low per capita income levels. Consequently, irrigation practices
    often involve excessive watering, with fields sometimes being inundated for extended
    periods or irrigated unnecessarily. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of rainfall
    occasionally results in farmers irrigating their fields just before a rain shower,
    a seemingly minor issue that can have significant repercussions. Excessive moisture
    in the soil can lead to soil clogging, impeding the exchange of oxygen and nitrogen
    gases crucial for plant health and yield. Addressing these challenges necessitates
    an affordable solution, which this paper aims to propose. Our objective is to
    automate the irrigation process by integrating a system that anticipates and adapts
    to imminent rainfall events. The system continuously monitors soil temperature
    and moisture levels, making realtime adjustments to maintain optimal conditions
    for crop health. Additionally, it incorporates a rainfall prediction feature,
    which assesses the likelihood of rain in the near future before activating the
    irrigation pump. This approach ensures that water levels in the fields remain
    within the desired range, mitigating soil clogging and promoting plant growth.
    Of noteworthy significance is the system''s reliance on solar-based energy, eliminating
    the need for fossil fuel consumption and reducing carbon emissions. This eco-friendly
    attribute not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also ensures
    the system''s continuous operation, regardless of energy availability. In conclusion,
    our research endeavors to present a scholarly solution to enhance agricultural
    productivity in India by automating irrigation processes. By optimizing water
    management through realtime monitoring and predictive capabilities, our system
    has the potential to revolutionize Indian agriculture while aligning with environmental
    sustainability goals. SECTION II. Literature Overview The Internet of Things (IoT)
    represents a convergence of various technological components, including microprocessors,
    memory devices, input/output peripherals, sensors, and actuators, all interconnected
    to facilitate the exchange of information. Contrary to its name, IoT does not
    exclusively rely on the internet for connectivity; it can function within any
    network capable of transmitting data. In this section, we delve into prior research
    and systems, examining their methodologies and outcomes. Arunava Chaterjee and
    Soumyajit[VI] Ghosh proposed a novel approach employing photovoltaic (PV) modules
    to power essential components like storage batteries, water pumps, soil moisture
    sensors, and DC motor-based pumps. Their system featured an Atmega-based controller,
    and its operation was contingent on solar radiation levels and soil moisture content.
    Significantly, the emphasis lay on energy efficiency through the use of PV motors.
    Prachi Subhash Kulkarni and Jitendra Pajendra[VII] introduced a system centered
    around continuous soil moisture monitoring using moisture sensors. When the soil''s
    moisture level dipped below a certain threshold, a relay triggered the activation
    of a water pump, harnessing available energy resources. Their primary focus resided
    in the automation of irrigation systems, optimizing water usage. HGCR Laksiri,
    HAC Dharmagunawardhana, and JV Wijayakulscreriya[11] undertook the development
    of a machine learning platform employing neural networks for weather forecasting
    and crop irrigation management. Sensors measuring moisture, humidity, and temperature
    provided input data, which was then transmitted to a local processing unit, a
    wireless communication module, and ultimately to a cloud server. Here, machine
    learning models processed and analyzed the data, which was subsequently relayed
    through a web application to end-users. These users had the autonomy to decide
    whether to activate irrigation pumps, thereby controlling water levels in their
    fields, based on the insights provided by the system. Yan Zhao, Yong Long Yu,
    Jun Kang, and Aong Chey Zhag[III] introduced an IoT architecture featuring a collection
    and control layer, which incorporated NB-IOT sensors, PLC-controlled pumps, PH
    sensors, electric ball valves, and other irrigation equipment. The network transmission
    layer was responsible for uploading sensor data to the cloud via NB-IOT. Subsequently,
    data underwent computation and analysis in the terminal application layer before
    being stored in a database and sent back to the PLC through DTU for precise irrigation
    adjustments. This system offered continuous access to historical and realtime
    data, utilizing graphical representations to highlight patterns and changes. A
    proposed autonomous irrigation and monitoring system by Vaishali S, Suraj S, Vignesh
    S, Divya S, and Udayakumar[V] featured a Raspberry Pi, water pump, and various
    sensors for moisture and temperature monitoring. Communication was facilitated
    through mobile phones. This system exhibited an intricate understanding of crop
    or plant water requirements at various growth stages, enabling the precise management
    of water resources. In summary, these previously explored systems and methodologies
    present diverse approaches to address the challenges of efficient irrigation and
    agriculture management through IoT. They underscore the importance of automation,
    energy efficiency, data analysis, and user control in optimizing crop yield, conserving
    water resources, and ultimately contributing to the sustainability of agriculture.
    SECTION III. Proposed System Components Required for Our System Microcontroller
    We employ the NODEMCU ESP8266 microcontroller for our operations. This versatile
    device can be programmed using the Arduino IDE and is equipped with WiFi ESP8266,
    enabling seamless connectivity to wireless networks. It boasts compatibility with
    both analog and digital devices through its Analog (AO) and Digital (D0-D7) pins,
    facilitating a wide range of interfacing possibilities. Additionally, it supports
    serial communication, allowing connections to serial devices such as LCD displays,
    accelerometers, gyroscopes, touch screens, and more, making it a versatile and
    essential component for our projects. Soil Moisture Sensor The soil moisture sensor
    is a three-pin digital device. Two pins supply power, while the third serves as
    the output. Using this sensor is straightforward: insert it into the soil, and
    based on a predefined threshold, it will detect moisture levels and output either
    HIGH or LOW signals. A HIGH signal corresponds to a 5V potential at the output
    terminal, while a LOW signal indicates OV potential. Solar Panel Solar panels
    comprise Photovoltaic cells, which have achieved up to a 50% energy conversion
    rate from solar to electric energy in scientific experiments. However, commercially
    available solar panels typically exhibit efficiencies ranging from 15% to 20%.
    In our system, cost constraints, especially for farmers with limited resources,
    lead us to employ a 15% efficient solar panel. The provided figure illustrates
    the average solar power generation over a 12-hour duration when the panel receives
    sunlight, quantified in watts per square meter. Battery Charging and Protection
    In standalone solar setups, solar regulators, or charge controllers, are essential.
    They primarily serve to prevent battery overcharging (by disconnecting solar panels
    when batteries are full) and excessive discharge (by disconnecting loads as needed),
    optimizing battery efficiency. Motor We opt for a DC motor instead of an AC motor
    in our system to avoid the need for an inverter, which would otherwise increase
    the system''s cost by converting DC to AC power. Relay A relay functions as an
    electrical switch, operating on electromagnetic induction. When the relay circuit
    detects fault current, it activates an electromagnet, generating a magnetic field.
    This magnetic force then engages the motor in response to input signals from the
    microcontroller. Weather Api Weather APIs are open-source code components seamlessly
    integrated into various systems, enhancing daily activities. They empower online
    news sources to deliver local weather updates, enable travel websites to furnish
    realtime conditions in different destinations, assist home automation systems
    in optimizing energy consumption through temperature monitoring, and aid smartphone
    apps in planning outdoor activities based on up-to-the-minute forecasts. These
    APIs find versatile applications across a spectrum of services, enriching user
    experiences with timely weather information. Fig 1 Circuit diagram of smart irrigation
    system Show All SECTION IV. Methodology The proposed system represents a sophisticated
    approach to efficient and sustainable irrigation, driven by the careful management
    of resources and data-driven decision-making. Central to this system''s operation
    is the DC pump, a crucial component that ensures crops receive the required moisture
    for optimal growth. Power for this pump is primarily supplied by a PV (photovoltaic)
    module, tapping into the abundant energy resource of sunlight. When the PV module
    generates an excess of power, it directly powers the pump, ensuring a seamless
    and eco-friendly irrigation process. However, in cases where the PV module''s
    power production falls short of the pump''s demands, the system is designed to
    access stored energy from a connected battery system. This smart power management
    strategy guarantees uninterrupted irrigation even when solar energy generation
    is insufficient, contributing to overall system reliability. The triggering of
    the DC pump is closely tied to soil moisture levels, monitored continuously by
    a soil moisture sensor embedded in the ground. When this sensor detects that the
    soil moisture has dipped below a predefined threshold, it sends a signal to the
    system''s microcontroller, signaling the need for irrigation. The microcontroller,
    a central decision-making component of the system, subsequently engages with external
    data sources through a realtime API hosted on a cloud server. This external data
    primarily consists of meteorological information, offering precise weather forecasts
    for the system''s operational area. The key aim of this data retrieval is to ascertain
    whether there is an imminent precipitation event, specifically during the next
    anticipated interval. This step is pivotal in avoiding unnecessary irrigation
    when natural rainfall is anticipated. If the API indicates impending rain, the
    microcontroller prudently decides not to activate the DC pump, allowing nature
    to fulfill its role in watering the fields. This strategic decision prevents over-irrigation,
    which can lead to waterlogging and soil degradation, conserving both water resources
    and energy. However, in scenarios where the weather forecast does not predict
    rainfall in the immediate future, the microcontroller proceeds to activate a relay,
    in turn starting the DC pump. The pump proceeds to irrigate the field until the
    soil moisture levels reach the predetermined upper threshold. These threshold
    values for soil moisture have been carefully set at a minimum of 60 gm-3 and a
    maximum of 90 gm-3, striking a balance between efficient irrigation and preventing
    soil saturation. U th is the threshold value for the moisture, SoC(t) is the State
    of charge of battery, I(0) is the initial charge, i(t) is the current going to
    the battery (either+ve,−ve or 0) , Ppv is the power supplied by the pump, P Pump
    is the power consumed by the pump, M cont is the moisture content of the of the
    soil in real time, P batt is the power of battery, where negative state indicated
    charging and positive indicates supply, P is the precipitation in the area, t
    is the time of the current state. Soc(t)= ∫ t o i(t)dt+I(0) View Source Fig 2:

    conservation due to rainfall check The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB
    (Developed by Mathworks primarily for mathematical computing but with addition
    of simulink, it can also work on graphical multi domain simulation), we sourced
    our datasets from open sources such as National solar radiation database (NSRDB)(.gov)
    and National center for medium range weather forecasting, a national agency for
    weather forecasting under ministry of earth science,Government of India. We primarily
    sources total precipitation over the month of June and soil moisture over layer
    1(0-0.1m) and soil moisture over layer 2(0.1-0.35m) below ground. We chose 30°
    N, 75.36° E as the location whose dataset we picked to run our simulation. We
    calculated energy consumption for two systems; in the first system the irrigation
    system will be triggered automatically as soon as the moisture in the layer one
    and layer two heads below the threshold, on the flip side in the second system
    the system would trigger the pump when the soil moisture level would go below
    the threshold and it is not going to rain the next clock cycle of the soil moisture
    check system SECTION V. Results We ran two simulations for the given data set
    and found that with precipitation check for this particular data set i.e. june
    2014, 30°N 75.36°E electricity consumed was 30% less as compared to irrigation
    without rain check. Fig 4: Code used for simulation of our circuit Show All Fig
    5: Comparison of consumption of electricity Show All Estimation Of Saving Of Diesel
    Cost Since we replaced diesel energy system with solar energy system, we save
    a significant amount of Diesel. Using estimation technique and data of energy
    consumed over 15 days, we interpolate the amount of energy consumed during a year.
    Using general thumb of rule of 0.4L of Diesel consumed for every Kwh of energy
    consumed we calculate the amount of diesel and cost of diesel conserved by one
    farmer. Considering 70% irrigation using groundwater and one pump for every 5
    farming families and a nuclear family of four we calculate the annual amount of
    Diesel and cost of Diesel Saved too. Assuming 1.2$ per Litre Cost of Diesel [Mumbai,
    India, March 2023]. Table 2: Guesstimation for saving of diesel Estimation of
    saving of ground water Our system used 30% less ground water during our estimation
    period of June 2014. Now estimating two crop cycles and an estimate of 900 Liters
    of water per Kg of food[X] crop required for each crop cycle we estimate the conserved
    ground water. Assuming 342 million tons of food produced during a year we calculate
    estimated amount of ground water saved. Table 3: Guesstimation on amount of water
    conserved SECTION VI. Conclusion The paper presents a study whose primary energy
    source is PV module which is already a renewable source. We used NODEMCU for as
    a microcontroller for the system and with the addition of precipitation check
    we were able to save 30% energy for our defined data set in the simulation. IF
    our system replaced all diesel Pumps In India we can save 2 Billion dollars in
    cost. Our system if implemented in India can save upto 64.7 trillion Liters of
    water. This proves that we can save energy and at the same time prevent water
    logging in the field which also yields in better health of the plantation. This
    proves that we can save energy and at the same time prevent water logging in the
    field which also yields in better health of the plantation Authors Figures References

  description: 'Like natural ecosystems, the cyber ecosystem comprises a variety of
    diverse participants - private firms, non-profits, governments, individuals, processes,
    and cyber devices (computers, software, and communications technologies) - that
    interact for multiple purposes. Today in cyberspace, intelligent adversaries exploit
    vulnerabilities and create incidents that propagate at machine speeds to steal
    identities, resources, and advantage. The rising volume and virulence of these
    attacks have the potential to degrade our economic capacity and threaten basic
    services that underpin our modern way of life. This discussion paper explores
    the idea of a healthy, resilient - and fundamentally more secure - cyber ecosystem
    of the future, in which cyber participants, including cyber devices, are able
    to work together in near-real time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit
    the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences
    of attacks, and recover to a trusted state. In this future cyber ecosystem, security
    capabilities are built into cyber devices in a way that allows preventive and
    defensive courses of action to be coordinated within and among communities of
    devices. Power is distributed among participants, and near-real time coordination
    is enabled by combining the innate and interoperable capabilities of individual
    devices with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies.
    To illuminate such a cyber ecosystem in action, one might look at today''s practice
    known as “continuous monitoring,” in which system managers use a variety of software
    products to automatically detect and report known security vulnerabilities in
    network nodes. In some cases, system managers further configure their systems
    to automatically remediate detected security deficiencies. To offer an analogy,
    continuous monitoring is to a healthy cyber ecosystem as smoke detectors and sprinkler
    systems are to a “smart” building. At the other end of sophistication in the orderly
    management of a complex system, we draw inspiration from the human body''s immune
    system. To paint a picture that mirrors the body''s ability to defend itself is
    complex. It might include layered defenses and countermeasures that work in tandem;
    specialized roles; powerful methods for rapidly identifying attackers; surge capabilities;
    and the ability to learn and rapidly adapt. A companion analogy may be made to
    the public health system and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    Here, cyber equivalent functions might include threat and incident watch, data
    dissemination, threat analysis, intervention recommendations, and coordination
    of preventive actions. Automation is one of three interdependent building blocks
    of a healthy cyber ecosystem, along with interoperability and authentication.
    Automation can increase speed of action, optimize decision making, and ease adoption
    of new security solutions. A healthy cyber ecosystem might employ an automation
    strategy of fixed, local defenses supported by mobile and global defenses at multiple
    levels. Such a strategy could enable the cyber ecosystem to sustain itself and
    supported missions while fighting through attacks. Further, it could enable the
    ecosystem to continuously strengthen itself against the cyber equivalent of autoimmune
    disorders. Interoperability can broaden and strengthen collaboration, create new
    intelligence, hasten and spread learning, and improve situational awareness. This
    paper posits three types of interoperability - semantic (i.e., shared lexicon
    based on common understanding), technical, and policy - as fundamental to integrating
    disparate cyber participants into a comprehensive cyber defense system. It examines
    how the cybersecurity community has achieved some early successes by explicitly
    separating the management of security information from the management of security
    functions in an approach called security content automation. Such successes include:
    developing naming conventions and shared lists and catalogs of the fundamental
    elements that we identify here as the ecosystem; creating and using machine readable
    languages and formats for expressing security policies or encoding security transactions;
    and developing and using knowledge repositories for best practices, benchmarks,
    profiles, standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules and principles,
    among others. The paper also looks at some challenges associated with expanding
    this approach to ensure a widely distributed, automated, collective defense. Authentication
    can improve trust in ways that enhance privacy and decision making. It is integral
    to many capabilities beyond cyber defense, and the paper looks to the emerging
    National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), detailed below,
    to build a shared foundation. The paper calls for identification and authentication
    technologies that deliver across five operational objectives: security, affordability,
    ease of use and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Additionally,
    the paper calls for consumer guides that rate technologies across all five objectives
    and assist system developers and owners in making phased improvements and selections.
    For automated cyber defense, it calls for strong standards-based device authentication,
    including for software, handheld devices, and small, often wireless, devices composing
    massively scalable grids. The paper also draws on current research on network-enabled
    enterprises that is recasting traditional notions of command and control in the
    direction of focus and convergence. Focus provides the context and defines the
    purposes of an endeavor, but is agnostic regarding who might be in charge or particular
    lines of authority. Convergence refers to the goal-seeking process that guides
    actions and effects, but recognizes that control works in an unconventional manner
    in highly distributed systems. The paper presents a five-level maturity model
    for ecosystem focus and convergence that is associated with increasing agility
    and provides an approach for defining how to achieve and employ these various
    levels. Ecosystem maturity is further explored through a discussion of healthy
    attributes-eight for the ecosystem and eighteen for participants and exchanges.
    The paper concludes with a brief discussion of incentives and recommendations
    for the way ahead. It posits that the slow adoption of available best practices
    and technologies in the face of increasing cyber attacks indicates an imbalance
    of incentives and proposes that better and more widely disseminated aggregated
    and anonymized information about the frequency and actual harm of cyber attacks
    is needed. Despite the many open questions remaining, the field is ripe for planning
    and action.'

  description: Burkina Faso ranges amongst the fastest growing countries in the world
    with an annual population growth rate of more than three percent. This trend has
    consequences for food security since agricultural productivity is still on a comparatively
    low level in Burkina Faso. In order to compensate for the low productivity, the
    agricultural areas are expanding quickly. The mapping and monitoring of this expansion
    is difficult, even on the basis of remote sensing imagery, since the extensive
    farming practices and frequent cloud coverage in the area make the delineation
    of cultivated land from other land cover and land use types a challenging task.
    However, as the rapidly increasing population could have considerable effects
    on the natural resources and on the regional development of the country, methods
    for improved mapping of LULCC (land use and land cover change) are needed. For
    this study, we applied the newly developed ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal
    Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) framework to generate high temporal (8-day)
    and high spatial (30 m) resolution NDVI time series for all of Burkina Faso for
    the years 2001, 2007, and 2014. For this purpose, more than 500 Landsat scenes
    and 3000 MODIS scenes were processed with this automated framework. The generated
    ESTARFM NDVI time series enabled extraction of per-pixel phenological features
    that all together served as input for the delineation of agricultural areas via
    random forest classification at 30 m spatial resolution for entire Burkina Faso
    and the three years. For training and validation, a randomly sampled reference
    dataset was generated from Google Earth images and based on expert knowledge.
    The overall accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) indicate the
    well-functioning of the applied methodology. The results show an expansion of
    agricultural area of 91% between 2001 and 2014 to a total of 116,900 km2. While
    rainfed agricultural areas account for the major part of this trend, irrigated
    areas and plantations also increased considerably, primarily promoted by specific
    development projects. This expansion goes in line with the rapid population growth
    in most provinces of Burkina Faso where land was still available for an expansion
    of agricultural area. The analysis of agricultural encroachment into protected
    areas and their surroundings highlights the increased human pressure on these
    areas and the challenges of environmental protection for the future.

    (30 m) resolution NDVI time series for Burkina Faso, spanning three years (2001,

    of agricultural regions using random forest classification at a spatial resolution
    of 30 meters. Key findings include:


    1. A remarkable rise in agricultural area, from 61,100 km² in 2001 to 116,900
    km² in 2014

    2. A surge in plantation area of nearly 180% between 2001 and 2014

    3. A rapid increase in irrigated area, particularly around water reservoirs and
    major rivers

    4. A marked expansion of agricultural activity into previously uncultivated regions


    An important implication of the study is that this agricultural expansion and
    the accompanying population growth are putting pressure on protected areas and
    may undermine their effectiveness.'

    considerable changes. Since the year 2000, the population grew by about 56% from
    11.6 million to 18.1 million people in 2015 [1]. Burkina Faso still ranks among
    the least developed countries in the world (Human Development Index, HDR = 0.402,
    rank 183 of 188 countries, [2]), even though the gross domestic product (GDP)
    exhibited a sustained growth during recent years with a plus of 6.7% in 2013 [3,4].
    Since the economy is relatively undiversified and relies heavily on rainfed agricultural
    production, the country is highly vulnerable to climatic and economic shocks such
    as droughts, international market price fluctuations or political instability
    [4,5]. Thus, poverty, especially in rural areas, still prevails, and with a rapidly
    growing population also the number of undernourished people increased in recent
    years [4]. Despite the fact that the country is said to have a high agricultural
    potential [6,7] and more than 90% of the country’s labor force is working in the
    agricultural sector, the crop productivity per hectare did not rise considerably
    during the last 50 years [1]. Thus in order to improve the situation in Burkina
    Faso, amongst others agricultural systems food security must be further developed.
    Agriculture in Burkina Faso is characterized by small-scale rainfed subsistence
    farming with average farm sizes of less than 5 ha [8]. The lack of own capital
    and access to credits results in extensive farming as characterized by a low level
    of agricultural inputs, mechanization, fertilizer application, as well as irrigation
    [4,5]. With a rapidly increasing population and little improvement in agricultural
    productivity, farmers compensate by expanding cultivated area. As a consequence,
    it is estimated that the country will reach its limits of arable land by the year
    2030 [5]. Furthermore, this expansion also threatens natural resources, and the
    pressure on the last remnants of natural vegetation is increasing [9]. In order
    to capture the whole anthropogenic need of space for agricultural production,
    (rainfed) agricultural area is defined here as farmed land with partial tree cover
    (<10%, potentially fruit trees) including the prevailing crop-fallow rotation
    system of annual crops and intensive pasture, i.e., shrub-free, partially fenced
    areas frequently used for grazing. Even though accurate spatial documentation
    of the past and current extent of agricultural areas is essential information
    for decision makers, such information is currently missing. For Burkina Faso,
    statistical data on cropped area exist which are derived from household surveys
    conducted by the National Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Fishery Resources
    but these are of varying quality and only available at province level [10]. Agricultural
    extent can be deduced from global land cover maps such as the 500 m MODIS (Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) product MCD12Q1 [11], the 300 m ESA CCI
    (European Space Agency, Climate Change Initiative) land cover product [12] or
    the Chinese 30 m products FROM-GLC (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring
    of Global Land Cover) and GLOBELAND30 [13,14]. However, the usability of this
    data is often limited for detailed regional scale applications due to low spatial
    resolution, missing thematic complexity, temporal availability or regional accuracy
    [15,16,17]. Regionally optimized land cover information for West Africa based
    on moderate resolution (250 m) remote sensing data [15] give a good overview of
    the distribution of agriculture in Burkina Faso. Nonetheless, they face difficulties
    in the discrimination of small-scale agriculture from natural vegetation classes
    and are so far not available for recent years. Lambert et al. [18] derived croplands
    from 100 m PROBA-V data for the Sudanian and Sahelian region of West Africa for
    the year 2014. This interesting approach however is also struggling with some
    spatial resolution based errors in heterogeneous areas. Furthermore, high to medium
    resolution (5–30 m) remote sensing based land cover maps exist which are regionally
    optimized but they only cover small parts of the country [9,19,20,21]. In general,
    remote sensing is a highly suitable tool for large scale and cost efficient mapping
    of agricultural area. However, remote sensing based monitoring of the spatio-temporal
    development of agriculture in Burkina Faso and Africa in general is a challenging
    task. The above described small-scale extensive farming systems require high temporal
    and spatial resolution data for an accurate delineation. Landsat data may have
    a sufficient spatial resolution (30 m) to capture single fields but due to frequent
    cloud cover [22] and limited data availability for West Africa during the past
    decades (Landsat-5 and Landsat-7), gap-free coverage of the country is mainly
    limited to the dry season when the agricultural area is difficult to delineate
    from other natural land cover types. Because of its high temporal resolution and
    its globally uniform acquisition scheme, the MODIS sensors deliver data more continuously
    but the spatial resolution of 250 m or less is not satisfactory to delimit small-scale
    agricultural areas [23]. Thus, in this study, a data fusion approach was chosen
    to combine the strengths of the two sensor systems (MODIS and Landsat) and to
    generate a high temporal (8-day) and high spatial (30 m) resolution time series
    for a better delineation of agricultural area in Burkina Faso. For this purpose,
    the ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model)
    framework for large- and cloud-prone area processing was employed [24,25]. The
    goals of this study are to derive high spatial (30 m) resolution information of
    agricultural area for entire Burkina Faso for the years 2001, 2007, and 2014.
    Based on these maps, the spatio-temporal development of the major food-producing
    land use types (rainfed agricultural area, irrigated agricultural area and plantations)
    is identified. Furthermore, the connection between agricultural expansion and
    population growth and the regional differences within Burkina Faso are outlined.
    Finally, the influence of agricultural expansion on natural reserves with different
    protection status is examined with a buffer analysis for selected protected areas
    and their surroundings. 2. Study Area Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in
    the center of West Africa with a size of approx. 274,000 km² (Figure 1). The climate
    is characterized by a North-South moisture gradient and mainly influenced by the
    interaction between the West African Monsoon bringing rainfalls from the Southwest
    during the rainy season and the Harmattan blowing hot winds from the North during
    the dry season. The annual rainfall ranges from less than 300 mm in the North
    to more than 1100 mm in the South with distinct rainy and dry seasons. The rainy
    season occurs between May and October for four to five months with shorter duration
    in the North [26,27]. The mean monthly temperatures range between 23 °C and 34
    °C in the North and 25–31 °C in the South [28]. Figure 1. Study area of Burkina
    Faso showing the position of the used Landsat and MODIS tiles. The northern part
    of Burkina Faso is located in the Sahel zone or Sahelian Acacia Savanna. The natural
    vegetation of this area predominantly consists of wooded grassland and deciduous
    shrubland with a sparse tree layer [29]. The southern part of the country is located
    in the West Sudanian savanna; its natural vegetation is characterized by a more
    dense deciduous shrubland and woodland and is known for its high agricultural
    potential [7,30,31]. The major staple crops in Burkina Faso are maize, millet
    and sorghum while cotton is the most important agricultural export commodity [1,4].
    Some irrigated areas of minor extent can be found mainly in the direct vicinity
    of dammed lakes. In the southwest of Burkina Faso, especially around the city
    of Banfora, plantations of fruit trees such as mango and citrus fruits as well
    as nut trees (e.g., cashew and shea nuts) are located [32,33]. In recent years,
    these plantation products experienced a considerable rise in production and export
    value (compare Section 4.1.1) [34]. The overall number of inhabitants in Burkina
    Faso has increased significantly during recent years, from about 12 million in
    2001 to more than 17 million people in 2014 [1]. The rural population, which predominantly
    works in the agricultural sector, is concentrated in the central provinces around
    the capital of Ouagadougou (Figure 2). Since 2001, the rural population increased
    in most parts of the country, even in the remote, northern provinces bordering
    the Sahara [35]. Figure 2. Development of rural population density in the provinces
    of Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014 [35]. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Landsat
    Data and Preprocessing A total number of 504 surface reflectance scenes from Landsat
    sensors 5, 7, and 8 were obtained for a total of 17 tiles (Figure 1) from the
    USGS Landsat Archive [36]. The data covers the periods December 2000–January 2002
    (Landsat-7), December 2006–October 2007 (Landsat-5) and December 2013–January
    2015 (Landsat-8). For the year 2007, no Landsat-5 data were available after October
    and generally no images were available in 2007 for the two southwestern tiles
    (path/row: 193/52, 192/52). The surface reflectance datasets are atmospherically
    corrected with the L8SR algorithm [37] and include cloud and cloud shadow masks
    derived with the CFmask algorithm [37,38]. These masks were applied to the red
    and near infrared (NIR) bands of the scenes and from these, the NDVI was calculated.
    3.2. MODIS Data and Preprocessing Daily 500 m MODIS nadir bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance datasets (MCD43A4, Col. 6) were
    obtained for the tiles h17v07, h17v08, and h18v07 (Figure 1), and for the same
    periods as the Landsat data. MCD43A4 is a 16-day rolling composite product with
    the center date of this period associated to the daily dataset [39]. On the basis
    of the data in this compositing period, the best possible BRDF is derived for
    the correction of the reflectances [24,39]. From the red and NIR bands of the
    MODIS datasets, daily NDVI was calculated and further processed with the software
    TIMESAT [40]. First, outliers that deviate more than 0.2 times from the standard
    deviation in a moving window (width = 104 days) were removed from the time series
    [40]. For the interpolation of the resulting gaps and in order to reduce residual
    noise, the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter [41] implemented in TIMESAT was then
    applied to the time series. For this purpose, a filter window size of 30 days
    and an adaptation strength of 2 were selected. The values of the filter as well
    as the factor of 0.2 for outlier removal were determined based on a visual analysis
    of their effects in the TIMESAT graphical user interface [40]. Detailed information
    on the time series filtering can be found in [40]. After filtering, the MODIS
    datasets were reprojected to UTM zone 30°N, automatically co-registered and resampled
    to Landsat 30 m spatial resolution with nearest neighbor method (Figure 3). Figure

    of maps of agricultural area for entire Burkina Faso. 3.3. Reference Data Collection
    In order to generate an accurate remote sensing based land cover and land use
    (LULC) classification a high quality reference database for training and validation
    of the classifier is required. However, such a database is not readily available
    for entire Burkina Faso. From several field trips within the scope of the WASCAL
    (West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use) [42]
    project during recent years, a range of LULC ground sampling points are available.
    Nonetheless, these do not cover the whole country and are not available for all
    focus years. However, the field data and the gathered field trip knowledge were
    used for the interpretation of very high resolution (VHR) imagery as provided
    by Google Earth. In this way, a comprehensive reference dataset for training and
    validation was generated. Such an approach was conducted previously by various
    authors for large-scale remote sensing based studies [15,43,44]. Samples were
    selected for eight general thematic LULC classes with a focus on agriculture.
    These classes were defined based on existing regional LULC descriptions [45] and
    expert knowledge of the region (Table 1). A Simple Random Sampling set [46,47]
    of 700 locations was generated in order to ensure an unbiased distribution of
    reference points across the study area. As suggested by Congalton and Green [47],
    at least 100 samples were collected for phenologically heterogeneous classes (e.g.,
    rainfed agricultural area) and a minimum of 50 samples were assembled for temporally
    stable classes (e.g., water). In Google Earth, the closest spatially homogeneous
    area (of at least nine Landsat pixels) to the respective random point was delineated
    by a polygon and the class was identified for each of the three focus years (2001,
    2007, 2014) with available Google Earth data for interpretation. Even though an
    unbiased distribution of ground truth data is important for an accurate classification,
    the Simple Random Sampling results in a low number of samples for less frequent
    LULC classes. Thus, additional reference data was collected for these classes
    to fulfill the above-mentioned minimum number of samples by directly targeting
    known areas of the respective class. The final reference dataset for training
    and validation contained 771, 836, and 1147 polygons for the years 2001, 2007,
    and 2014, respectively. Table 1. Classification scheme. 3.4. Generation of High
    Spatial and Temporal Resolution Time Series and Classification Features The ESTARFM
    framework was designed by Knauer et al. [24] as a further development to ESTARFM
    [25] in order to generate high temporal and spatial resolution time series in
    an automated and time-efficient way for large-scale, cloud-prone and heterogeneous
    areas. For this purpose, a filling of cloud-gaps prior to the time series generation
    was included to make best use of partly cloud-covered Landsat input images. Further
    enhancements of the original ESTARFM method focus on the user-friendly, consistent,
    and accurate application of the algorithm for large areas. In this study, the
    ESTARFM framework was applied to generate 30 m, 8-day NDVI time series from the
    MODIS and Landsat input data for the years 2001, 2007, and 2014 for entire Burkina
    Faso based on the procedure generally described in Knauer et al. [24]. On the
    basis of these time series, a number of temporal features such as land surface
    phenology (LSP) metrics of the different LULC types of Burkina Faso can be delineated
    (compare Figure 3). This is valuable information for the discrimination of classes
    which are spectrally similar but show a different phenological development, e.g.,
    agricultural area, grassland, and savanna. As previous studies in the same latitudes
    of West Africa have shown, the differentiation of such classes is highly challenging
    when using only mono-temporal remote sensing data [18,19,48]. In total, 57 features
    were generated for the classification of 2001 and 2014 (Table 2). For the classification
    of the year 2007, only 41 features were used since not the whole annual time series
    could be generated due to a lack of Landsat input data towards the end of the
    year. The NDVI of all available 8-day time steps was used as classification features
    (45 layers for 2001 and 2014 and 33 layers for 2007). In addition, eight phenological
    metrics for 2001 and 2014 (four for the year 2007) were derived with the TIMESAT
    software [40]. Furthermore, the mean NDVI, the maximum NDVI as well as a seasonal
    sum of NDVI (DOY 119-263) were calculated for each of the three annual time series.
    An additional 1 km WorldClim precipitation dataset [28] of annual long-term average
    rainfalls (1960–1990) was resampled to 30 m and included as input for the classification.
    The precipitation dataset represents the North-South moisture gradient of Burkina
    Faso and the changing phenology of different LULC types along this gradient which
    has been demonstrated in previous studies [23,48,49,50]. Table 2. Features used
    for the classification. The top eight features were generated with TIMESAT [40].
    Features marked with an * could not be generated from the Landsat data available
    for 2007. 3.5. Classification Approach and Accuracy Assessment In this study,
    the random forest classification approach (RF) was applied for the delineation
    of LULC classes from the fused earth observation time series [51]. The classifier
    has been frequently used during the recent decade due to its strong and quick
    performance, its robustness to noise and overfitting, as well as its user-friendliness,
    since it does not require extensive tuning of its parameters [15,43,51]. The RF
    classifications in this study were conducted using the randomForest package implemented
    in the programming language R [52] and based on Breiman’s random forest algorithm
    [51]. The final RF models, which were built independently for the three years,
    were based on a sufficiently high number of 500 decision trees and a default mtry
    value of 12, which is the number of randomly sampled variables at each split of
    a decision tree. The reference database was split randomly into sets of 70% and
    30% of the sample polygons as commonly recommended [43,53]. The 70% reference
    set was used for the training of the classifier and the 30% reference set was
    applied for the validation of its performance. The accuracy of the classifications
    was analyzed on the basis of confusion matrices, which highlight the separate
    user’s and producer’s accuracies for each class as well as the overall accuracy
    and indicate which classes are over- or underrepresented in the result [47]. In
    order to increase the accuracy of the classification as well as to sharpen the
    focus on agricultural areas several post-classification rules were applied. First,
    the classes Woody Vegetation, Grassland, Temporarily Flooded, and Forest were
    merged into one Savanna class, since they are not in the focus of this study but
    were classified separately due to their different spectral characteristics. Furthermore,
    areas with an annual mean NDVI of less than 0.2 were excluded from the Irrigated
    Agricultural Area class. The extent of lentic waterbodies varies significantly
    with the seasons in Burkina Faso. Since some of these temporarily flooded shore
    areas were misclassified as Irrigated Agricultural Area, but are clearly not cultivated
    (due to low NDVI and confirmed by visual inspection), they were reclassified as
    Temporarily Flooded. In addition, Rainfed Agricultural Area was overestimated
    in protected areas where frequent fires during the dry season seriously influence
    the phenology of vegetation and lead to misclassifications. In order to overcome
    this, the MODIS burned area product MCD45A1 [54] was applied for such regions
    to identify affected areas and reclassify them as Woody Vegetation. 3.6. Analyzing
    Connections to Population and Natural Reserves The relationship between agricultural
    expansion and rural population growth was investigated by highlighting the changes
    of the two variables on a provincial level. Furthermore, per province agricultural
    area and rural population were correlated for the years 2001, 2014 and the respective
    change between those years and the dependency was assessed with the Pearson product-moment
    correlation coefficient [55]. In addition, the change in agricultural area per
    rural person between 2001 and 2014 was determined to examine the development of
    available farmland for self-subsistence. In order to analyze the influence of
    agricultural expansion on natural reserves, two focus areas were selected and
    the development of agricultural area in their vicinity was monitored over the
    three years. This was done by a buffer analysis measuring the density of agriculture
    in the reserve itself and in five 2 km distance zones (0–2 km, 2–4 km, 4–6 km,
    6–8 km, 8–10 km) surrounding the reserve. 3.7. Ancillary Data Several supplementary
    datasets were used for the analyses in this study. The shapefile of protected
    areas (Figure 1) was acquired from the Institut Géographique du Burkina Faso (IGB)
    [56]. It contains natural reserves of different protection categories and represents
    the status of the year 2005. Furthermore, the rural population numbers of the
    provinces (Figure 2) were derived from census data obtained from the Institut
    National de la Statistique et de la Démographie (INSD) [35]. In addition, information
    about national harvested area of primary crops and estimations of agricultural
    area for the years 2001 and 2013 were downloaded from FAOSTAT [1]. For the direct
    comparison with the classification results of 2014, agricultural statistics are
    so far unavailable in the FAO database. 4. Results The results are presented in
    three major sections: first, the novel Burkina Faso wide high resolution agricultural
    classifications are shown and regional differences and developments of agricultural
    patterns are highlighted giving examples of plantations, as well as rainfed and
    irrigated agricultural area. Then, the implications of agricultural expansion
    for protected areas are exemplarily analyzed and outlined based on two focus regions.
    Lastly, the link between agricultural area expansion and rural population increase
    is highlighted. In the following sections, the agricultural classification of
    2007 is only used and presented for focus regions since it does not cover the
    whole country due to a lack of Landsat input data as described in Section 3.1.
    4.1. Agricultural Area in Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014 The extent of agricultural
    area at a 30 m spatial resolution for the years 2001 and 2014 can be seen in Figure
    4. In 2001, rainfed agricultural area covers about 60,441 km² which corresponds
    to 22% of Burkina Faso’s land surface (Table 3). It is mainly accumulated in the
    central area around the capital Ouagadougou and in the regions southeast of it.
    The more remote areas such as the northern Sahel region, the East bordering Nigeria
    and Niger as well as the moist southwestern regions were for the major part not
    cultivated in 2001. With an approximate extent of 561 km² in 2001, almost all
    of the plantations are established in these southwestern regions where the climate
    is more humid and the rainfalls are highest. In terms of size, the irrigated areas
    only play a minor role (about 78 km²) and are mainly located around the water
    reservoirs in the same regions as the rainfed agricultural areas. Figure 4. Extent
    of agricultural area of Burkina Faso for the years 2001 (top) and 2014 (bottom).
    Framed areas mark the locations of the focus sites of Section 4.4, the Tiogo classified
    forest (A) and the Kaboré Tambi National Park (B). Table 3. Agricultural area
    in km² and percentage change for the years 2001 and 2014. Between 2001 and 2014,
    the rainfed agricultural area increased by about 90% to 114,994 km² and now covers
    about 42% of the country area. While the already densely cultivated central region
    of Burkina Faso only marginally expanded its rainfed agricultural area, it spread
    into all parts of the country, also into the above mentioned remote areas. The
    plantation area in 2014 almost tripled to 1568 km² and two main regions are clearly
    visible: one is located in the northwest of the city of Banfora, mostly in the
    provinces Kénédougou and Léraba, and one is situated in the southeast of Banfora,
    in the provinces Comoé and Poni. With an increasing number of water reservoirs,
    also the irrigated area expanded significantly by about 340% although the total
    number of 345 km² is still low in comparison to the other forms of agriculture.
    The overall accuracies for the three classified years are 92% for 2001, 91% for
    2007, and 91% for 2014, and can be investigated in Table 4 including class-specific
    user’s and producer’s accuracies. While rainfed agricultural area displays user’s
    and producer’s accuracies of more than 80% for all three years, irrigated agriculture
    shows some underestimation and thus lower producer’s accuracies for the years
    2007 and 2014 due to some confusion with temporarily flooded vegetation. For plantation
    areas, the user’s and producer’s accuracies range between 77% and 97%. Some overestimations
    occur along rivers confusing plantation with gallery forests. Table 4. Confusion
    matrices indicating overall accuracies as well as user’s (UA) and producer’s accuracies
    (PA) for each agricultural class in percent for the years 2001 (top), 2007 (middle),
    and 2014 (bottom). 4.1.1. Development of Plantation Area Between 2001 and 2014,
    a significant increase in plantation area of 179% from approximately 56,000 ha
    to 157,000 ha can be observed (compare Table 3). The six southwestern provinces
    of Comoé, Kénédougou, Léraba, Poni, Houet, and Noumbiel (Figure 5 left) make up
    99% of Burkina Faso’s plantation area. The Comoé province alone contains about
    71,000 ha of plantation in 2014, which corresponds to 46% of the total plantation
    area of Burkina Faso. Figure 5 right reflects this development in detail, exemplarily
    for a focus site in the Kénédougou province, one of the major plantation regions
    of Burkina Faso. While the plantations in 2001 (light green) are rather small,
    scattered, and have undefined outlines, they increased considerably in size and
    numbers towards 2014 (dark green). Also the shapes of the plantations are much
    more distinct in 2014. Figure 5. Major plantation provinces and their plantation
    coverage for 2001 and 2014 (left) and development of a plantation area in the
    province of Kénédougou between 2001 and 2014 (right); position marked by red rectangle
    in the left figure. 4.1.2. Development of Irrigation Area Efficient irrigated
    agriculture could be a key to improving food security in Burkina Faso and mitigating
    the negative effects of the varying timing and length of the rainy season for
    cultivation [57]. The country has an estimated potential of about 233,500 ha irrigable
    land but as highlighted above only a small fraction of this area is currently
    under irrigation (34,500 ha in 2014) [57,58,59]. The main areas of irrigation
    lie in the central, northern, and westernmost provinces of Burkina Faso (Figure
    6). Especially in the central and northern regions of Burkina Faso, the irrigation
    areas are mainly located around natural lakes or small water reservoirs established
    through the damming of rivers. Although, the smaller reservoirs are often used
    for household water supply and livestock than for irrigation, the distribution
    of reservoirs derived from the classification results partially reflects the provinces
    with higher irrigation area. Figure 6. Irrigated area per province for the year
    2014 and locations of artificial water reservoirs for the years 2001 and 2014
    derived by digitization from the classification results; the white rectangle marks
    the location of Figure 7. Figure 7. Development of an irrigation area at the Bagré
    dam in southern Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014; Location of focus area within
    Burkina Faso is marked in Figure 6. However, the highest values of irrigation
    area per province can be attributed to respective single major irrigation systems
    (confirmed by visual inspection). These areas receive their water supply directly
    from the major rivers of Burkina Faso and their tributary streams and not from
    reservoirs. One exception is the irrigation area at the Lake Bagré (Figure 7 and
    white rectangle in Figure 6), which developed with the construction of a hydropower
    dam retaining the water of the White Volta river in 1994. In 2001, the area under
    irrigation at the Lake Bagré covered approximately 9.26 km². In 2007 and 2014,
    it increased to 21.67 km² and to 37.28 km² respectively which equals an expansion
    of about 300% over the 14 years. Today, Lake Bagré is one of the biggest connected
    irrigation systems in Burkina Faso. 4.2. Feature Importance The respective importance
    of input features for the discrimination of different classes in the study area
    is shown in Figure 8. Precipitation is the most important feature representing
    the North-South moisture gradient of Burkina Faso and the general occurrence of
    classes along this gradient. In general, wetlands and forests are more frequent
    in Burkina Faso’s southern regions. The Start of Season (SOS) shows early dates
    for the irrigated agricultural areas which are more independent of the onset of
    rainfalls, while rainfed agricultural areas generally show later SOS than the
    natural vegetation classes. This can be explained by the reaction of natural vegetation
    to the first rainfalls while rainfed agricultural areas are commonly sown later.
    The NDVI of DOY 271 (end of September) represents the peak of rainy season, similar
    to the Middle of Season (MOS) feature. For dense vegetation classes such as forests
    and plantation, the NDVI of DOY 271 is generally higher and the MOS tends to be
    later. Figure 8. Mean feature importance of the 20 most important features for
    the years 2001–2014 scaled between 0 and 100. 4.3. Relationship between Agricultural
    Expansion and Population Growth The total population of Burkina Faso grew rapidly
    during the period of investigation from approx. 12 million in 2001 to more than
    17 million people in 2014 [1]. As outlined in Section 2, also the rural population
    increased in almost all provinces during that time. Especially the more remote
    provinces like Tapoa (TAP), Comoé (COM) or Houet (HOU) increased in rural population
    by up to 244,000 people (Figure 9 left) [35]. The central provinces with an already
    high population density in 2001 as well as the central southern provinces only
    increased moderately in population numbers. The only province with a negative
    rural population development is the province of Zondoma (ZON) decreasing by about
    58,000 rural inhabitants. Figure 9. Change of rural population in the provinces
    of Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014 (left) [35] and expansion of agricultural
    area in the provinces derived from the classification results (right); the province
    names are abbreviated by three letters. Similar patterns as for the rural population
    growth can be observed for the expansion of agricultural area in the provinces
    between 2001 and 2014 (Figure 9 right). Agriculture spread into all remote and
    so far rather uncultivated regions of Burkina Faso. The above mentioned provinces
    Tapoa (TAP) and Comoé (COM) are among the provinces with the biggest agricultural
    expansion with an increase of about 323,000 ha and 315,000 ha, respectively. However,
    the highest numbers of expansion are observed for the two Northern provinces Kossi
    (KOS) with a plus of 392,000 ha and Soum (SOM) with an increase of 386,000 ha
    between 2001 and 2014. Similar to the changes in population growth, the central
    provinces show only moderate levels of agricultural expansion between 600 ha for
    the Koulpélogo province (KOP) and 60,000 ha for the Bazèga province (BAZ). In
    a quantitative comparison of agricultural area and rural population in the provinces,
    a direct relationship becomes evident. For 2001, the numbers of rural inhabitants
    correlate with the extent of agricultural areas (r = 0.84) with highest numbers
    primarily for the larger central provinces like Sanmatenga (SMT), Boulgou (BLG),
    and Yatenga (YAT) (Figure 10a). For 2014, the numbers for the two variables generally
    increase in the provinces but the relationship between them stays the same (r
    = 0.84) (Figure 10b). While the leading provinces of 2001 are still among the
    highest in 2014, the above mentioned remote provinces of Comoé (COM), Soum (SOM),
    and especially a group of provinces from the region Est, Tapoa (TAP), Gourma (GOU),
    and Gnagna (GNA), joined the provinces with highest population numbers and biggest
    agricultural area. Though there are various reasons and pathways for different
    developments of the two variables, it is obvious that agricultural expansion and
    rural population growth go in line for multiple provinces (Figure 10c). Besides
    some single provinces, the more remote regions of Est, Sahel and Boucle de Mouhoun
    exhibit the highest changes in both variables. The central and generally smaller
    provinces of the regions Centre-Est, Centre-Sud, and Plateau Central only increased
    in rural population numbers without considerable agricultural expansion. Figure
    10. Scatterplots of agricultural area versus rural population in the provinces
    for the years 2001 (a) and 2014 (b) and the changes between the two years (c);
    the coloring of the points refers to the regions of Burkina Faso (d). The average
    agricultural area per rural inhabitant rose from 0.63 ha to 0.88 ha (Figure 11).
    Especially in the more remote provinces like Oudalan (OUD), Soum (SOM) or Kossi
    (KOS) the agricultural area grew considerably while there was only a moderate
    population growth resulting in increases of up to 1.24 ha/person. While most provinces
    registered a plus in agricultural area per person, some provinces in the central
    and southwest of Burkina Faso almost did not change or decreased. Especially the
    provinces Zoundwéogo (ZOU), Kouritenga (KOT), and Koulpélogo (KOP) lost up to
    0.66 ha per person. These are also the provinces with the smallest agricultural
    expansion while still increasing their rural population numbers by up to 240,000
    people (ZOU) over the considered 14 years. Figure 11. Change of agricultural area
    (in ha) per person (rural) in the provinces of Burkina Faso between 2001 and 2014;
    the province names are abbreviated by three letters. 4.4. Implications for Natural
    Reserves In this section, an in-depth study of two protected areas (compare Figure
    4) was conducted showing the development of agricultural area in their vicinity.
    The first one is the Kaboré Tambi National Park, which was founded in 1976 and
    directly adjacent in the Northwest, the classified forest Nazinon which lie about
    60 km south of Ouagadougou (Figure 1 and Figure 12). In 2001, the agricultural
    area inside the boundaries of the two protected areas was very low (3%) and was
    almost exclusively found in the Nazinon forest. Also the direct surroundings of
    the Kaboré Tambi are only marginally cultivated because of an apparent buffer
    zone around parts of the park borders. Figure 12. Maps of agricultural area in
    the Kaboré Tambi National Park and its surroundings for 2001, 2007, and 2014 (top)
    and plot of the development of agricultural area in the protected area and in
    2 km distance zones around it between 2001 and 2014 (bottom); Location of focus
    area within Burkina Faso is marked in Figure 4. Between 2001 and 2007, the agriculture
    in these protected areas did not change but it increased in all distance zones
    with a maximum of 43% within the 8–10 km zone. In 2014, the cultivated area in
    this zone increased by another 8% and values of dense agriculture are drawing
    closer to the park, but the protected area remains unaffected. This indicates
    a functioning protection of the park despite the concentration of agricultural
    area in its vicinity. However, this concentration also increases the isolation
    of the park and hinders animal movement to other habitat areas with a decreasing
    number of natural patches (stepstones) in between. The second example, the classified
    forest of Tiogo is located about 130 km west of Ouagadougou and is a formally
    protected area adjacent to other areas with the same status (Figure 1 and Figure
    13). However, Tiogo does not underlie an exclusive park management as the Kaboré
    Tambi National Park [60]. Figure 13. Maps of agricultural area in the classified
    forest Tiogo and its surroundings for 2001, 2007, and 2014 (top) and plot of the
    development of agricultural area in the protected area and in 2 km distance zones
    around it between 2001 and 2014 (bottom); Location of focus area within Burkina
    Faso is marked in Figure 4. In 2001, some croplands were detected in the northeastern
    part of Tiogo but so far they only cover 3% of the total area. The agricultural
    area in the surroundings of the park is moderately dense and reaches up to 36%
    in the 4–6 km distance zone. In 2007, the fields in the Northeast of Tiogo advance
    towards the center of the protected area and increased significantly to 13% of
    the total forest area. Also the surrounding agriculture increases in all distance
    zones with a maximum of 51% in the 8–10 km zone. Finally in 2014, the agriculture
    in the northeastern part of Tiogo intensifies (18% of total area) and dense agricultural
    area covering more than 50% starts right at the border of the Tiogo classified
    forest increasing the pressure on the remaining protected area. 5. Discussion
    5.1. Classification of Agricultural Area Based on Dense Time Series In this study,
    a novel approach was applied for the derivation of countrywide agricultural classifications
    with a high spatial resolution (30 m) for entire Burkina Faso and three years.
    On the basis of the ESTARFM framework, an 8-day time series was generated and
    in combination with subsequently derived phenological metrics it was used to delineate
    different agricultural use types from savanna vegetation in Burkina Faso. The
    overall classification accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) show
    the suitability of this approach. The possibility to use a dense time series instead
    of single scenes with at the same time high spatial resolution is an important
    feature of this method. The frequent cloud coverage in West Africa decreases the
    data availability of common satellite sensors significantly [22] and often limits
    gap-free coverage of the country to the dry season when agricultural area is difficult
    to delineate. Furthermore, the small-scale extensive farming systems in Burkina
    Faso require a sufficiently high spatial resolution for the delineation of single
    fields. Thus, the sole use of high temporal (≤8 days) but lower spatial resolution
    time series (≥250 m, e.g., of MODIS or the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer,
    AVHRR) leads to high amounts of mixed pixels. To deal with this issue, alternative
    approaches such as fractional cover of agricultural area would have to be applied
    [19]. To our knowledge, there are so far no other products in this high spatial
    resolution and thematic complexity focusing on the accurate delineation of agricultural
    area in entire Burkina Faso for several years. For 2014, Lambert et al. [18] derived
    croplands from 100 m PROBA-V data for the Sudanian and Sahelian region of West
    Africa. The use of time series contributed to a suitable classification result
    but spatial resolution based errors still occurred in heterogeneous areas. Different
    global land cover maps like the MODIS MCD12Q1 [11] or GLOBELAND30 [13] also include
    agricultural area, but their usability for detailed regional scale applications
    is often limited due to spatial or temporal resolution as well as thematic complexity
    [15,16,17]. In our study, one limiting issue in the derivation of a multi-year
    countrywide agricultural classification was the data availability from the earlier
    Landsat generations 5 and 7. Though, the ESTARFM framework includes an automated
    filling of cloud gaps and can thus make use of also partially cloud covered scenes,
    for some tiles and years there was no or not enough data available. Especially
    for the year 2007, no Landsat-7 data were available for the southeast of the country
    and for several other areas the cloud coverage over the whole year was at exceptionally
    high levels. Thus, the classification of this year could only be used for local
    analyses. However, the classification of 2014 has shown that limited data availability
    should not be an issue for future applications of the developed methodology since
    the Landsat-8 sensor delivers sufficient amounts of input data. In addition, data
    from the Sentinel-2 satellites [61] will be an option enhancing future data availability
    for the presented methodology. For a repeated application of the developed methodology
    for monitoring purposes, the automation of the classification procedure and the
    automated generation or update of the reference dataset would be desirable. Such
    an operational framework could significantly improve the overall processing time
    from data download to the final maps. However, this is beyond the scope of this
    study which aimed at the development of the general classification approach and
    the delineation of agricultural area for certain years. A further challenge of
    the applied approach was the reference data collection. A reference dataset of
    land use for multiple years covering entire Burkina Faso is so far not available
    and thus, this information was collected from high resolution Google Earth images.
    Since in Google Earth there are often no multi temporal datasets available for
    a single year of interest, it can be difficult to visually distinguish active
    cropland from crop-fallow rotation systems or even recently abandoned land. The
    aim of this study was to delineate total agricultural area comprising fallow and
    intensive pasture and not strictly limit the classification to harvested crop
    area. The inclusion of these types of agricultural area provides a valuable picture
    on the overall need and expansion of land for agricultural production in Burkina
    Faso. However, the derived dense ESTARFM time series have the potential to also
    distinguish harvested crop area, if a suitable reference dataset would be available.
    A comparison of classification results to official statistics of agricultural
    area is difficult since they are either so called ‘manual estimations’ or focus
    on only harvested area [1]. For the year 2001, the FAO estimates that 105,700
    km² were used as agricultural area in Burkina Faso and 123,000 km² in 2013 while
    numbers for 2014 are currently unavailable [1]. However, in these values a constant
    number of 60,000 km² for ‘permanent meadows and pastures’ is included. Such a
    stable expanse of rangelands seems rather unrealistic since several processes
    like the conversion to cropland or the exploitation of new areas should alter
    this extent. According to the FAO, an area of 49,600 km² of primary crops was
    harvested in Burkina Faso in 2001 and 70,200 km² in 2013 with missing numbers
    for 2014 [1]. These values indicate the strong increase of agriculturally used
    area during the past years, which is also visible in the classification results
    of this study. 5.2. Land Cover Changes in the Context of Socio-Economic Development
    While the rapid population growth in Burkina Faso seems to be the main driver
    for the expansion of rainfed agricultural area, the development of plantations
    and irrigation systems requires investments which are not feasible for the majority
    of Burkinabe. The considerable growth of plantation area and the formation of
    distinct plantation shapes (compare Section 4.1.1) indicate a substantial driving
    force of development and a professionalization of tree crop agriculture in the
    region. And indeed, this progress goes in line with the establishment of a predominantly
    Fairtrade business of cashew nuts and mangos in Burkina Faso during the past years.
    Since the beginning of the 21st century, several external organizations started
    to invest in and promote the development of plantations of cashew nuts and mangos.
    Amongst others, the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) initiated
    the African Cashew initiative (ACi) [32] optimizing the whole value chain of cashew
    production and distribution for several West African countries including Burkina
    Faso. Also in the mango production, professionalization was advanced by international
    projects as well as the implementation of local companies such as Fruiteq [33,62,63].
    These promoted the establishment of farmer co-operatives, the training in mango
    cultivation, as well as the transport and Fairtrade marketing in Europe. Though
    there are other tree crops in Burkina Faso, e.g., citrus fruits or other nuts,
    these are obviously not responsible for the significant growth of plantation area
    since their numbers rather stagnate or decrease over the period of investigation
    [1]. In contrast, the success of these international projects can be seen in the
    rise of trade values and amount of exported cashew nuts and mangos, a development
    which is well reflected in the observed expansion of plantation area (Figure 14).
    Figure 14. Amount (left) and trade value (right) of exported cashews and mangos
    from Burkina Faso as well as the total observed plantation area for the years
    2001, 2007, and 2014; error bars describe the possible range of plantation area
    due to data gaps in the classifications [34]. While in 2001, the amount of exported
    cashews and mangos from Burkina Faso was at 224 and 580 tons, respectively, it
    rose rapidly to 74,303 and 7256 tons in 2014 [34]. Also the trade value of Burkinabe
    cashews and mangos increased considerably from 0.73 to 42.85 million US$ for cashews
    and from 0.56 million to 8.54 million US$ for mangos [34]. While the development
    of the cashew sector is even more remarkable than that of mangos, it can be noted
    that there has been a price increase (US$ per ton) for mangos from Burkina Faso.
    This could be attributed to rising world market prices but also to the improved
    quality of Burkinabe mangos and their Fairtrade marketing. Besides the expansion
    of plantation area, also the increase in irrigated agricultural areas is remarkable
    (compare Section 4.1.2). In recent years, the government of Burkina Faso has been
    investing considerable amounts of money in the development of irrigation systems
    in the framework of their National Programme for the Rural Sector (PNSR) [64].
    In addition, several international organizations are promoting irrigated agriculture
    within local projects in Burkina Faso. One example is the above mentioned Bagré
    dam located about 140 km southeast of Ouagadougou (Figure 7). Within the Bagré
    Growth Pole Project, the World Bank, the Global Water Initiative (GWI) and others
    are developing irrigation infrastructure and are advising and promoting smallholder
    farming in the region [58,59,65]. The success of these efforts can be seen in
    an expansion of irrigated areas by about 300% to 37.28 km² in 2014. However, this
    value is still far below the estimated potential irrigable area for the region
    of 299 km² [58]. 5.3. Mapping of Agricultural Expansion for the Planning and Monitoring
    of Measures The results of this study show links between agricultural expansion
    and the rapidly growing population of Burkina Faso. While the population increased
    by about 40% in almost all provinces between 2001 and 2014, the agricultural area
    nearly doubled and spread into all remote and previously almost unused regions.
    Until now, there has been an overall increase in agricultural area per person
    in the rural regions of Burkina Faso (from 0.63 ha to 0.88 ha during the period
    of investigation). However, some provinces which were already intensively cultivated
    in 2001 show a decrease in agricultural area per person. By the year 2030, it
    is estimated that Burkina Faso could reach its limit of arable land [5] and the
    population is expected to grow from 17 million people in 2014 to more than 26
    million people in 2030 and even to about 41 million in 2050 [1]. Against this
    background, an overall positive trend in agricultural area per person cannot hold
    for a longer time. In addition, in the calculation of this factor, only the rural
    population was included since most of the smallholders cultivate for self-subsistence
    with only casual access to the market [4]. However, in order to improve food security
    and to avoid booming food prices during drought years, a self-sustaining agriculture
    would be desirable in Burkina Faso, meaning that also the increasing urban population
    would have to be taken into account in such a calculation. In this case, the agricultural
    area per person would be considerably lower. In combination with additional statistical
    data, the derived results could be valuable information for the analysis of regional
    migration and rural-urban development. As highlighted by the analyses of Section
    4.4, the pressure on protected areas has increased significantly in Burkina Faso
    during recent years. With population growth and agricultural expansion as the
    main drivers, some of the less guarded reserves have considerably decreased in
    size or even vanished completely. Because of an increase of agricultural area
    and rural settlements in the surroundings of the protected areas, the suitability
    of these areas as a habitat for a number of species is also decreasing. Maintaining
    a critical size and connectivity between natural habitats is important for many
    species to provide crucial habitat functions and to guarantee genetic exchange
    between populations and preserve biodiversity [66]. For the protection of the
    remaining natural reserves, the local communities have to be involved in order
    to prevent them from exploiting the forests for firewood or expansion of agricultural
    areas [60]. This is currently under development on the basis of funds from the
    Forest Investment Program (FIP) of the Climate Investment Funds financed by the
    World Bank [67]. Burkina Faso is one of eight pilot countries, given a 30 million
    US$ grant to reduce deforestation and promote sustainable forest management. The
    Tiogo classified forest, investigated in Section 4.4 is one of six focus reserves
    of this program within Burkina Faso. Since the agricultural expansion will have
    to come to an end in the near future, there is a serious need to increase the
    efficient and sustainable use of existing agricultural areas. However, since the
    1960s, the cereal productivity of Burkina Faso only rose very slowly from about
    0.4 tons per hectare and year to approximately 1.16 t/ha/year [1]. Other developing
    and thresholding countries like e.g., Brazil improved their cereal productivity
    in the same time from 1.34 t/ha/year to about 4.8 t/ha/year while the productivity
    in Western Europe is already at more than 7 t/ha/year. Several international projects
    like the examples given in Section 5.2. promote the development of sustainable
    and more efficient agricultural areas. However, most of them are focusing on geographically
    small areas rather than targeting the majority of rainfed agricultural regions.
    For this purpose, a countrywide approach is necessary. During the past decade,
    the government of Burkina Faso made a considerable effort to support and develop
    the agricultural sector. More than 10% of the national budget was allocated to
    agriculture [4]. In the framework of the Rural Development Strategy (SDR), staple
    crop production was supported by subsidies on fertilizer, by distributing improved
    seeds and by supporting the improvement of irrigation systems [4]. These efforts
    will especially advance an intensification of existing agricultural areas and
    improve agricultural productivity. By promoting local focus areas such as the
    above mentioned Bagré Growth Pole Project, the government wants to attract private
    investment and initiate positive effects on the rest of the economy [4]. However,
    most of the national investments still focus on the production of cotton which
    is the major agricultural export commodity in Burkina Faso. It has to be awaited
    to see if these efforts have a considerable impact on the broad agricultural community
    and on the improvement of food security and sustainability in the country. The
    continuous application of the developed methodology could play a crucial role
    in the monitoring of Burkina Faso’s efforts to develop a sustainable land management
    and to protect the remaining natural reserves. An annual or biennial mapping of
    Burkina Faso’s focus areas and the development of the countrywide agricultural
    area in combination with regional population numbers could detect discrepancies
    between planning and implementation and identify potential hotspots of undesirable
    processes. In addition, the developed methodology could also improve the agricultural
    monitoring efforts planned by ESA’s S2-Agri project [68]. This project explores
    methods to generate cropland maps from Sentinel-2 time series on a frequent basis
    applicable for various regions on the globe. However, recent tests showed difficulties
    for their focus site in Burkina Faso due to the small-scale extensive farming
    practices as well as the persistent cloud coverage in the region [69,70]. The
    presented approach for the generation of a gap-free high temporal and spatial
    resolution time series with the ESTARFM framework could contribute to overcoming
    these issues and increase the classification accuracies in such difficult regions.
    6. Conclusions In this study, the ESTARFM framework was applied for the generation
    of a high temporal (8-day) and high spatial (30 m) resolution time series for
    the country of Burkina Faso, with an area of approx. 274.000 km². The fused time
    series were further used as a basis for the delineation of agricultural area in
    a spatial resolution of 30 m for entire Burkina Faso and for three years—2001,
    2007, and 2014. To our knowledge, there is no other national product available
    at this spatial, temporal, and thematic resolution with an equal quality. Prior
    studies outline the challenges in the derivation of agricultural area from remote
    sensing data in West Africa [17,18,19,48]. The predominant small-scale rainfed
    subsistence farming and the low productivity of the fields complicates the separation
    of agricultural area from other land use and cover types. Despite these difficulties,
    the overall accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) of the presented
    results indicate the well-functioning of the method applied here. The possibility
    to use the whole phenological cycle of NDVI in a sufficiently high spatial resolution
    as input for the classification is a key factor for the delineation of agricultural
    area in the region. Furthermore, the presented results give insight into the development
    of plantations, the establishment of irrigation systems, and the protection of
    natural reserves in Burkina Faso. This information can be important for decision
    makers in order to understand and quantify if recently initiated measures for
    the development of agricultural systems have the intended effects. For this purpose,
    the mapping and monitoring with the developed method could also be continued for
    subsequent years. The results and analyses presented in this study highlight major
    challenges in terms of food production systems and food security Burkina Faso
    is facing and will face in the future. The massive expansion of agricultural area
    (from 61,100 km² in 2001 to 116,900 km² in 2014) is pushing towards the limit
    of available arable land and potentially more and more unsuitable regions will
    be used for cultivation. With a rapidly increasing population, this expansion
    is likely to continue if the productivity will not be improved significantly in
    the near future. These trends are also threatening the remnant natural reserves
    of Burkina Faso with illegal logging and cultivation on protected land. In future,
    the introduction of new satellite systems such as Sentinel-2 and -3 should improve
    the input data availability and facilitate subsequent applications of the developed
    approach for the delineation of agricultural area. This study also highlights
    the great potential of the dense time series generated with the ESTARFM framework
    beyond its use for agricultural studies in Burkina Faso [24]. Further applications,
    where a combination of high temporal and spatial resolution would be essential,
    could be the analysis of land degradation or changes in the land surface phenology
    in Burkina Faso [24]. Acknowledgments This work was conducted in the WASCAL (West

  explanation: The paper evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the AquaCrop model
    for predicting the yield of automated, IoT-based irrigation systems for sweet
    potato cultivation. Specifically, it examines the model's ability to simulate
    canopy cover, biomass, and yield under different water treatments (irrigated and
    rainfed) and across various cultivars. The study highlights the importance of
    accurate weather data, appropriate parameterization, and the use of reliable tools
    (such as the Automated Canopy Estimator) for canopy cover estimation to improve
    the model's performance.

    days after planting WUE water use efficiency Sweet potato is a dicotyledonous
    herbaceous trailing vine of the Convolvulaceae family that is characterized by
    its starchy storage roots and lobed leaves (Caribbean Agricultural Research and
    Development Institute, 2010). It is regarded worldwide as the sixth (fifth in
    developing countries) most important crop (http://cipotato.org/sweetpotato-1/)
    and in Jamaica is the third most widely grown root tuber (http://rada.gov.jm/?p=462).
    The expansion of its cultivation and use is seen as essential for the future development
    of Jamaica''s agricultural sector (http://rada.gov.jm/?p=462) and for the food
    and nutrition security of the entire Caribbean region (Hutchinson, 2013) through
    reduced reliance on imported cereals. Agricultural production in the Caribbean
    is dominated by small open field holdings that are highly reliant on rainfall
    with little supplemental irrigation (http://www.rlc.fao.org/). The rainfall climatology
    of the Caribbean is characterized by dry winters and wet summers (Taylor and Alfaro,
    2005). The wet season is bimodal, with peaks in May to June and September to October
    (Chen and Taylor, 2002) separated by a brief dry period in July and August referred
    to as the “midsummer drought” (Magaña et al. 1999; Curtis and Gamble, 2008). During
    the late rainfall season (late August–November) as much as 40% of the total annual
    rainfall is received (Taylor et al., 2011; Climate Studies Group, Mona, 2012).
    There is strong year-to-year variability in annual rainfall amounts due to modulation
    by gradients in sea surface temperatures in and between the tropical Atlantic
    and Pacific (Taylor et al., 2002). Droughts are of particular concern for farmers
    in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean given the reliance on rainfall (Gamble et al.,
    2010). In this context, sweet potato assumes great importance for food and nutrition
    security. The advantages of sweet potato are its adaptability to different growing
    conditions, its low susceptibility to natural hazards including hurricanes and
    other tropical systems (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute,
    2010; Abdissa et al., 2011), and its innate drought-tolerant properties, including
    shading of the soil by its extensive canopy and an extensive and deep root system
    (Romero and Baigorria, 2008; Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute,
    2010; Stathers et al., 2013; Kunstelj et al., 2013a, 2013b). The vulnerability
    of the climate-sensitive Caribbean agricultural sector is expected to be exacerbated
    under climate change, and crop modeling has been identified as part of a wider
    adaptation strategy (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean,
    2011; Hutchinson, 2013). Crop models are useful for their ability to estimate
    potential yields under varying environmental scenarios such as might occur under
    current and/or future climate change assuming optimal farm management. This, however,
    requires crop models that are calibrated and validated for the local conditions.
    With the exception of Cuba, there is little or no use of crop models in the Caribbean
    (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2011; Hoogenboom, 2012).
    The objective of this study was to parameterize the AquaCrop model for field-grown
    irrigated and rainfed sweet potato using its conservative parameters. AquaCrop
    is a crop water productivity model developed by the Land and Water Division of
    the FAO. The conceptual framework, underlying principles, and distinctive features
    of AquaCrop were documented by Steduto et al. (2009), while its structure and
    algorithms have been documented by Raes et al. (2009). AquaCrop simulates the
    yield response to water of herbaceous crops and is particularly suited to address
    conditions where water is a key limiting factor in crop production. It uses few
    input variables, which require comparatively simple methods for their determination
    (Steduto et al., 2008). The model uses canopy cover instead of leaf area index
    to monitor canopy expansion and has a good balance between simplicity and robustness,
    making it well suited for use in the Caribbean where agro-meteorological data
    are scarce. The global applicability of AquaCrop is dependent on its being tested
    in a variety of locations under differing soil conditions, crops, agronomic practices,
    and climatic conditions (Sam-Amoah et al., 2013). For example, the calibration
    and evaluation of the performance of AquaCrop has been done for cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) in northern Syria (Farahani et al., 2009; García-Vila et al., 2009),
    for maize (Zea mays L.) in various locations (Heng et al., 2009; Hsiao et al.,
    2009), for hot pepper (Capsicum sp.) in south-central Ghana (Sam-Amoah et al.,
    2013), and for potato (Solanum tuberosum L., known as Irish potato in Jamaica)
    in Lima, Peru (Izzi, 2008). However, like most of the other crop models in current
    use, AquaCrop has not been parameterized for root crops like sweet potato or for
    the Caribbean region. In this study, field trials were conducted at two sites
    in Jamaica for the parameterization of AquaCrop over two crop seasons. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS Site Characteristics and Biometry Parameters for the model were determined
    from data collected from field tests undertaken at Devon, Manchester, in 2012
    and 2013 and Ebony Park, Clarendon, in 2013, located in different agroecological
    regions of south-central Jamaica (Fig. 1). General site characteristics are summarized
    in Table 1. Devon has clay loam soil with lower total available water content
    than the clay soil at Ebony Park. The full details of the soil characteristics

    included three popularly cultivated sweet potato cultivars (Ganja, Uplifta, and
    Yellow Belly) and two water treatments, irrigated and rainfed. Treatments were
    allocated in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with five replications.
    At each location there were two sets of experimental RCBs, one irrigated and the
    other rainfed. The plots at Devon were 26 m2 (20.7 m2 in 2012), with larger plots
    at Ebony Park (53 m2). In all cases, sweet potato slips were planted on both sides
    of four raised ridges at a spacing of 30.5 cm (1 ft) on the ridge. Before planting,
    the slips were soaked in a synthetic organophosphate pesticide (O,O-diethyl O-[6-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl]
    phosphorothioate) solution (0.5% in water) for 20 min and then drained (as recommended
    by the Rural Agriculture Development Authority). Treatment of the planting material
    was conducted to reduce the risk of infestation of the sweet potato weevil (Cylas
    formicarius). Row spacing was 1.08 and 1.55 m for Devon and Ebony Park, respectively.
    Drip irrigation lines (1.27-cm diameter) were run along the length of each ridge
    in the irrigated plots. For planting material, potato slips of 30- to 40-cm (12–15-inch)
    length were obtained from vines of nursery-grown sweet potato, mainly from the
    apical regions. This is in keeping with recommendations for field planting in
    Jamaica (Fielding and Ryder, 1995; Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development
    Institute, 2010). The slips used as planting material developed roots and new
    foliage after being transplanted. There were up to 224 plants in each plot, sufficient
    to allow periodic destructive sampling. Fertilization was done once in each crop
    season at the recommended rate. Weather Data and Irrigation The sites are part
    of the network of stations maintained by the Meteorological Service, Jamaica,
    and have an automatic weather station (AWS) measuring multiple parameters and
    reporting at intervals upward from 30 min. The AWS provided the daily weather
    parameters needed for the climate component of the AquaCrop model in 2013. For
    the crop at Devon (2011/2012), data were used from an automatic weather station
    (at Kirkvine) located 14 km away. Variables measured included maximum and minimum
    temperatures, rainfall, (net) solar radiation (not available for 2011/2012), wind,
    and relative humidity (not available for Ebony Park). The variables (except rainfall)
    were used to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for each site
    using the Penman–Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998) and the FAO ETo calculator
    (Raes, 2009). This ETo represents an upper limit for evapotranspiration (assuming
    no water shortage), which is used by the AquaCrop model to simulate daily crop
    evapotranspiration. In 2013, the mean daily ETo for the crop season at Ebony Park
    was higher than at Devon (Table 3; Fig. 2). Ebony Park had a mean crop season
    (2013) temperature that was 5°C warmer than Devon (Table 3). Table 3. Crop season

    sites is shown in Fig. 1, and the climatological mean rainfall (1971–2000) for
    the sites is given in Table 1. On average, Devon (Manchester) receives nearly
    twice as much rainfall as Ebony Park, but both locations exhibit the characteristic
    bimodal rainfall pattern (Fig. 3). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Monthly pattern
    of rainfall for field sites (1994–2013). Total rainfall during the 2011/2012 cropping
    season at Devon was 622 mm (Table 3; Fig. 4). The rainfall occurring in the first
    59 d after planting (3 Nov.– 31 Dec. 2011) was 71 mm. This amount was only 34%
    of the 30-yr (1971–2000) mean rainfall for these months at this location (Fig.
    4 and 5). As a consequence, severe drought conditions (as classified by the Meteorological
    Service, Jamaica) were experienced during this period. Irrigation of 197 mm was
    applied in this cropping season, with the highest amounts supplied during the
    drought period (Fig. 5). In the 2013 cropping season, rainfall was more evenly
    distributed and no drought was experienced. Rainfall summed to 645 mm, and this
    was supplemented by irrigation of only 44 mm as described below. Figure 4 Open
    in figure viewer Monthly precipitation and irrigation for the 2011/2012 crop season
    at Devon, Jamaica. During the period of drought stress in the first 59 d after
    planting (November–December 2011), site rainfall was 34% of the 30-yr (1971–2000)
    mean rainfall. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Daily rainfall (black bars) and
    irrigation (gray bars) measured for days after planting (DAP) at (a) Devon 2011/12,
    (b) Devon 2013, and (c) Ebony Park 2013 in Jamaica. Immediately after planting,
    when the plants were most sensitive to water stress, both irrigated and rainfed
    plots were watered (Fielding and Ryder, 1995; Caribbean Agricultural Research
    and Development Institute, 2010). Initial soil moisture was therefore at field
    capacity. In the first crop season at Devon, irrigation was automated by an inline
    timer (2-cm [3/4-inch] valve, 106 L [28 gallons] min−1, battery-operated digital
    controller) that triggered watering of the crops four times per day. Irrigation
    (mean of 4.5 mm d−1) was applied for a total of 43 d. In the 2013 crop season,
    a different irrigation schedule was used. Davis Vantage Pro Plus AWS moisture
    probes were used to monitor soil moisture (Davis Instruments, 2006). Irrigation
    was done once daily, only when a reading of 30 kPa (30 cbar) was recorded for
    soil moisture tension. The total number of irrigated days was 11, with a mean
    daily application of 4 mm. This new schedule, along with the more evenly distributed
    rainfall, resulted in the large difference in irrigated amounts (greater than
    four times more in 2012) between these two seasons. Planting took place at Ebony
    Park only in 2013, and at this location the total rainfall for the crop was 470
    mm with an irrigation total of 432 mm. Irrigation was done when moisture tension
    of 30 kPa (30 cbar) was registered on the onsite irrometer (Model R 24). The mean
    daily irrigation was 6 mm, and application lasted a total of 72 d. Crop Parameters:
    Yield, Biomass, and Canopy Cover Above- and belowground biomass were assessed
    destructively at least two times during the crop season and at final harvest.
    Yields were calculated from the cultivar average of four to eight plants from
    each plot and extrapolated to give yield per unit area in megagrams per hectare
    (1 Mg = 1 tonne). For the first crop at Devon in 2012, there was selective harvesting,
    when plants with marketable tubers were chosen for measurement of yield. Thereafter,
    for Devon and Ebony Park in 2013, all tubers harvested in the sample were measured
    without separation of marketability. Samples were dried to constant weight to
    obtain dry mass. Cultivar averages were determined from the mean of all five replicates
    as well as one cross-cultivar average calculated for each treatment. Measured
    values (observed) were compared with those calculated (simulated) by AquaCrop
    (Hsiao et al., 2011). Canopy cover (CC) was measured every 20 to 30 d during the
    crop season using a combination of above-canopy digital photography and one of
    two software packages. The photographs were taken with a digital camera (Fujifilm
    12.2 megapixels, 18× optical zoom Finepix S1800 lens). A new approach developed
    in the course of this research was used to estimate canopy cover (Coy et al.,
    unpublished data, 2013). The new technique is called the Automated Canopy Estimator
    (ACE) and was applied at all sites. The ACE converts a digital photograph from
    red–green–blue (RGB) to the CIE L*a*b* color space (Wright, 1929; Guild, 1932;
    Commission Internationale de l''Eclairage, 1931). One major benefit of working
    in the CIE L*a*b* is that it is device independent and therefore a single approach
    can be used in the segmentation of captured images without the negative effects
    of differing color representations. Images are segmented based on an assessment
    of the bimodality of the probability distribution of the a* color values. The
    method was rigorously tested against ground truth segmentations of oat (Avena
    sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), rape (Brassica napus L.), and maize.
    The estimated CC values yielded high coefficients of correlation, highlighting
    the technique''s consistency in estimation across different crop types. In all
    cases, the mean CC for each cultivar was obtained from the average of the five
    replicates in each treatment (irrigated and rainfed separately) for use in the
    AquaCrop model. One mean value across all cultivars was also obtained for each
    treatment. Data Analysis Goodness of fit of the simulated results with the measured
    field test data was assessed on the basis of two statistical measures: the root
    mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of efficiency (E) (Nash and Sutcliffe,
    1970): (1) (2) where Si and Oi are the simulated and observed values of samples
    taken during the season (for biomass, canopy cover or yield) or at the end of
    the season (e.g., tuber yield), N is the number of observations, and Ō is the
    mean value of Oi (Heng et al., 2009). The RMSE measures the overall mean deviation
    between simulated and observed values. The closer the value is to zero, the better
    the model performance. The coefficient of efficiency measures how the overall
    deviation between observed and simulated values departs from the overall deviation
    between observed values Oi and their mean value (Ō) during the crop season. The
    values are of E are unitless and can range from –∞ to 1. The closer the values
    are to 1, the better the model''s simulation efficiency. Similar statistical analyses
    (comparing measured and simulated values using E and RMSE) have been used successfully
    by a number of other AquaCrop parameterization studies (Heng et al., 2009; Hsiao
    et al., 2009; Farahani et al., 2009). The deviation percentage (Hsiao et al.,
    2009), defined as Deviation = [(simulated – measured)/measured] ×100, was also
    used as a measure of how well the model performed. Plots with experimental data
    are presented with standard deviation bars to give an indication of the random
    error size. Model Parameters Conservative Parameters The AquaCrop model Version
    4.0 (2012) was used in the parameterization. The approach taken was to calibrate
    the model with the 2 yr (2011/12 and 2013) of data from Devon, Manchester. During
    the simulations, emphasis was placed on the progression of green canopy cover,
    total and belowground biomass, and to a lesser extent total reference evapotranspiration,
    after Hsiao et al. (2009). Conservative parameters are those that vary little
    among different cultivars of the same crop and so can be applied directly (unaltered)
    or with minimal adjustments even across different agroecological zones (Raes et
    al., 2009; Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2012). Values for these parameters
    may be obtained from the literature or previous studies, but in the case of sweet
    potato there were no previous values available. Initial (best guess) values for
    conservative parameters of sweet potato were therefore selected from values reported
    in the literature for Irish potato (calibrated for Lima, Peru) and knowledge gained
    of the crop. This approach, i.e., using the closest crop (Irish potato) to calibrate
    a totally new crop (sweet potato), was recommended by Steduto et al. (2012). Refinements
    to these initial values were obtained through trial and error after repeated simulations
    to ensure the best match of simulated to measured variables. By taking the average
    across cultivars, one set of conservative values was obtained and used in calendar
    mode for emergence date, physiological maturity, and senescence. Some differences
    were noted among the cultivars, especially Yellow Belly, which appeared to senescence
    earlier than the others. Notwithstanding, mean values were observed to give more
    favorable results than values for the individual cultivars. The same set of conservative
    parameters was used across treatments. Once reasonable agreement was obtained
    with the measured values, the model was switched to the growing degree day (GDD)
    mode and more adjustments made to the parameters. The final set of parameters
    was tested against data from the crop at Ebony Park (2013). This followed the
    recommended approach for parameterization of AquaCrop by Steduto et al. (2012).
    The full set of conservative parameters is given in Table 4. In addition, the
    following are noted about parameter choices: Canopy parameters: Canopy cover,
    as determined by vine growth, varies for each of the three growth phases of sweet
    potato, with characteristics of the initial phase of slow vine growth and rapid
    growth of adventitious roots, an intermediate phase of rapid growth of vines and
    an increase in leaf area and storage root initiation; and the final stage of bulking
    of tubers but no further vine growth (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development
    Institute, 2010). The size of individual leaves also varies among cultivars from
    small almost divided leaves for Ganja to large-lobed leaves for Uplifta. Both
    factors pose a challenge to estimating canopy cover parameters. The default value
    for a high initial canopy cover was adjusted to a best-fit value of 0.9% for the
    initial values for canopy cover (CCo). The canopy growth coefficient (CGC), which
    determines canopy development from emergence to maximum canopy cover, was determined
    by the CGC estimator spreadsheet of the FAO. This was later adjusted until the
    best match with measured values was obtained. The measured maximum canopy value
    from the field tests (94%) was used, while the canopy decline coefficient (CDC,
    which controls the rate of canopy decline after senescence), also was adjusted
    until the best match was obtained. Normalized water productivity: Water productivity
    (WP) is measured in grams of biomass per square meter and per millimeter of cumulated
    water transpired (or kilograms of biomass per cubic meter of water transpired)
    during the time period in which the biomass is produced (Raes et al., 2011, Steduto
    et al., 2012). In AquaCrop, WP is normalized for atmospheric demand and air CO2
    concentrations. Used in this way, it behaves conservatively and expresses the
    strong relationship between photosynthetic CO2 assimilation or biomass production
    and transpiration independently of the climatic conditions. Steduto et al. (2007)
    suggested that the conservative nature of WP is fundamental to the robustness
    of the model. Water productivity for C3 crops like sweet potato lies in the range
    of 15 to 20 g m−2 mm−1 (Raes et al., 2011). Using this range, the most appropriate
    value derived for sweet potato from the experimental data was 20.0 g m−2 mm−1.
    Water stress parameters and harvest index (HI): Adjustments were made to all the
    default stress parameters used for Irish potato while noting the moderate sensitivity
    of sweet potato to water stress and the limitation to only two water treatments
    (irrigated vs. rainfed). The effects of water stress on the HI are categorized
    in two stages. Before yield formation, there is a moderately positive (8%) increase,
    and during yield formation there are two (sub) adjustments: (i) for leaf expansion
    (1.16, moderately positive) and (ii) for stomatal closure (0.92, slightly negative).
    The value of reference harvest index (HIo) used was 55% based on the best fit
    between measured and simulated data. Aeration stress: Sweet potato is regarded
    as being moderately tolerant to aeration stress. For waterlogging (aeration) stress,
    a value of –4% of the saturated volume was used. Growing degree days (GDD): The
    simulations of GDD used a base of 15°C and an upper temperature of 35°C. These
    values were chosen based on published work on the base temperature as well the
    optimal range for sweet potato production (Romero and Baigorria, 2008; Ramirez,
    1992; Villordon et al., 2009; Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development
    Institute, 2010; Stathers et al., 2013). The effect of temperature stress could
    not be tested because temperatures remained within the optimal range for most
    of the crop season in both years. Table 4. Conservative (constant) parameters

    GDD 875 could vary slightly among cultivars User-Specific Parameters User-specific
    parameters are those that must be directly entered by the user based on accurate
    data and knowledge of the crop. The following considerations were made when choosing
    parameter values for emergence time, rooting depth, canopy senescence and physiological
    maturity. Emergence time: This is the time by which 90% of seedlings or new shoots
    have emerged from the soil. It is regarded as the starting time (first day of
    appearance) of the crop canopy. The emergence time was fairly uniform across the
    cultivars, and the mean value of 77 GDD was used. Rooting depth: Sweet potato
    is considered a deep-rooted crop, with the maximum effective rooting depth generally
    being 1 to 1.5 m (Allen et al., 1998). In this study, we found that roots exceeded
    these limits. The measured value of 1.6 m was used for both Devon and Ebony Park.
    Canopy senescence and physiological maturity: The time to senescence was taken
    as 1091 GDD. It was taken to be the time when yellowing was noticed in >40% of
    leaves. However, it was noted that late-season rainfall veiled some of the senescence,
    especially at Ebony Park, where significant green canopy (overlying older senescent
    leaves) was evident even at harvest. Physiological maturity varied slightly among
    the different cultivars and in general exceeded the 120 calendar days reported
    for local cultivars by the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute
    (2010). The crop season at both sites lasted in excess of 130 d, and maturity
    was taken as 1294 GDD. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of the simulation are
    presented and discussed by location. For each cropping season, comparisons were
    made between the simulated and measured values of canopy cover, (total) biomass,
    and yield. Additionally, some results are presented for measured (by AWS) vs.
    simulated daily crop ETo at Devon in 2013. In the experiment, as explained above,
    three cultivars were included, two high yielding (Uplifta and Ganja) and one lower
    yielding (Yellow Belly). Besides serving as a measure of the robustness of the
    model (because AquaCrop simulations pre-suppose modern high-yielding cultivars),
    the inclusion of Yellow Belly was to assess how its deeper roots might affect
    drought tolerance. Devon, Manchester 2012 Crop Season In the first crop season
    (2011/2012), AquaCrop underestimated canopy cover for both the irrigated and rainfed
    treatments for about 66 d after planting (DAP), though results were slightly better
    for the rainfed plots (Fig. 6a and 6b). However, the maximum canopy cover value
    for both rainfed and irrigated sweet potato (occurring at 122 DAP in the model)
    was closely simulated. The large disparities between initial values resulted in
    large RMSE and relatively low E values (negative for the irrigated treatment),
    as shown in Table 5. The discrepancies might be attributable to a number of factors:
    the severe drought stress that was experienced in the first 60 DAP and the differential
    response of the cultivars to drought, which was not captured by AquaCrop. Several
    studies (Bourke, 1984; Martin and Carmer, 1985; Fielding and Ryder, 1995; Ku et
    al., 2008; Lebot, 2009) have reported that sweet potato water requirements are
    site and time specific. These researchers also noted that cultivars differ in
    their response to stress conditions including drought. AquaCrop does not simulate
    well under high-drought-stress conditions (Heng et al., 2009; Hsiao et al., 2009;
    Patel et al., 2011). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs. measured

    Further, the onsite weather station was inoperable during this crop season and
    ETo was calculated using data from the nearest station (Kirkvine Bauxite Company),
    which is 14 km away. The absence of solar radiation in this data set seemingly
    affected the estimation of ETo, given the known dependence of ETo on this parameter
    for accurate estimates (Allen et al., 1998; Droogers and Allen, 2002; Alkaeed
    et al., 2006; Rahimikhoob, 2014). There was no measurement of canopy cover after
    the onset of senescence in this crop season, so the performance of the model during
    this period was not assessed for this variable. The simulation of biomass is shown
    in Fig. 6c and 6d. There was good (E = 0.74) agreement between simulated and measured
    total biomass for the initial and final values for the irrigated treatment (Table
    5). The irrigated sample taken at 122 DAP was inadvertently lost. Figure 6d shows
    a divergence between measured and simulated values of biomass in the rainfed plots
    as the season progressed. In general, rainfed yields were higher than those of
    the irrigated plants (Table 6). It appears that the low rainfall during the first
    third of the crop life did not adversely affect yields of the rainfed plants.
    On the other hand, it seems that irrigation did not benefit tuber development
    and possibly contributed to a reduction in yield relative to the rainfed plants.
    This is in agreement with observations made by Lebot (2009) in their research
    in Taiwan that over-irrigation tended to reduce storage root yields in areas of
    high rainfall, whereas a short period of drought stress appeared to stimulate
    root development. Table 6. Simulated vs. measured values of total biomass and

    of three cultivars. While an adequate water supply through rainfall or irrigation
    is essential for the optimum development of storage roots, excess water can result
    in poor aeration. Like Lebot (2009), it was noted in this study that if sweet
    potato was irrigated when the total available water in the soil was depleted to
    about 40%, the highest yields were produced. There are exceptions, however, especially
    in areas where rainfall is usually low. For example, at another location in the
    dry southern fringe of Jamaica (Bodles, St. Catherine) a lack of rain was experienced,
    and without irrigation the rainfed plants died due to severe drought stress. There
    was a large deviation between the simulated and observed final yields (–43.6%
    for irrigated, –76.0% for rainfed) (Table 6). The lower standard deviation (14.9
    for rainfed vs. 5.7 for irrigated) for the irrigated treatment suggests that irrigation
    reduced the variability of yield by allowing more uniform development of tubers
    (Table 6). The reduced variability seemingly increased the potential for making
    better yield predictions. The poor simulation results and large deviation in final
    yields is likely to have been influenced by the high yield variations occurring
    even within the same field trial of different cultivars, which is a known trait
    of sweet potato (Bourke, 1984; Martin and Carmer, 1985; Fielding and Ryder, 1995;
    Ku et al., 2008; Lebot 2009). Further, the demonstrated inability of AquaCrop
    under high-water-stress conditions noted in other studies (Heng et al., 2009;
    Hsiao et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2011) could also have affected the results.
    The lack of solar radiation data in the computation of ETo is also noted again.
    The selective harvesting of plants with marketable tubers also inflated the final
    yields and exaggerated the disparities between measured and simulated data. The
    simulated water use efficiency (WUE) and ETo for rainfed and irrigated sweet potato
    was calculated at all sites using the simulated values from AquaCrop (Table 7).
    The WUE is a measure of how efficiently the crop is using water for yield or biomass
    production and can be expressed as the ratio of biomass (or yield) to evapotranspiration.
    Although the ETo for the irrigated treatment was considerably higher (by 188 mm)
    than for the rainfed treatment, the WUE was nearly identical for both yield and
    biomass. This suggests that WUE can be optimized at this location without irrigation.
    Table 7. Total reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and water use efficiency (WUE)
    simulated by AquaCrop for rainfed and irrigated sweet potato for two sites in
    Jamaica. The WUE values were calculated using simulated values of biomass or yield.
    The ETo data for Devon 2012 was obtained from the Kirkvine station 14 km away
    because the onsite automated weather station at Devon was inoperable in 2012.
    All other data were obtained from onsite stations. Year Treatment Total ETo WUE

    2013 Crop Season Model performance for canopy cover was much improved over 2011/2012,
    with greater agreement between simulated and measured values for the entire crop
    season (Fig. 7). This is also seen in the smaller measures of RMSE (10.9 and 4.5%
    for irrigated and rainfed, respectively) and higher values of E (0.86 for irrigated
    and 0.97 for rainfed) than for the previous crop season (Table 5). The use of
    weather data obtained onsite and more evenly distributed rainfall seemingly improved
    the simulation. Data were also available for the period after senescence. Significantly,
    the ACE software still performed well during this period, notwithstanding the
    dual coloration of leaves. We suggest that ACE has adequate skill to distinguish
    between green and senescent vegetation, which might account for the high agreement
    between measured and simulated values during canopy decline. The ACE software
    fulfills the requirement of high-quality measured data for accurate parameterization
    of AquaCrop noted in other studies (Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2012).
    Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs. measured canopy cover (filled
    circles) and biomass (filled squares) of sweet potato at days after planting (DAP)
    for (a,c) irrigated and (b,d) rainfed treatments at Devon, Manchester, Jamaica,
    in 2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean.
    The accumulation of biomass was well simulated for both treatments, except at
    final harvest, where the model gave an underestimation of 20 to 24% (Table 6).
    The model was slightly more efficient in simulating biomass for irrigated sweet
    potato (E of 0.79 vs. 0.75 for rainfed). The underestimation in the final biomass
    was possibly due to the difference (of 7 d) between the actual harvest date and
    that simulated by the model. It should also be noted that the model assumes that
    there is no further accumulation of biomass once physiological maturity is reached.
    As such, if harvest does not take place on the expected date (and sometimes it
    is not practical to do so), there will be differences between the actual and simulated
    biomass. The identical simulated value for biomass and yields for rainfed and
    irrigated treatments was due to the small amount of irrigated water applied to
    the irrigated plants (equivalent to only 6.8% more total water than for rainfed
    plants). The progression of yield is shown in Fig. 8. Together with the data presented
    in Tables 5 and 6, it is noted that the model was much more proficient at simulating
    rainfed yields (E of 0.90 vs. 0.22 for irrigated). In 2013, water was applied
    according to the evaporative demand of the crop as measured by the moisture probes
    rather than at predetermined intervals by automated irrigation as in 2011/2012.
    The lower yields in the 2013 season compared with those of 2011/2012 are attributed
    to the selective final harvesting (of marketable tubers) in 2012 and the reuse
    of the same plots in the 2013 season. Best practice suggests that, among other
    factors, crop rotation should be done to prevent the bioaccumulation of pests
    (arthropods and pathogens) that have a deleterious effect on yields (Caribbean
    Agricultural Research and Development Institute, 2010). This was, however, not
    possible given the space constraints at Devon. This is also in keeping with the
    practice adopted by farmers due to limitations in land space. Final yields for
    2013 were slightly overestimated by the model, with deviations of 16.5 and 8.7%
    for the irrigated and rainfed treatments, respectively. However, this was a marked
    improvement over the simulations of the previous crop season. The non-selective,
    representative harvesting of tubers and accurate weather data are considered to
    be major contributing factors to this enhancement. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer
    Simulated (line) vs. measured (filled circles) yield of sweet potato at days after
    planting (DAP) for (a) irrigated and (b) rainfed treatments at Devon, Manchester,
    Jamaica, in 2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below
    the mean. From the results for both crop seasons, it is noted that there is often
    correspondence between model simulations of canopy cover with biomass but not
    always with yield. When canopy cover is well simulated, so also is biomass. This
    is expected, given that the model is driven by canopy cover (Raes et al., 2009;
    Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et al., 2012). The lack of correspondence for the
    simulation of yield with those of CC and to a lesser extent biomass suggests the
    need for further investigation, particularly because sweet potato is known to
    have cultivar-dependent incongruence between leaf area (canopy cover) and tuber
    yield (Bourke, 1984; Fielding and Ryder, 1995). The inherent differential growth
    rate of the canopy and tubers throughout the crop season (Caribbean Agricultural
    Research and Development Institute, 2010) and lower correspondence between final
    canopy cover and final yield present unique challenges for deriving mean model
    parameters for sweet potato. There was fair agreement (RMSE = 0.79, E = 0.61)
    in the values of ETo computed by the AWS and that computed by the FAO ETo calculator
    (plot not shown). Notwithstanding, there were occasional deviations in some of
    the daily values measured by the AWS, presumably due to the differences in computation
    method. The seasonal totals were close: 534 mm (AWS) vs. 560 mm (FAO calculator),
    a difference of only 4.6%. The general correspondence is important given that
    many of the production areas in Jamaica do not have automatic weather stations.
    As such, ETo might have to be computed by the FAO ETo calculator, which can give
    reasonable estimates even with limited weather parameters. The simulated WUE values
    (Table 7) for yield of 1.38 (rainfed) and 1.39 (irrigated) kg m−3 are close to
    the upper range for C3 crops like sweet potato (Sadras et al., 2007; Erickson
    et al., 2012). This emphasizes the important role for sweet potato cultivation
    in local and regional food security in light of projections for reduced water
    availability (Taylor et al., 2013). Ebony Park, Clarendon (2013) At Ebony Park,
    the AquaCrop simulation for canopy cover did not agree well with measured values
    for the irrigated crop (RMSE = 17.25, E = 0.29). However, there was a better fit
    for the rainfed plants (RMSE = 16.06, E = 0.67). Actual canopy development followed
    a slightly different pattern from that simulated by the model (Fig. 9). Figure
    9 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs. measured canopy cover (filled circles)
    and biomass (filled squares) of sweet potato at days after planting (DAP) for
    (a,c) irrigated and (b,d) rainfed treatments at Ebony Park, Clarendon, Jamaica,
    in 2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean.
    The model underpredicted growth in both treatments up to 41 DAP, more so for the
    irrigated treatment, and then overpredicted the canopy cover for at least 30 d.
    However, there was better agreement as canopy closure was approached. The divergence
    of measured vs. simulated values in the decline phase was in part due to a heavy
    rainfall episode that occurred on 120 DAP. The added moisture served to stimulate
    further growth in the canopy, so that even at harvest a considerable portion of
    the canopy was still green, i.e., there was limited senescence. There was better
    agreement also between simulated and measured biomass for the rainfed (E = 0.89)
    treatment than for the irrigated (E = 0.39) treatment. The simulated and measured
    rainfed biomass values were nearly identical except at the final harvest (Fig.
    9c), which the model underpredicted by only 7.8%. For the irrigated plants, AquaCrop
    only slightly underestimated the biomass up to 96 DAP but gave a significant underprediction
    of 51.4% for the final measurement. The variance between the measured and simulated
    values at the end of the crop season was affected by the earlier maturity date
    of the model, which differed by 34 d from the actual harvest date. Linear interpolation
    between 32 and 135 DAP (R2 = 0.98) suggested that the actual deviation could be
    lower (–23.8%), with improved values of RMSE (2.75) and E (0.79). The robustness
    of the model in reasonably estimating the biomass up until just before final harvest
    is notable, particularly in light of the poorly simulated canopy cover. Overall,
    the model was efficient at simulating yields for the irrigated (E = 0.64) but
    not rainfed (E = –13.48) treatment (Fig. 10; Table 5). There was good agreement
    with measured yield up to 65 DAP for both rainfed and irrigated sweet potato.
    As the crop developed, differences between modeled and observed values increased,
    resulting in an underestimation of the final yield for irrigated plants of 34%
    and a large overestimation of 182% for rainfed plants (Fig. 8–10; Table 6). The
    underprediction for the irrigated treatment was influenced by the earlier maturity
    date in the model relative to the actual harvest date. The large disparity in
    the final simulated yield for rainfed sweet potato reflects the failure of these
    plants to form tubers. It was noted at harvest that very few tubers had formed
    in any cultivar under rainfed conditions at Ebony Park. Compared with the irrigated
    treatment, rainfed plants received only about half the total amount of water.
    Compared with the crop at Devon in the same season, the adverse effects of 27%
    less rainfall at Ebony Park was compounded by the higher evaporative demand (20%
    higher ETo). Without taking into account evapotranspiration, the recommended minimum
    rainfall is 750 mm for sweet potato production (Caribbean Agricultural Research
    and Development Institute, 2010), about 60% more than that experienced by the
    rainfed crop at Ebony Park. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer Simulated (line) vs.
    measured (filled circles) yield of sweet potato at days after planting (DAP) for
    (a) irrigated and (b) rainfed treatments at Ebony Park, Clarendon, Jamaica, in
    2013. Error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the mean. Harvest
    index in AquaCrop for grain crops is assumed to linearly increase from anthesis
    onward, after a lag phase. This type of yield development does not occur in root
    crops like sweet potato, which has differential growth rates throughout the season
    (Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute, 2010), partly accounting
    for the disagreement between measured and simulated yields. Hsiao and Heng (2011)
    also noted that the model tended to underestimate biomass or yield under the lowest
    water supply (24% irrigation). Due to poor development of tubers in the rainfed
    treatment, it was difficult to accurately assess the skill of the model to simulate
    rainfed production at this location. The WUE at this location was higher (than
    at Devon) for both yield and biomass (Table 7), which further confirmed the crop''s
    ability to successfully adapt its productivity to different environmental conditions.
    CONCLUSIONS Overall, it appears that parameterizing root and tuber crops in AquaCrop
    is more challenging than for other types of crops. Hsiao and Heng (2011) reported
    that potato (of all the crops already parameterized in AquaCrop) has the least
    reliable parameterization. Although significant changes were made to the Irish
    potato parameters in arriving at the current ones used for sweet potato, additional
    work is needed to refine the parameterization and to test other water-limited
    treatments, including deficit irrigation. Further data are needed from additional
    locations and crop seasons than the two used in this study to rigorously test
    the parameters derived. This testing should take into account the interactions
    that can take place between cultivars and their environments, location, and date
    of sowing (Fielding and Ryder, 1995). Additionally, more frequent sampling of
    biomass than could be done in this study would provide more insights into the
    physiological influences on the development of tubers in sweet potato and improve
    performance of the model during the crop life. The dynamics of belowground crops
    like sweet potato need to be further explored, especially the impacts of water
    stress on the harvest index. Other studies (Hsiao et al., 2009; Heng et al., 2009)
    have suggested that AquaCrop does not simulate well under high-water-stress conditions.
    The good agreement between simulated and measured canopy cover (especially for
    the 2013 season at Devon) suggests that the ACE software can be used in the estimation
    of canopy cover from inexpensive digital photographs. The ACE software also appears
    to overcome some of the limitations faced by other techniques like the Green Crop
    Tracker (Liu and Pattey, 2010) that automate CC estimation, particularly as canopy
    closure and senescence are approached. With access to more reliable values of
    CC, existing relationships between CC and leaf area index can be validated or
    refined. Testing of the software on other crops should be undertaken. The results
    presented in this study suggest that the AquaCrop model gives fairly accurate
    prediction of sweet potato yield and biomass under both rainfed and irrigated
    conditions. Canopy cover was reasonably well simulated by the model, but some
    divergence was noted for biomass and yield. The overall simulation of biomass
    was good, with deviations of <28% for four out of six simulations, and season-long
    performance of the model was commendable, with E values of 0.29 to 0.97 for the
    four crops in 2013. The simulation of yield presented more difficult challenges,
    especially given the differential rate of tuber development in sweet potato throughout
    the crop season. The incorporation of sweet potato into AquaCrop adds a second
    belowground crop and the first root crop to its portfolio of crops. While further
    work is needed to refine the parameterization and to test the parameters across
    a wider combination of cultivars, climates, and soils, an important first step
    has been made in encouraging the use of AquaCrop as a tool for the agricultural
    sector in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Global to Local

    demand for food, both in order to ensure quality and quantities, has accelerated
    the need of industrial growth and intensive methods of production in agriculture.
    At the forefront of the new agricultural era, there is an emerging Internet of
    Things (IoT) market that is suggesting several creative solutions. Research organizations
    and scientific associations are seeking to increase their own scope and speed
    by connecting with IoT, contributing technologies and goods to a range of different
    agriculture markets. The IoT idea gained prominence in the year 2000, with the
    development of the Auto-ID at MIT and the subsequent market research reports.
    In IoT, these systems communicate, perceive, and connect with internal & external
    state embedded technologies [1]. IoT is widely seen as the next-generation technologies
    with widespread applicability across almost every facet of the market, with the
    ability to increase the degree of integration of end products, systems, and services.
    IoT technologies are ideal for a number of applications, including healthcare
    services, smart communities, traffic management, agricultural systems, and security
    facilities. ICT(Information and Communication Technologies) being integrated into
    conventional agricultural activities is helping to spark a fourth farming revolution.
    An important facet of technologies such as machine learning, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles), Remote Sensing, Big Data Analytics, etc. is having the capability to
    boost farming activities to new heights. A broad variety of agricultural parameters,
    such as environmental factors, production status, soil condition, irrigation water,
    herbicides and pesticides, weed control, and greenhouse output climate, may be
    tracked in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, and maintain
    process inputs. Smart agriculture and the use of reduced pesticides and fertilizers
    in crops will help to mitigate leaching issues and pollution, as well as the effects
    of climate change, in precision agriculture [2]. Burgeoning IoT technology offers
    many new solutions and further growth opportunities, particularly for novel ideas
    in the agricultural sector. We also benefited greatly from recent developments
    in communication systems and protocols [3], primarily on the lower layers, which
    is the physical, network, and link layer. Besides that, the protocols in the topmost
    layers of the network are critical for effective data exchange and gathering.
    There are many applications, procedures, and designs that can be used in the agricultural
    sector as a whole. There are several ongoing developments in IoT agriculture research
    that involve network engineering and applications, device design, security challenges.
    Furthermore, in several nations and institutions around the world, various IoT
    guidelines and policies have been adopted in agriculture. However, an impressive
    amount of research has been done on IoT and there is still a great need for further
    research on the topic in the agricultural field. This survey paper examines numerous
    challenges and trends related to smart agriculture. 2. IoT-based smart agriculture
    The IoT is reshaping the agriculture sector by providing farmers with a diverse
    set of tools to address several challenges faced by them on the field. Farmers
    can connect to their farm from almost anywhere and at any time using IoT-enabled
    technologies. Sensors and actuators are used to regulate farming processes, while
    wireless sensor networks are being used to monitor the farm. Wireless cameras
    and sensors were used to remotely monitor the farm and collect data in the form
    of videos and pictures. Farmers can also use IoT to keep up with the current conditions
    of their agricultural land using a smart phone from anywhere in the world. IoT-enabled
    technologies have the potential to deplete the crop production cost and increase
    productivity of the land. Some of the key role played by IoT in smart agriculture
    is illustrated via Fig. 1. i. Water management: A major challenge in greenhouses
    is determining the exact amount of water required [4]. To prevent unnecessary
    water use, smart sensors are installed and operated using a variety of IoT techniques.
    Water storage in greenhouses is achieved by the use of automated drip irrigation,
    which is regulated by a soil moisture threshold. Water management may be handled
    effectively via IoT technology by avoiding water waste through the use of various
    kinds of sensors. The sensors are used to monitor the amount of water in the tank,
    and data is saved on the cloud through a mobile application. Farmers may monitor
    the water level using their cell phones. The motor will operate automatically
    as a result of this technology. If the water level drops, the motor automatically
    turns on, and if the water level is high, the motor will shut down. Up to 50%
    of this water is lost in conventional irrigation systems owing to over-watering
    due to inadequacies in traditional irrigation techniques and systems [3]. To address
    this issue, smart irrigation systems powered by IoT assist farmers in avoiding
    water waste and improving crop quality via timely watering. Temperature and soil
    sensors are installed on fields in smart irrigation systems; these sensors communicate
    field information to farmers via a knowledge gateway. Weather-based precision
    agriculture controllers monitor and modify irrigation schedules depending on local
    weather information. ii. Irrigation management: It is in charge of anticipating
    the design, improvement, operation and management of irrigation systems. Tracking
    water requirements of crops based on gathered data and actuating the water flow
    in accordance with the anticipated needs without the participation of human operators
    is one of the objective of irrigation systems. It uses dispersed sensors to monitor
    different soil, water body, plant, and micro-climate factors. The irrigation technique
    (e.g., spray, drip, flooding and nebulizer) has an influence on how to properly
    monitor the water body as well as the actuation mechanism. Weather is one of the
    most significant variables in calculating agricultural water needs. The IoT will
    help to upgrade the new irrigation infrastructure in a more fascinating way. By
    tracking weather and soil conditions, a farmer can refine his irrigation system
    in a variety of ways [5]. Weather prediction data, manage and track the whole
    farm from almost anywhere, Ethernet, and WIFI are all exemplars of how IoT technology
    tracks irrigation systems. Smart irrigation systems driven by the IoT make use
    of field-deployed sensors to monitor soil properties, weather and climatic conditions,
    and agricultural terms for irrigation. iii. Soil management: Soil management entails
    determining various soil parameters such as pH, moisture content, and so on. These
    parameters can be conveniently calculated using IoT sensors. Farmers will then
    take measures such as fertilization, drainage, irrigation, and so on. Soil management
    assists in the discovery of the right plant breed. It also assists in the identification
    of fertilizer needs in the soil. It necessitates a low-latency network for urgent
    intervention. For both enterprises and farmers, soil monitoring has been among
    the most challenging activities in agriculture. There are several environmental
    concerns in soil testing that have an impacts on crop productivity. If these types
    of problems are correctly defined, farming patterns and procedures can be readily
    understood. Soil Humidity, Precipitation, Fertilization, and Temperature are among
    the factors being monitored. The moisture content of soil is monitored using moisture
    and humidity sensors. The findings of a soil testing research survey improve crop
    production and propose fertilization options to farmers [6]. Furthermore, using
    IoT technology to identify polluted soil protects the field from over-fertilization
    and crop degradation. Soil management protects and improves the productivity of
    the soil. Additionally, it lowers input costs, avoids pollution, and increases
    agricultural yields and quality. Prior to planting, the topsoil should be in the
    optimal fitness level for the crop in order to promote fast and effective root
    development. While each farm and crop has unique soil needs, there are a few measures
    that may help promote good soil biology such as: organic fertilization, soil analysis,
    proper tillage, measure for chemical soil protection, etc. iv. Weather management:
    Many relevant factors are combined to preserve and establish an optimal ambience
    for plants while staying under strict limits, such as airflow, temperature, ,
    and levels. This can be achieved by deploying an IoT-enabled ecosystem, in which
    smart sensors and devices exchange data for improved decision-making [7]. Weather
    have the greatest impact on crop production. Farmers can decide the best time
    for planting, irrigation, and harvesting using an IoT-enabled weather forecasting
    system. Probabilistic weather analyses were done using sensors in IoT applications.
    Farmers can learn about environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity,
    and air temperature by embedding remote sensors in the fields. Farmers should
    prepare accordingly and adjust the harvesting and irrigation period to boost the
    crop based on historical results. Farmers should take proactive measures to ensure
    a safe crop harvest by arranging and reviewing collected data. v. Precision farming:
    It is an IoT-based farming technique which primarily entails the analysis of data
    collected in the field in order to determine the most productive crop. Farmers
    gather data using sensors and analyze it for forecasting in precision farming.
    Farmers may use the information collected to schedule their farming operations,
    including what seeds to sow, how much fertilizer to use, when to harvest, and
    also what crop yields to expect. Farmers may also track the farm through sensors
    that detect moisture levels, crop output, and livestock levels with the deployment
    of IoT. The sensors can effectively monitor irrigation machinery from afar. The
    data collected on the land is analyzed by IoT linked devices, making data-driven
    decisions on resource allocation and crop harvesting. The conventional method
    of farming to maximize yield and preserve crops was focused on physical inspection,
    and if there was a problem, it was typically resolved after a severe event involving
    the farm, and it was performed on a trial and error basis. However, in precision
    farming using IoT applications, anything can be pinpoint sooner and behave in
    compliance with the collected data. IoT innovations are assisting farmers in increasing
    agricultural output quantity while maintaining efficiency, productivity, and cost
    effectiveness. Farmers will face a variety of problems, including water shortages
    and floods, a lack of suitable land for crop plantations, and cost control. Farmers
    can reduce possible missteps and increase returns by implementing the IoT infrastructure
    and associated technology. IoT-enabled farming allows farmers to make fast decisions
    depending on the circumstances. The use of IoT in farming would greatly improve
    operational productivity. For example: A precision agricultural practice is one
    that involves assessing a field’s inherent soil variability. When the soil in
    a particular region retains more water, crops may be sown more thickly and irrigation
    can be used sparingly. Alternatively, if the plot is utilized for grazing, it
    may accommodate a greater number of cattle than a comparable area with lower soil
    quality. vi. Nutrient management: Nutrient management entails making the most
    effective use of crop nutrients while also preserving the environment. Nutrient
    management is based on the concept of matching soil nutrient supplies with crop
    needs. Nutrients help in producing optimal crop yields when supplied in the appropriate
    amounts and at the right times; providing too little will restrict output, while
    applying too much will not make practical sense and may damage the environment.
    Nutrients that are not properly used by crops may leak into surface and groundwater
    waters nearby. For example, too much ammonia, phosphorus, or nitrogen may degrade
    water quality. Measuring the concentration of nutrients in the soil allows for
    selection of the best crop for multiple cropping cycles on the same land. Nutrients
    and technologies are critical for achieving sustainable agriculture while minimizing
    environmental and economic costs [8]. vii. Waste management: The Internet of Things
    (IoT) proposes a waste disposal solution. IoT sensors may be used to create intelligent
    trash cans. This could be used to read, store, and transfer waste-related data
    through a network. Governance of waste can be accomplished with the aid of certain
    intelligent and streamlined algorithms [9]. viii. Livestock monitoring: The growth
    of agricultural production to provide adequate food for the world’s population
    is becoming a growing worldwide issue. As a result, the significance of livestock
    management in farmland is essential for the survival. Farmers, on the other hand,
    are trying to maintain their cattle in the context of rising worry over land and
    water supplies. Apart from that, farmers continue to focus on reducing waste and
    lowering total expenses. New technological advances are critical in helping to
    enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural output. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) enters the scene at this point. It allows farmers to improve the health
    of their livestock via remote access and data-driven decisions. Cattle Watch is
    a system for monitoring livestock. This cloud-based technology is often used to
    remotely track the well-being of livestock and aids in the identification of livestock
    locations using communication and energy sensors [10]. This method obviates the
    use of an alert system. If any state goes outside of a predetermined parameter,
    the users are told by call, text, or email. As a result, people can view real-time
    information from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces using their smartphones.
    The IoT livestock tracking scheme entails implanting sensors in animals that collect
    specific details about their body and their well-being. Farmers may monitor the
    position, counting, and other similar details of livestock using wireless IoT
    applications. The real-time data provided by the livestock tracking system allows
    sick animals to be identified and removed from the herd, preventing disease spread.
    For example: Farmers can monitor their livestock’s cardiac output, blood pressure,
    respiration rate, digestion, and perhaps other vital signs around the clock using
    connected sensors. ix. Farm Management System (FMS): Farm management systems centralizes,
    administers, and optimizes a farm’s output and operations. IoT based farm management
    system automates the collection and storage of farm data, manages business expenditure,
    agricultural budgets, monitors and analyses farm operations and consumption. Smart
    farming raises production while lowering environmental effects, but this smart
    farming approach is only feasible with the help of FMS. For smart farming, FMS
    is an important component for production, planning, and decision-making [11].
    Farmers can track the entire farm with an interconnected FMS that uses Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modules [12],
    and a micro-controller to capture all of the data. On all sensors and devices
    throughout the field, an identifier is used to provide proper awareness of fertilization,
    weather details, automated buffer zone width tracking, and automatic information
    record generation based on daily farm activities. This data is saved in a regular
    format on the server and can be accessed for even further processing through a
    mobile phone or the internet. An automatic irrigation and control system [13]
    is used to maximize the usage of water supplies. In addition to the irrigation
    scheme, the farm is secured from pests and animals [14]. x. Tracking and tracing:
    IoT provides agricultural firms with helpful data to help them make better choices,
    such as organizing, handling, and communicating with business associates intelligently
    while saving resources and time. RFID and GPS are used to map the conditions of
    soil, air, water, herbicides and pesticides in a growing environment. Using wireless
    network connectivity, a GPS device is used to pinpoint the precise location of
    an agricultural areas and track different agricultural parameters. In [15], an
    architecture was developed to remotely track soil condition and soil structure
    in accordance with crop culture requirements. Through using WSN, ZigBee is linked
    to other devices such as CMS, GSM, and GPRS to track and acknowledge real-time
    data processing. When unexpected changes arise, GPS provides an interface to communicate
    with ARM (an intelligent control device to accomplish tasks such as SMS/MMS) and
    sends an alert to the farm manager, enabling the farmers to take appropriate action.
    Despite its high operating and maintenance costs, it is commonly used in agriculture
    because of its accurate positioning identification and control capabilities. xi.
    Crop management: Crop management involves assessing and recording the well being
    of a crop. Plant and crop diseases can be detected using IoT sensors and RFID
    chips. These details can be gleaned from RFID tags and shared across the internet
    by the reader. This data are processed remotely by the farmer, and necessary steps
    are taken. This will keep pests away from the crops. In agricultural sector, production
    tracking and prediction have played an important role in delivering benefits to
    users in order to produce valuable output while minimizing losses. [16] suggested
    using SVM to forecast rice production with the aid of a Chinese monitoring station
    for specific knowledge of geography. [17] has demonstrated an efficient automatic
    counting strategy for coffee fruit, which helps farmers schedule their agricultural
    processes and efficiently prevent risk. Neural Networks has been used to forecast
    crop production and analyze pest management in the context of environmental conditions.
    Analogously, the research scientist used an Artificial Neural Network to predict
    the current agricultural yield [18]. Due to the extreme changeover in spatio temporal
    and also its crop yielding task, the K-means approach has been proposed for evaluating
    the extreme computational measure. Crop production is fully estimated under various
    edaphoclimatic types of environmental conditions. The effect of numerous agricultural
    parameters within the spectrum of obtained loss by applying decision tree algorithm
    on grain loss analysis and prediction has been explored [19]. Furthermore, CNN
    [20] was used to recognize and categorize the generated drop based on an illustration
    of a vein leaf containing red, white, and soya bean. xii. Blockchain with IoT
    for agriculture: The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of transactions that
    all parties contribute and maintain. It offers a trustworthy source of information
    about the condition of farms, inventory, and agreements in agriculture, where
    such data gathering is often extremely expensive. Blockchain technology enables
    the tracking of food’s origin, thus facilitating the establishment of trustworthy
    food supply chains and the development of trust amongst suppliers and consumers.
    As a secure data storage medium, it enables the employment of data-driven technology
    to improve agriculture’s intelligence. Additionally, when used in conjunction
    with smart contracts, it enables payments on time to stakeholders that may be
    prompted by blockchain data alterations [21]. Table 1 highlights few recent findings
    and shortcomings of different IoT based frameworks for performing smart agriculture.

    agriculture This section of the paper gives an overview of different IoT sensors
    and sensor networks being used for making the agriculture sector smart. A sensor
    is indeed a device that monitors several parameters, such as pressure, light,
    moisture level, and so on. Most of the time, the sensor output is an electrical
    signal, which is sent to a micro-controller for the further analysis on a network.
    The development of simple to advanced sensors represents a transformation in the
    way we gather information, conduct analysis, and connect diverse structures in
    order to attain new ideas we may never before have conceived of. Fig. 2 illustrates
    the components and basic structure of a sensor node used for performing smart
    agriculture. An intelligent sensor node comprise of three components namely: Sense,
    Compute, and Communicate. The sensing component is responsible for capturing the
    real-world parameters such as moisture, temperature, etc. The computational component
    pre-processes the captured parameter value and the communication component makes
    sure that the gateway sensor nodes are able to communicate with gateway nodes
    and can share the information among them. A variety of sensors are available for
    measuring and calculating the specifications of a farming field. The underlying
    concepts of different sensors, as well as their corresponding requirements, are
    summarized below: Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Components of sensor node. • PH sensors are being used
    to track the precise quantity of nutrition in soil, which is important for the
    stable germination of seeds and crops. The absorption of chemicals or biomolecules,
    as well as the speed or rate of chemical processes, are both affected by pH [29].
    Soil pH is very important because it affects biological & chemical processes.
    For instance, when pH is low, nutrition, growth, and productivity of most crops
    suffer, and when pH is high/optimal, productivity enhances. Many crops thrive
    in soils with a pH of 6 to 7.5, whereas others favor acidic or alkaline soils.
    For example: In soil management, soil pH acts as an important indicator for crop
    production, therefore its geographical variation must be handled to enhance precision
    management choices. • PIR sensor: A motion detector is integrated into the PIR
    (Passive Infrared) sensor, which tracks the direction of an individual’s movements
    in the field. Additionally, the sensor has a light detector feature: when monitoring
    an object, it converts rise in temperature to voltage for the purpose of examining
    crop production [30]. Everyone produces some IR radiation, with some emitting
    modest levels and others emitting high levels depending on just how hot they are.
    Two slots of IR sensitive material are included in a PIR sensor. Both slots detect
    the same amounts of IR if there is no motion in front of them. When anything hot
    pass in front of the slots, such as an animal, the very first slot detects a variation
    in IR level and produces a positive differential between the two slots. As the
    animal moves from the second slot to the first, the impact is reversed, resulting
    in a negative difference between the two positions. The PIR detects these fluctuating
    amounts of IR. • UV sensor monitors the intensity of ultraviolet radiation for
    optimal crop production [31]. For instance, while using Iot components for weather
    management, it is evident to notice that plants respond to a variety of environmental
    factors, including soil nutrients, airborne chemicals, watering frequency, and
    the amount and type of light they receive. UV radiation has also been shown to
    affect the flavor, fragrance, and appearances of food cultivars, as well as increase
    the terpene concentration of cannabis crops. • Weed seeker is a self-confined
    unit that is usually fitted with opto-electronic components for the purpose of
    weed identification and spraying. The unit is composed of an activated source
    of light and a specific spray sensor that detects chlorophyll. By the use of an
    optical system, the device is capable of detecting and spraying mainly weeds throughout
    the field. The service’s systemic application will greatly minimize herbicide
    use. As a consequence, only a small amount of chemical is needed, lowering the
    implementation cost [22]. While performing crop management, weed control using
    IoT in agriculture is a time-consuming and costly process. Precision weed management
    (PWM) is defined as the administration of the appropriate quantity of inputs to
    the correct target (weeds) at the appropriate time. PWM is centered on using information
    technology to make site-specific weed management decisions. The spectroscopic
    reflectance of the leaves may be used to distinguish between various plant species
    [32]. • Wind speed indicates the speed of the wind at the surface. It is often
    important to observe occurrences in a field, such as changes in wind direction.
    These sensors must be installed at an appropriate height based on the location
    of the crop [33]. The input on wind direction is utilized for weather forecasting,
    crop harvesting, insecticide spraying, and other agricultural operations. Wind
    speed is monitored using a cup-type sensor, with the speed related to the number
    of revolutions. A potentiometer is used to detect the direction of the wind. •
    Water content/Soil moisture sensors for measuring water content are used in a
    broad variety of research fields. The proportion of the quantity of water available
    in the test soil to the overall amount of the test soil denotes the soil water
    content. It is quantified by the variation in capacitance value, that is dependent
    on the soil’s dielectric constant [34]. It can vary from completely dry to the
    saturation porosity of the material. Since the measurements vary according to
    the soil condition, the sensor should be tuned at each location. This sensor tests
    soil water suction, which seems to be a substitute for the effort exerted by the
    plant root in absorbing moisture from the ground. It may be used to determine
    the amount of water contained in the soil or the amount of irrigation necessary
    to achieve a desired level of soil water. The sensor determines the amount of
    water and the degree of moisture present in the field. [35] describes the usage
    of a wireless moisture sensor to track the greenhouse irrigation method. Dielectric
    Soil Moisture Sensors [36] measure an electrical characteristic that varies based
    on the quantity of moisture present in the soil to determine moisture levels.
    • Temperature sensor monitors the temperature changes in the soil that have an
    impact on the absorption of nutrients and moisture. A novel sensing technique
    was developed to precisely map the volume of nutrients in the soil and on the
    surface of the water. A 3-dimensional crop sensing element equipped with photosynthetically
    active radiation technology can be deployed in any field area to measure temperature
    [37]. Ambient condition & asset monitoring are two significant aspects of smart
    agriculture that need temperature sensors. Ice wine cultivation, for example,
    is known to take place within a limited temperature window between −10 °C to −12
    °C throughout a harvesting period. The ice wine business requires very precise
    temperature and humidity for efficient output. Temperature sensors are crucial
    in almost all smart agricultural asset monitoring applications. • Gas sensor determines
    the precise concentration of poisonous gases in farmland, livestock and hydroponics
    by monitoring infrared radiations [38] There are a variety of strategies for reducing
    agriculture’s carbon output, but all of them require the ability to calculate
    and consider existing pollution levels, as well as track improvements. This is
    typically accomplished by the usage of gas sensors equipped with various analytical
    capabilities which could be used to monitor and log the quantities of , , or hydrocarbon
    gases. For example: monitoring is essential for the long preservation of grains
    and cereals. Variations in temperature and relative humidity levels in grain storage
    may be detected using gas sensors, which is significant for freshness and edibility.
    • Humidity sensor captures humidity that has a detrimental effect on plant leaf
    growth, and photosynthesis. As a result, this sensor involves measuring the moisture
    and temperature content of the air to indicate the degree of humidity [39]. Grofit
    offers a variety of climate control instruments that measure air temperature,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation. The device’s data transfer range is up
    to 200 m, and it records measurements for a period of 30 days. • Motion detector
    sensor is often used to locate the position of animals and fields; however, it
    detects the motion of an unexpected entity in the farm and sends warnings to the
    farmer, allowing for prompt intervention and crop loss prevention [40]. • GPS
    (Global positioning system) provides the precise positioning of farm, or livestock
    with respect to latitude, longitude and altitude. With respect to farm management
    systems, drones may be used, that can operate in tandem with sensor and GPS. It
    may be commanded remotely or fly autonomously using software-controlled scheduled
    flights in their embedded devices. Crop condition, irrigation, fertilization,
    sowing, plant enumeration, yield prediction, etc. may all be learned from drone
    data. Drones may be purchased and kept near farmland where they will be charged
    and serviced, or they can be scheduled for agricultural surveys (drone as a service).
    Following the surveys, the drones must be transported to neighboring laboratories
    where the gathered data can be analyzed. • Photodiode helps in identifying the
    soil properties such as organic matter and moisture content using light. It can
    be used by ray attenuation for measuring the soil-water content [41]. • Tensiometer
    detects the force used by roots for water absorption. It measures soil compaction
    using probes. Irrigation scheduling uses tensiometers to assist farm owners and
    other irrigation operators in determining when to irrigate. Tensiometers may be
    used in combination with a water retention curve to calculate how much they should
    water. The subtype of IoT sensors being used in agriculture domain is illustrated

    Precise data analysis is important in agriculture towards growing operational
    reliability and productivity. Based on IoT applications requirement, data analytics
    can be categorized into following types: i. Memory-level [42] ii. Massive analytics
    [43] iii. Business Intelligent data analytics [44] iv. Offline analytics [45]
    v. Real-time analytics [43] Memory-level data analytics deals with analyzing the
    data stored in some storage memory statically. Memory analytics contributes to
    the overall performance of a business intelligence system and offers BI users
    with quicker responses than conventional disk-based BI, particularly for requests
    that take a very long time to execute in a massive database. Massive analytics
    is also referred as big-data analytics. It is the delicate procedure of analyzing
    large amounts of data in order to extract information – such as correlations,
    market trends, and consumer preferences – that may assist companies in making
    sound business choices. While both business intelligence and data analytics include
    the use of data to uncover insights that help the company, there is one significant
    distinction to make. Simply stated, business intelligence is concerned with present,
    whereas data analytics is concerned with the future. Real-time analytics is a
    strategy that involves reasoning and statistics on data in order to provide insights
    that may be used to make faster, and more rational decisions. For certain scenarios,
    real-time analytics simply implies that the analyses are performed immediately
    on the arrival of fresh data. Image analysis has been widely used in agriculture
    for a variety of applications, including disease identification in leaves, stems,
    & fruits, fruit quality assessment, weed identification and irrigation. Lately,
    image processing and IoT have been used in agriculture to boost the efficiency
    of crop production. This entails the need for drones to acquire aerial photographs
    on a regular basis, as well as environmental surveillance using IoT devices. Numerous
    data analytics techniques have been explored in depth in [46]. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the involvement of data analytics in performing smart agriculture. This survey
    paper would not address these techniques in detail. We address the significance
    of data analytics in agriculture and how it can be used to assist in protection,
    estimation, storage management, precise application, and decision-making. Estimation:
    The IoT generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed over time to determine
    current environmental conditions. Data analytics may be used to analyze data obtained
    from various forms of network sensors, and use intelligent algorithm to forecast
    environmental trends and have data-driven solutions. Even though IoT data could
    also be used to monitor different facets of a field, including irrigation systems,
    it also can be used to forecast and alert farmers about disease and adverse weather
    events, such as flooding or drought [47]. For example, in forestry, sensors may
    be used to detect fire outbreaks and forecast the area within a forest that is
    at risk of igniting. This knowledge will assist firefighters in implementing preventative
    steps at the precise spot. Another field of forecasting is early alert systems
    for natural hazards in order to enhance emergency response. Download : Download

    in smart agriculture. Protection: Landowners are often subjected to harsh climatic
    conditions, which may result in a substandard yield. Fortunately, farmers can
    insure their crops and livestock with the usage of IoT technologies. A sensor
    network can be configured, and remotely unmanned stations can perform surveillance.
    The data may then be analyzed in the cloud. The insurance scheme will have a notification
    device, in which adverse weather events are forecast and insured farmers are notified
    by text message. This encourages farmers to take preventative steps to safeguard
    their activities. An additional value of data analytics in insurance is that insurance
    providers have access to information from distant farms and may trigger an automatic
    payout through IoT digital payment services in the context of adverse weather
    conditions. This will obviate the need for a prolonged claim procedure in which
    the insurance provider visits the farms to determine the degree of the harm. Storage
    management: Agricultural commodities are often destroyed as a result of insufficient
    warehouse control. Although climate, humidity, and some other external conditions
    significantly influence food product, bugs, microorganisms, etc may affect the
    production of food products [48]. The incorporation of IoT and data analytics
    into storage monitoring systems has the potential to significantly increase agricultural
    commodity storage. Sensors may be used to keep an eye on storage warehouses and
    the surrounding environment. The data is stored and processed in the cloud. To
    change the environmental circumstances, a self-automated decision framework based
    on analyzed data can be used. Additionally, when severe circumstances are encountered
    or a pest is found in the warehouse, an alarm signal may be sent to farmers. In
    India, approximately 35% to 40% of fresh produce is lost following harvest due
    to a variety of reasons, like rancidity or pest. Although the IoT has the ability
    to enhance agricultural storage facilities, protection should be incorporated
    into those networks to deter commodity theft during rolling blackouts. Precise
    application: By using sensor data, it is possible to apply pesticides and fertilizers
    precisely to particular areas of the field, increasing production thus decreasing
    farming costs. Although developed countries have already implemented precision
    agricultural practices on farms, developing countries are starting to adopt the
    tech, particularly on research farmlands [49]. Consequently, the implementation
    expense, technology, and knowledge of IoT-based smart agriculture programs in
    different countries continue to confine their adoption. Additionally, since the
    majority of farms in developed countries are small-scale, most farm workers do
    not see the value in implementing such technologies. Developing suitable precision
    farming systems for smallholder farmers remains a testing and design challenge
    for researchers and designers. Another benefit of data analytics in smart agriculture
    is its use of directing machinery to specific positions inside the farm utilizing
    GPS and position details, thus growing farming productivity as opposed to human-driven
    equipment. This will result in time and fuel savings, as well as cost savings
    on operations. Decision-making: Making decisions involves accurate knowledge,
    which can be gleaned from sensor data. The vast volume of data gathered by sensors
    creates resources for learning to enhance decision making in continuously evolving
    environmental scenarios. These choices may be taken in the immediate, intermediate,
    or long term. When those requirements are fulfilled, the IoT device may make automatic
    decisions, requiring little to no human interference. These automatic decisions
    may vary from temperature regulation to irrigation system management. For example,
    in solar farms, machine learning may assist in determining the optimum condition
    for growing a specific crop by analyzing data from sensors measuring nutrients,
    yield, development, transpiration, brightness, smell, and re-transplantation.
    The amount of knowledge gathered from data analytics will also help administration
    and all stakeholders make better policy decisions; thus, it is critical that the
    data is reliable, succinct, full, and timely. Numerous strategic decision-making
    frameworks have been created to assist farmers in making rational agricultural
    and livestock management decisions [50]. The data analytics makes professional
    recommendations to landowners, manages pests and diseases, and makes recommendations
    derived from remote expertise control systems. Machine Learning technological
    farms: Machine learning (ML) may be seen as a breakthrough mechanism for machines
    to mimic human active learning, acquire new information, continuously boost efficiency,
    and attain unique development. On other side humans (in case of agriculture: Farmers),
    are masters at multi-modal processing and can almost immediately integrate incoming
    inputs into an hypothetical knowledge based on their experience [51]. In recent
    years, machine learning models, concepts, and implementations have been very effective
    when coupled with other agricultural methods to reduce crop expenses and increase
    output. On agricultural fields, machine learning technologies may be used in a
    variety of ways, including disease diagnosis, crop identification, irrigation
    management, soil quality, weed tracking, crop quality assessment, and weather
    prediction. After harvest, machine learning may be used to analyze the freshness
    of products (fruits, vegetables, etc.), lifespan, quality of products, and market
    analysis. The application of machine learning in IoT-enabled agriculture could
    be based on a variety of different machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian
    mixture models, Neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy clustering,
    etc. [52] present an Iot system with a ML algorithm that anticipates climatic
    conditions for fungal detection and mitigation based on temperature, comparative
    air humidity, speed of wind, and rainfall; furthermore, [53] developed a mechanism
    for disease prevention and monitoring on cotton leaves in conjunction with soil
    quality tracking. In certain scenarios, where the machine learning based IoT model
    faces shortage of streamline flow of data, interactive machine learning proves
    to be fruitful. The interactive machine learning algorithms regulates the learning
    factor of the algorithm by involving humans as agents [54]. The farmers can play
    the role of agents in case of agriculture domain. It has also been presented that
    the intelligence of machines can be improvised by involving human(farmers)-in-the-loop
    [55]. 5. Smart agriculture applications, software and hardware In this section,
    we have highlighted few apps, software and hardware which are playing a crucial
    role in making the agriculture system behave smartly. The apps are responsible
    for collecting the data for further analysis. 5.1. Smart agriculture apps Following
    are some of the most widely used IoT apps in smart agriculture: i. Nutrient ROI
    calculator: eKonimics has launched a revised edition of its highly esteemed ROI
    (return on investment) calculator [56] which aims to assist farmers in optimizing
    yields and earnings. The most recent iteration of the calculator integrates spatial
    uncertainty, providing farmers with a more precise representation of predicted
    nutrient response in production-scale agriculture. Farmers are able to create
    more precise fertilizer application strategies as a result, optimizing the gains
    of farm inputs and therefore can enhance their profitability. ii. Sirrus: It enables
    collaboration between agronomists and farmers by rendering field data available
    and simple to obtain [57]. By linking to the agX framework, users and applications
    can access structured field data offline and exchange it with some other users
    and devices. The advanced advice editor in Sirrus Premium enables service providers
    to offer changes in the field or when consulting with a grower. Users may modify
    fertilizer application rates, costs, and overall product prices. Sirrus credits
    prices dynamically depending on recent or flat rate applications. After selecting
    a product, labeling and safety data sheets (SDS) are widely sufficient to ensure
    proper product safety and usage. iii. FieldAgent: It collects data to create stunning
    agricultural crop health charts, count seeds, plants and identify weeds, among
    other things. It is compatible with the majority of modern DJI (Da-Jiang Innovations)
    drones and takes care of all the flying specifics, allowing you to concentrate
    solely on the targeted map. It displays the comprehensive orthomosaics, plant
    species, weed positions, and precise Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    crop-health items directly on your computer, along with position data to facilitate
    in-field scouting [58]. Task forecasts are given at the start of each trip and
    are revised as the task changes. Prior to takeoff, you can view and change almost
    any part of your flight route. Without regard for size, way-point, or acreage
    restrictions, you may fly vast fields simultaneously. When the drone’s batteries
    run out, FieldAgent would drive it home and drop it off where it departed off.
    iv. OpenIoT: It assists plant breeders in determining the state of various varieties
    of wheat by calculating humidity, temperature of air and soil. This enables farmers
    to forecast harvest dates, irrigation schedules, and nutrient requirements for
    plant development [59]. v. Farmbot: It makes use of open-source hardware and software
    for IoT in farming. It is based on developing an open source autonomous smart
    agriculture machine for the sake of mankind [59]. FarmBot assists customers in
    producing and growing their own food, developer Rory Aronson (CEO of Farmbot Inc.)
    said [60]. “It is something more than just understanding the origins of your food.
    Anyone who wishes to participate and assist us in building the future of agriculture
    has the potential to do so through their open-source technology”. vi. SmartFarmNet:
    It responds in near real-time to requests raised on time-series streaming data
    via sensors. It integrates non-SQL (NoSQL) and conceptual storage arrays. This
    arrangement manages (user, sensor, aggregated) data, and data caching. SmartFarmNet
    gathers, extracts, and aggregates data streams [61] from nearly all Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) system. For data ingestion, the SmartFarmNet gateway makes use of the OpenIoT
    X-GSN feature [62]. Wrappers are used to interact with sensors. A wrapper is a
    platform which enables the gateway to retrieve and transmit data from and to an
    underlying IoT system. At the moment, the SmartFarmNet network supports data ingestion
    from over thirty IoT interface platforms. vii. iSOYLscout: iSOYLscout is an intuitive
    field scouting application which s imply labels areas manually or using the built-in
    GPS when on foot or in a vehicle. The application can be used to monitor crop
    production, weed infestations, and any other function you want to track around
    the field. Each logged function instantly estimates the area. Interest points
    are denoted by a text tag such as ’Broad weed’. Additionally, notes and/or a photograph
    may be included with the point. ISOYLscout files are automatically imported to
    mySOYL, allowing for wireless and quick data sharing among field and office [63].
    Using iSOYLscout app, the farmer/user initially defines the region of interest,
    which may be scaled to include a single field, a portion of the farm, or the entire
    farm. For instance, the user may choose this based on the kind of data they want
    to collect, which may range from weed infestations to water-logging. Using GPS
    signal, the app will correctly record the position of these locations. Furthermore,
    the software has a manual sketching feature that could be used to distantly add
    a tag to a known place of interest even when the user is not in the vicinity.
    In any scenario, the app will inform the user of the estimated area and allow
    them to modify it. This is particularly advantageous for planning purposes. For
    instance, if a farmer has to establish a 1.0 hectare area of wild bird seed, the
    application will capture this and assist the farmer in properly establishing and
    recording the exact area. Along with regions of interest, any additional information
    deemed helpful by the farmer may be recorded at a particular location on the property.
    Users may create and modify a list of farm-related points. GPS data may be recorded
    automatically or manually. Free text changes of any length are also available,
    as well as the addition of pictures. viii. AgVault 2.0: It enables users to navigate
    whole fields with ease using an inspire drone [64]. The software enables the user
    to configure the UAV’s height, sensor settings, overlapping, steering angle, and
    survey region. The UAV is launched from the inside of the app, autonomously completes
    the preset path, and returns automatically. AgVault app helps in inspecting different
    areas of the field for analyzing the growth rate of crops, insect infestation,
    etc. ix. AgriSync: It helps farmers and consultants to communicate and collaborate
    on farm service concerns. Farmers may communicate with several advisors from different
    organizations in near real-time via video to send and request assistance. Advisors
    can monitor several customer requests with a console and remote video, which enables
    them to see exactly whatever the farmer experiences in real time. The advisor’s
    company will view open cases, settlement status, and farmer reviews in real time
    from a Web-based customer support dashboard [65]. x. FARMapper: It is a web-based
    application of the next generation that enables users to rapidly and easily create
    farm maps [66]. Your map is safely stored in the cloud and it can be accessed
    through mobile, tablets and desktop devices. You can view the farm project from
    nearly every platform that supports a Web browser. The app parses public land
    statistical data for the Municipality, Range, Segment, and quarter segment upon
    clicking on any point. It adds information to every clicked point and highlights
    the parcel. Using the app’s drawing tools, you can create custom polygons in no
    time. Additionally, the app assists farmers in maintaining information on water
    resources, easements, and cultivation. In FARMapper app., the different fields
    are clubbed in the form of maps which can be accessed anytime. Custom Polygons
    are in the app represents different field locations owned by any individual farmer.
    All the maps are stored in cloud and can be accessed anytime with a single click
    using the app, thus helping the farmer to monitor several plots easily. Fig. 5

    IoT combines robotics, drones, remote sensors, and computer vision with constantly
    improving machine learning and computational software to track crops, survey and
    analyze fields, and provide evidence to farmers for appropriate farm management
    strategies that save time and money. Table 2 discusses some of the well known
    IoT software being used in agriculture domain. Table 2. IoT software used in agriculture.

    it can link to several sensors concurrently. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi comes
    equipped with a 40-pin GPIO connector for connecting external sensors [69]. Zephyr
    Zephyr’s goal is to include all components necessary for the development of resource-constrained
    micro-controller or embedded systems. It is a small RTOS for connected, resource-constrained,
    and embedded devices (with a focus on micro-controllers) that supports various

    dependable notifications, and the vast Ubuntu community at your fingertips, taking
    the developer community’s preferred cloud framework to a broad variety of internet-connected
    objects, connected computers, and automated machines [74]. 5.3. Smart agriculture
    hardware In this section, we highlighted some of the well known IoT hardware being
    used in agriculture domain. The most significant hardware component of IoT could
    be its sensors. Power modules, radio frequency modules, and sensor modules are
    used in these units. Table 3 discusses some of the widely used IoT hardware. Table
    3. IoT hardware used in agriculture. Hardware Description ESP8266 The ESp8266
    [75] is a wifi module that helps in establishing wireless connection between different
    components of IoT-based smart agriculture. RTC module This module helps in setting
    up a real time clock. It enables the module to keep track of precise timings of
    any operation to be performed by the designed IoT system [76] DHT11 The DHT11
    is a widely used sensor for measuring humidity and temperature. The DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor is a widely used component. The sensor is equipped with a
    specialized NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit micro-controller for
    serial data output [77]. Additionally, the sensor is factory tuned, making communication
    with other chipsets easy. The sensor has a precision of ±1 °C and ±1% when measuring
    temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C & humidity between 20% and 90%. Therefore,
    if you need measurements within this range, this hardware might be the best choice
    GSM module It can allow SIM from any GSM network provider and can operate as a
    smartphone with its own specific contact number. The RS-232 protocol can be used
    to link the controller quickly [69]. PIC Micro-controller It is used in defense,
    monitoring devices and domestic appliances. Often included is an EEPROM that is
    being used to permanently store the content [78]. This can be used to store the
    data collected by drones while analyzing the farmland. LM35 The LM35 temperature
    sensor generates an analog O/P voltage equal to the measured temperature. It indicates
    the output voltage in Celsius (C). It is self-calibrating and does not involve
    external tuning circuitry. The LM35 [79] has a sensitivity of 10 mV/degree C.
    If the temperature rises, the output voltage rises as well. 6. Principal advantages
    of IoT in smart agriculture Through remote sensing, smart agricultural systems
    minimize wastage, increase production, and allow management of a wider variety
    of resources. In conventional farming techniques, the farmer was continuously
    out there in the field, checking the farmland condition. However, as farms have
    become bigger, it has become increasingly difficult for farmers to manage everything
    everywhere. This is particularly true in micro-farming, where many distant pieces
    of land could be cultivated for a variety of crops, each of which requires a unique
    set of circumstances and precise control over soil and water. Control systems
    handle sensor input, providing remote monitoring for supplies and decision support,
    as well as automating machinery and equipment to respond to developing problems
    and to assist production. This is not dissimilar to the success criteria for any
    other “smart” marketing strategy; a standardized methodology establishes the better
    utilization of resources enabling production process on the supplier side and
    for satisfying strict demand-side limitations. Thus, in a smart agriculture system,
    it is about controlling agricultural production and, depending on its state, establishing
    the appropriate growth factors – such as moisture, fertilizer, or material content
    – to ensure production of the desired crop. During production, it is all about
    resource management in order to optimize the growth process. Smart and precision
    farming methods, for example, focus on precise sowing using unmanned tractors
    to minimize seed waste and optimize plant spacing to provide the greatest potential
    output per acre. Another example is water usage, which may be improved by using
    precision water delivery techniques such as dripping or subsurface irrigation
    to decrease evaporation and increase soil moisture content by providing water
    only if it is required through sensors and automation. Overall, the whole procedure
    from farm to fork is monitored by sensors and managed by software which reduces
    overall costs, increases overall yield and supply quality, and ultimately improves
    the farmer experience. Following are some of the key benefits of using IoT for
    performing smart agriculture: i. Agility: The improved agility of operations is
    one of the advantages of utilizing IoT in agriculture. Farmers can rapidly react
    to any major change in climate, humidity, quality of air, or the condition of
    soil or crops, thanks to real-time surveillance and forecast systems. Emerging
    IoT technologies aid agricultural experts in saving crops in the face of severe
    weather fluctuations. ii. Clean Process: Precision farming using IoT-based technologies
    not only saves water and energy, making farming more environmental friendly, but
    it also reduces pesticide and fertilizer usage considerably. In comparison to
    conventional farming techniques, this technology provides for a better and more
    organic end result. iii. Automating sowing, irrigation, and harvesting operations
    may help save resources, minimize human error, and lower total costs. iv. Accurately
    monitoring production rates per field over time enables accurate forecasting of
    a farm’s future crop output and value. v. The Internet of Things will aid in the
    advancement of community farming, particularly in remote areas. The IoT can be
    used to encourage services that enable communities to exchange data, knowledge
    and increase contact between landowners and farming expertise [80]. vi. Smart
    agriculture makes extensive use of drones and robotics, which help in a variety
    of ways. This enhancements strengthen the data collection mechanism and facilitate
    wireless surveillance and control. vii. The agricultural sector faces a number
    of challenges, not the least of which is ensuring adequate productivity while
    still ensuring a healthy and nutritious food supply. Numerous allegations of food
    theft have been produced, including adulteration, counterfeiting, and artificial
    manipulation [81]. This kind of fraud is hazardous to one’s health and may have
    a detrimental economic effect [82]. Several of the components of food theft discussed
    in [83] can be resolved by the use of IoT technologies, including product validity,
    procedure integrity, individual truthfulness, and data integrity. The Internet
    of Things can be used to include logistical and analytical regulatory compliance
    for food [84]. viii. One of the alleged benefits of IoT is the opportunity to
    control equipment remotely [85]. The implementation of IoT in agriculture would
    enable significant time and cost savings in inspecting vast fields as contrasted
    to staff personally checking the field by vehicle or foot. Through using IoT to
    determine when and how to apply fertilizers or pesticides, expense and wastage
    may be reduced. ix. The adoption of IoT would enable new business opportunities
    through which independent farmers will escape the manipulation of “middle men”
    and establish direct relationships with customers [86], resulting in increased
    benefit. x. IoT can allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment
    to prevent fraud, expedite component replacement, and ensure routine maintenance
    is performed on time. 7. Key challenges & open research issues We have encountered
    significant technological advancements over the last few decades, and these advancements
    have impacted our daily lives. It is credited with making our lives more convenient
    by putting resources at our fingertips. Among the many innovations in progress,
    IoT, also recognized as M2M, has effectively drawn a large community (in which
    smart sensors gather real-time data and communicate with one another or with the
    internet in order to take appropriate action). IoT as a technology presents both
    prospects and challenges. M2M can be divided into four distinct layers. The first
    component is a sensor that collects real-time data, followed by a communication
    device that handles data transmission. The third computational unit is in charge
    of data analysis, while the service layer is in charge of performing any required
    actions. These four elements are largely carried forward to the Internet of Things.
    The following are the imminent critical issues confronting IoT: i. IoT standardization:
    It is a crucial aspect in developing credibility and establishing a market for
    a novel idea. The introduction of physical objects into the internet creates a
    number of problems in terms of the adaptability of existing internet protocols
    and applications to these objects [87]. In recent years, detailed study has been
    conducted to match current procedures and solutions to these artifacts. The IoT
    includes a diverse variety of heterogeneous devices; if these devices utilize
    disparate standards and protocols, achieving high degree of interoperability is
    challenging. As a result, IoT regulatory agencies such as the IEEE, ETSI could
    prioritize implementing a technical standard to address standardization concerns.
    There are continuing efforts to develop the protocols and specifications necessary
    for millions and millions of IoT devices to communicate with one another. This
    entails interoperability on technological, semantic, conceptual, and organizational
    levels [88]. Interoperability of syntax is synonymous with code formats such as
    XML, JSON, EDI, comma separated variables, etc. as common syntax for data exchange
    [89]. Significant research is expected to be done to promote open standards in
    order to increase interoperability across billions of IoT apps and platforms.
    ii. IoT data: Some of the major issues with data usage in smart agriculture includes
    data reliability, data uniformity, and data volume. (a.) Data uniformity: Agricultural
    data may be lost due to equipment failure or network node breakdown, post-processing
    errors, or pest/disease infestation. Due to the loss of a large number of recorded
    incidents, missing data results in erroneous calculations and degrades the success
    of IoT applications in agriculture. Several researchers have suggested numerous
    imputation approaches over time, including multiple mean matching, kernel smoothing,
    regression technique, and uniform kriging. (b.) Data Reliability: In agriculture,
    the primary cause of missing data is mechanical failure, electricity, weather
    conditions, mislabeled data, and computation error. Numerous implementations of
    data mining techniques [90] exist in smart agriculture, including crop safety
    assistance, irrigation prediction [91], and pesticide reduction [92]. In the other
    side, noisy and abnormal data pose significant impediments to the successful use
    of data mining techniques in smart agriculture. As a result, it is critical to
    manage noisy data using proven techniques [93], (c.) Data Volume: Heterogeneous
    data is another issue with data that arises as a consequence of big data’s existence.
    Agricultural data may be collected using a variety of different technologies,
    including monitors, drones, cameras, and RFID tags. Indeed, since big data is
    heterogeneous, we can employ frameworks that reduce memory requirements and processing
    time correlated with data analysis. iii. Regulatory issues: It is necessary to
    sort out the regulatory and legal structures governing the management and possession
    of farm data between farm workers and data firms [94]. Regulations can vary by
    country in terms of service provision [95] (for example, frequency for wireless
    IoT), technological difficulties, competitiveness, data protection, and security
    [96]. Different laws in different regions of the world can have an effect on how
    IoT is applied in specific applications, such as monitoring and agro-food supply.
    iv. Market issues: Agriculture sector has a very low profit margin, and as such,
    there is a need to coordinate the introduction of IoT-enabling technologies against
    the future benefits. As a result, we address market challenges associated with
    IoT implementation in terms of expense and industry awareness. • Cost: There are
    certain costs associated with IoT implementation in agriculture, which can be
    classified as setup and operating costs [97]. The setup cost covers the expense
    of IoT hardware required for framing a smart environment for agriculture. The
    operating cost is based on a consistent subscription to centralized networks or
    IoT systems that facilitate data processing, maintenance of IoT devices, and knowledge
    exchange, among other aspects. Additional operating costs include those associated
    with data sharing among IoT devices, gateways, and cloud servers, as well as energy
    and maintenance. While certain IoT providers offer free subscription packages
    with restricted features, the amount of linked IoT devices, and the volume of
    information that can be stored is limited. Increased features and facilities result
    in increased payment rates. • Lack of awareness: A significant factor impeding
    IoT adoption in agriculture is a lack of sufficient awareness about IoT and its
    applications, notably among farmers in rural areas. This is a frequent occurrence
    in developed nations, where the bulk of farmers reside in remote areas and are
    often illiterate. If human interference is unavailable, the farmer’s failure to
    use knowledge can be a significant obstacle. v. Security: In smart agriculture
    domain, IoT devices are susceptible to physical tampering, including burglary
    or attacks by rodents and livestock, as well as changes in physical address or
    connection [98]. [99] addressed different security breach cases such as Data Theft,
    SQL Injection attack, etc. at different layers of IoT. Physical components, such
    as sensors and actuators, are the prime focus of the perception layer. Accidental
    or deliberate human activity, malware, or crooks may lead physical equipment to
    malfunction. Consequently, complex and complicated algorithms are challenging
    to incorporate in IoT devices due to their restricted memory, connectivity capacities,
    and low energy usage. Congestion threats, DOS attacks, and routing attacks are
    all possible on the gateway. The protection and positioning of location data and
    IoT-enabled services used in smart agriculture are vulnerable to attacks such
    as system capture [100]. An intruder traps an IoT device and removes cryptographic
    signatures, allowing the attacker unlimited access to the details contained on
    the device’s memory. Such higher-level networking layers may be susceptible to
    denial-of-service (DOS) threats, jamming and man-in-the-middle attacks [101].
    Cloud repositories are susceptible to data tampering and unauthorized resources
    that may disrupt smart farming process [102]. The fast development and widespread
    use of smart mobile technology, and also the combination of IoT with corporate
    digitalization and automation, create new risks and hazards for Information and
    Communication Technologies security on the worldwide market. Potential cyberattacks
    on a variety of different smart agricultural systems may create significant security
    concerns in a dynamic and dispersed cyber–physical context [103]. These risks
    and cyberattacks have the potential to cause significant disruptions to linked
    companies. Additionally, in agriculture’s highly automated environment, smart
    technology and remote administration employed in precision agriculture and smart
    farming are novel to its stakeholders, with the majority of new risks in this
    sector being closely related to comparable concerns in other industries. These
    risks are mostly concerned with cybersecurity, data security, and loss of data
    [104]. Additionally, since the precision agriculture industry makes extensive
    use of heavy equipment that is linked to the internet, there are many new vulnerabilities
    that may have catastrophic effects. Table 4 lists out the different potential
    cyber attacks on smart agriculture. It is important to note that the majority
    of today’s smart agriculture applications are built on IoT technology, which means
    they may directly inherit their security issues. Security features are disabled
    by default in protocols like MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP
    (Constrained Application Protocol), and the operator must enable it as per the
    project’s objectives. [105] demonstrates a system for predicting irrigation needs
    based on climatic and environmental data. The technology predicts soil moisture
    using sensor data and makes irrigation recommendations. A web page is used by
    the end-user to communicate with the system. In the gathering, transmitting, and
    storing stages, the article presents no security measures, authentication checks
    or failure diagnostics. Because of the absence of security, systems are susceptible
    to different types of the attack, indicating that the system is extremely insecure.
    Data corruption or inaccuracy causes predictions to be incorrect and decisions
    to be made incorrectly. Incorrect actions can undermine the growth and diminish
    the system’s acceptance. Likewise, [106] developed a system that uses soil moisture,
    light levels, humidity and temperature sensor to monitor farms. Irrigation can
    be controlled manually or automatically using web or mobile apps. The system description
    is devoid of any security mechanisms, leaving the system vulnerable to the entire
    array of attacks described in Table 4. Controlling actuators with instructions
    from a web application that lacks strong security safeguards provides an ideal
    chance for malevolent adversaries to manipulate the system via malicious scripts
    and illegal access. Similarly, for data sharing between the host, the gateway,
    as well as the nodes, [107] offer a smart agriculture architecture. The article
    presents the system’s architecture but makes no mention of interactivity or remote
    control, and it exhibits no security issues. The most damaging attacks, such as
    DoS, signal interruption, data transit, and routing, are those that target the
    network layer, since it is a data exchange platform. Some of the open issues [108]
    available for researchers include: (Malicious Scripts, Phishing attack, Deny of
    services) at Application layer, (Signature wrapping, Booting Vulnerabilities,
    Forged control of actuators) at Edge layer, (Signal disruptions, Data transit
    attack, DoS, Routing attack) at Network layer, (Autonomous system disruption &
    Hijacking, Fake node, Sleep deprivation, Node capture) at Perception layer. vi.
    Reliability: The Internet of Things devices are intended to be installed outdoors.
    This exposes the devices to extreme environmental factors, which may result in
    sensor deterioration over time and connectivity failures. Physical security of
    installed IoT devices and networks [109] must be maintained to safeguard expensive
    equipment against adverse weather events such as floods and hurricanes. vii. Scalability:
    In smart agriculture, a significant number of connected devices and sensors are
    installed, necessitating the use of an intelligent IoT management framework for
    the detection and control of every node [110]. Gateways and protocols in use today
    would have to accommodate a massive range of IoT devices/nodes, e.g., Sigfox supports
    nodes. viii. Localization: Numerous considerations must be weighed when deploying
    IoT systems. These considerations include the IoT device’s capacity to accept
    position and play capability, i.e., to be installed anywhere and linked to the
    remainder of the globe without requiring any (or minimal) modification or the
    deployment of external hardware, such as gateways. Other considerations include
    the optimal location for the IoT system to have sufficient knowledge and reliability
    without creating disturbance [111]. ix. Networking issue: Smart agriculture presents
    a difficult communication challenge between various sensor nodes [112]. Sensors
    conduct large computations that consume energy, but sensor batteries have a limited
    capacity. As a result, networks need effective energy storage. These problems
    do not occur just at the hardware implementation stage, yet even at its network
    layer. Wireless connectivity [113] is critical for the implementation of smart
    agriculture owing to the uptick expense of wiring. Physical implementation demonstrates
    that the efficiency of approved transceivers is exaggerated by the proximity of
    humans, temperature, moisture, and a variety of other obstacles inside the region
    in which a wireless system or node wishes to interact. As a result, the most effective
    and stable technology can be used to transmit data in view of environmental problems
    and rural environments [114]. A thorough review of the problems and issues associated
    with IoT-based smart agriculture connectivity is offered in [115]. x. Resource
    optimization: Farm owners require a resource optimization process to decide the
    optimal number of gateways, IoT devices, communicated data and cloud storage required
    to achieve an advancement in profitability. This is made more difficult by the
    fact that various farms have varying sizes and need varying types of sensors to
    detect farm variables for certain crops or livestock [116]. This will necessitate
    the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and statistical models capable
    of determining the optimum resource distribution while mitigating costs and optimizing
    agricultural production and income. After setting different prospects for prolonged
    research efforts, most IoT applications in themselves enable to identify difficulties
    for research and development to get a dependable as well as viable solution. The
    roadmap was drawn up by correctly identifying the research goals and objectives
    based on an assessment of the following criteria: (i) Thorough apprehension of
    the Smart-IoT architecture, (ii) Appropriate establishment of constraint free
    communication interface in the network minimizing the cost and maximizing the
    heterogeneity, (iii) Correct recognition and subsequent signal processing of incoming
    data when items are synced via the Internet via communication devices, there is
    a tremendous data generation. Therefore, correct management of collaborative data
    sharing is one of the top-priority, (iv) Standards should be developed to enable
    a broad variety of applications and meet common criteria for all potential IoT
    Smart-agriculture applications. Table 4. Different security concerns and attacks

    of internet devices, steady progress in all domains, from time to time, attracts
    critical concerns, along with updates, that cannot be neglected or disregarded.
    Over the last several years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has made great strides.
    The resources accessible beneath the hood of IoT have run out, and current situations
    have prompted a slew of questions that must be addressed in some manner before
    expanding to newer dimensions. In light of the ever-expanding scope of the IoT,
    several future-related questions have been raised that must be answered before
    we enter a new horizon of performing smart-agriculture. – Would there be any next
    major step in properly identifying and managing the vast array of sensors being
    introduced to setup smart environment for agriculture? – How will the future generation
    of smart-agriculture systems operate in tandem with IoT, especially when technological
    advances is not incessant? – Safeguarding of electrical circuits in IoT system
    against specific environmental conditions such as fire, heavy rain, winds, excessive
    humidity, etc. Different IoT systems for performing smart-agriculture has been
    proposed by several researchers, but crop residue remains a major environmental
    concern. To address this issue [117], we could indeed develop an IoT system infused
    with biotechnology that can assist in gathering data (which would include climate
    factors for growing bacteria and fungi for various sites and croplands) to solve
    the crop residue problem as well as provide a remedy to biodegrade the residue.
    8. Conclusion and future trends IoT has expanded steadily in last few years and
    a variety of IoT-based frameworks have been formulated in a variety of domains,
    most notably in agriculture. This review article discussed the prevailing state
    of the IoT in agriculture by reviewing key works of literature, analyzing current
    IoT research trends, and investigating common IoT sensors, devices, agriculture
    APPs, benefits & challenges, and analytics in IoT-based agricultural production.
    Despite of many challenges, IoT is an innovative breakthrough with a predicted
    exponential rate of growth of 27.1 billion connected components by 2021. Via its
    ubiquitous internet networking, it links diverse gadgets, devices, and individuals.
    The upcoming studies, inventions, and initiatives mostly in field of IoT-based
    smart agriculture would improve the quality of living for farmers and result in
    significant improvements in the agricultural sector. However, a variety of questions
    remain unresolved in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale
    growers. Security and expense are critical considerations. As competitiveness
    in agriculture intensifies and beneficial policies are adopted, it is projected
    that the increasing adoption of IoT for framing a smart agricultural environment
    will increase proportionately. Some of the future trends of smart agriculture
    includes: construction of generic platform for all sort of crops and livestock,
    QoS (Quality of Service), usage of explainable artificial intelligence to monitor
    crop growth and disease control, Policies standardization, other technological
    and deployment advancements. Explainable AI [51] is one of the major necessity
    in most of the domains for understanding the reasons behind any specific decision.
    It fades away the traditional black box concept of machine learning and enables
    the farmers/users in understanding the factors behind the obtained solution. CRediT

    The need to boost farm productivity has become critical as a result of issues
    such that the exponential rise of the world’s population, would need the globe
    to produce 70% more food by 2050, shrinking agricultural areas, and the depletion
    of finite natural resources. The issue has further been aggravated by a lack of
    natural resources such as fresh water and fertile land, as well as declining production
    levels of certain critical crops. Another impediment is the changing organizational
    structure of the agricultural workforce. Furthermore, agricultural labor has declined
    in the majority of countries. Physical labor demand has decreased as a result
    of the shrinking agricultural workforce, prompting the incorporation of Internet
    connectivity solutions into farming techniques. The usage of fertilizer, the number
    of trips made by farm vehicles, and the effective use of resources like water,
    energy, and other resources are just a few examples of how smart farming based
    on IoT helps growers and farmers cut waste and enhance production. IoT smart farming
    systems use sensors to monitor and automate irrigation in agricultural fields
    (light, humidity, temperature, crop health, soil moisture, etc.). Farmers can
    check on the state of their fields from any location. Based on this information,
    they can decide between manual and automatic methods for taking the proper actions.
    In this paper, we will be designing a system to ensure that a farm remains secure
    from unwanted pests and rodents. Cellular networks are a popular choice for connectivity
    because they provide broad coverage for high-speed transmission. However, high-speed
    data is not always required for IoT applications, and cellular-connected devices
    frequently experience battery life issues and coverage gaps. Mesh networks of
    the ZigBee type are commonly used in home automation. This is due to the low to
    medium distance performance it offers. However, when it comes to long distances,
    these fail miserably (a few kilometers). Although Bluetooth/Bluetooth low energy
    (BLE) provides reasonable data speeds, as seen in [1,2,3,4], its range is a major
    drawback. The range provided is simply insufficient for long-distance IoT applications.
    Devices with Wi-Fi capabilities have a limited lifespan and rely on close proximity
    to the Wi-Fi access point to function properly. This is because the frequency
    of the wireless signals used by Wi-Fi technology can be obstructed by physical
    barriers, limiting their ability to easily penetrate through obstacles. The primary
    objective of the system designed in this study paper is to protect agricultural
    fields from rodents, pests, and other intruders. For this system, the use of LoRa
    technology is most beneficial due its low cost and low power consumption. Moreover,
    it can support communication over a long range which makes it ideal for use in
    larger agricultural fields. The major contribution in this paper is about the
    range achieved successfully between the LoRa node and LoRa gateway using the SX1276
    module and the rodent detection system created using an ultrasonic sensor. The
    paper is arranged as below. Sections 2 and 3 include the related works and the
    LoRa technology in detail. The implementation details and experimental results
    are a part of Sects. 4, 5 and 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related Works Literature
    studies show the prevalent use of technology for monitoring and boosting agricultural
    produce. The system designed in [5] utilizes a Heltec ESP32 module, which can
    communicate through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LoRa. The Semtech SX1276 LoRa module
    is considered for the proposed system model, since this farm monitoring system
    requires a LoRa module capable of communicating in the 865–867 MHz band of frequencies.
    The authors of [7] and [8] presented an IoT-based agricultural device that is
    a portable handheld device to determine the state of the environment and soil.
    These gadgets include an EC sensor, a pH sensor, a temperature sensor, a color
    sensor, and humidity sensors, and GPS and ZigBee modules for radio transmission.
    The authors of [11] create portable nodes using SX1278 based on STM32 microcontroller.
    Research indicates that in a densely populated metropolitan environment, a maximum
    distance of 900 m can be traversed. In this paper, the work done demonstrates
    a coverage over 1 km range in urban environment using Arduino and SX1276, however
    [11] makes use of SX1278. The suggested technique in [12] uses a LoRaWAN-based
    architecture to collect, store, and assess a variety of metrics relevant to the
    health of each head of the herd and the habitat where cattle are kept. These metrics
    are characteristic of the bovine livestock scenario. This application keeps a
    check on intruders which could be an added security for the cattle. [13, 14] make
    use of LoRa technology to communicate data between sensors placed in the field
    and a central controller. The sensors gather information on soil moisture levels,
    temperature, and other relevant factors, and send this data to the central controller.
    The central controller then processes this information and provides relevant information
    and recommendations to farmers, such as when to water or fertilize their crops.
    3 LoRa Technology Semtech developed LoRa technology, a new wireless protocol designed
    specifically for long range, and low-power communications. Long range radio, or
    LoRa, is primarily intended for machine to machine (M2M) communication and IoT
    networks. This technology allows multiple apps running on the same network to
    connect via public or multi-tenant networks. The LoRa Alliance has standardized
    low-power wide area networks (LPWAN) for the IoT. This collaboration is critical
    for enabling interoperability among various national networks. A single LoRa gateway
    can manage up to millions of nodes. Building a network is quicker and less expensive
    since signals may traverse large distances with less infrastructure. Moreover,
    LoRa includes an adjustable data rate algorithm that increases network capacity
    and node battery life. The LoRa protocol has several layers for secure communication,
    including encryption at the network, application, and device levels. Figure 1
    shows the range and bandwidth comparison of various existing communication technologies
    such as Wi-Fi, BLE, cellular, and LoRa technology. Fig. 1 Comparison of wireless
    communication technologies [15] Full size image 4 Implementation Details In this
    research paper, the system is designed to monitor the perimeter of a field in
    real time with the help of an ultrasonic sensor for detection of rodent intrusion.
    Once the perimeter is breached, the sensor will raise a flag by sending data to
    the gateway via LoRa communication. The data from the ultrasonic sensor is sent
    to the LoRa module node which is then sent to the LoRa gateway, the gateway then
    sends it to the cloud database through the Wi-Fi module, from which the data can
    be received and read. The communication established here is bidirectional in nature,
    i.e., both the nodes as well as the gateway can send as well as receive information.
    The interfacing is achieved by the help of Arduino UNO board. In Fig. 2, the LoRa
    gateway is connected to a Wi-Fi module that enables it to connect to a cloud service,
    which is considered as a future implementation. Fig. 2 Block diagram of LoRa-based
    farm monitoring system Full size image The SX1276 module''s sensitivity of 148
    dBm, dynamic range of 127 dB, frequency range of 867 MHz, constant radio frequency
    output of + 20 dBm, bit rate of 300 kBits/sec, maximum link budget of 168 dB,
    and packet engine of 256 bytes have all been taken into consideration [16]. The
    LoRa long range modem, which has been integrated into the SX1276 transceivers,
    offers ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and strong interference
    immunity while consuming the least amount of current. The SX1276/77/78/79 can
    reach a sensitivity of over −148dBm using a low-cost crystal and bill of materials
    by employing Semtech’s unique LoRa modulation technology. It is ideal for any
    application needing range or resilience because of its high sensitivity and integrated + 20
    dBm power amplifier, which together produce an industry leading link budget. To
    integrate the SX1276 LoRa module with the Arduino UNO, a breakout board is designed
    over which the module can be mounted. As displayed in the PCB layout in Fig. 3,
    we have an SX1276 LoRa module which is connected to an SMA connector so as to
    attach the antenna. The different pins are connected to pin headers so that it
    could be mounted on a breadboard. The dimensions of the PCB layout as seen above
    is 48.5 × 41.1 mm. The pin headers are kept at a distance such that the PCB could
    be mounted on a breadboard. Fig. 3 PCB design of LoRa module Full size image A
    rubber duck antenna with a frequency of 865–868 MHz and 1 dBi gain is used to
    extend the range of wireless network coverage in a single direction. It gives
    an approximate range of 1000 m (1 km) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Prototype of LoRa module
    Full size image 5 Results In this experimental setup, intrusion detection has
    been tested along with the corresponding range of communication and its corresponding
    signal strength. In Fig. 5, the LoRa node that is attached to the fence or boundary
    will continuously monitor whether there are any intruders approaching the fence.
    Fig. 5 LoRa node transmitted data Full size image Figure 6 shows the LoRa gateway
    messages that are received from the node. These readings give the distance of
    the intruder from the fence along with received signal strength indication (RSSI).
    Fig. 6 LoRa gateway received data Full size image As seen in Table 1, the system
    has been tested over a range of 100 m–1km. The LoRa node module and LoRa gateway
    are first kept at a distance of 100m from each other to test the message quality.
    The message is received without any garbage values. These values are tested in
    a heavily populated area and not in an open field. The distance is gradually increased
    by 100 m and the message quality is tested at every instance. Till the 500 m mark,
    the message quality is the best and after 500 m, there are some garbage values
    transmitted. Since it is tested in a heavily populated area and the ideal setting
    for such a system would be an open field, these few values are acceptable. After
    the 1 km mark, there are no values being received by the gateway. The program
    includes a condition that would make sure that a message will only be sent if
    the distance recorded by the ultrasonic sensor is less than a range of 24 inches.
    The data could also be uploaded to cloud services as suggested in [1, 6]. Table

    6 Conclusion Recent government policies promote farmers to adopt various technologies
    so as to increase their production yield, this in turn is causing a paradigm shift
    in agriculture. In this research paper, a farmland monitoring system is proposed
    and studied wherein, an ultrasonic sensor is used to detect stray animals or rodents
    that attempt to enter agricultural fields, and this information is then relayed
    to the gateway using LoRa communication. Internode communication is disabled so
    as to reduce any interference. The received data could then be sent to the cloud
    and stored in a database as mentioned earlier. Hardware used is LoRa SX1276 modules,
    Arduino Uno, and ultrasonic sensors and the maximum range of communication achieved
    is observed to be 1 km. A future prospect is to connect to a cloud database and
    collect data on the occurrence of rodents and finding the problem areas by increasing
    the number of nodes in the network so as to cover wider areas. As another future
    prospect, the proposed system could also be integrated with security cameras to
    increase surveillance. The use of an ultrasonic sensor in this device serves as
    an economic option and also helps detect intruders that cannot be detected by
    cameras such as insects and smaller rodents. The use of a PIR sensor could also
    be considered to detect movement. References Dharshan Y, Sharmila B, Srinivasan

    Article 21 April 2021 Smart Agricultural Solutions Through Machine Learning Chapter
    © 2023 1 Introduction Artificial Intelligence is our chance to save the future
    of how we tend to our global food supply. Currently, the use of major herbicides,
    pesticides and fungicides are restricted or even forbidden in parts of the world,
    and for the past couple of years, this trend has grown in popularity [2]. While
    this at first glance is great for the environment, it has drastic consequences
    for farmers that now need an alternative to protect their crop and yield. With
    the world demand for food rising continually, it gets increasingly difficult to
    find manual labor to replace any already unpopular chemical-based treatment methods.
    Theoretically, precise spraying technology can tremendously reduce the use of
    chemicals and automated mechanical weed control can replace any missing manual
    labor. What keeps farmers from resorting to a technological solution is its unavailability:
    Currently available detection and application devices are very limited in the
    different types of weeds and plants they can recognize, have mediocre performance
    (as a trade-off for high detection speeds) or do not scale into high precision
    use cases due to cheap sensor and lighting techniques. Additionally, their precision
    and the granularity of their detections are often not suitable for effective crop
    protection and sufficient reduction of chemical use. To overcome this unavailability,
    Deepfield Robotics (a division in the Bosch Group) presents their approach to
    apply modern AI methodology in real world field tasks that alleviate the two major
    issues coming up in crop protection: Replacing manual labor due to missing work
    force, and greatly reducing the use of chemicals. To enable the effective use
    of AI, and more specifically of Deep Learning methods, Deepfield Robotics gathered
    a tremendous amount of training data for plant classification. This makes their
    algorithms able to act as the workhorse for a task currently only human labor
    can solve efficiently and effectively: Recognizing plants in multiple growing
    stages, making automated selective field treatment possible. A precursor technology
    to their current approach is the Bosch BoniRob robot [6]. This article documents
    the learnings from past studies and prototype developments, and the resulting
    Deepfield plant classification system addressing the above points. Different applications
    enabled by this classification are discussed, learnings from past developments
    are presented, and a perspective for future developments and promising use cases
    is given. 2 Plant Classification via Semantic Segmentation To make fine-grained
    decisions about plant treatment on diverse fields, Deepfield Robotics developed
    a Deep Learning based framework for semantic segmentation of plants on fields.
    As its input this method requires well-defined camera images of the field ground.
    These images contain color (RGB) channels and an additional near infrared (NIR)
    channel (similar to the images presented by [5]) to make use of the high reflectance
    of organic material in the non-visual infrared range. For each image, all pixels
    (based on larger super pixel patches) are either classified as part of a specific
    crop or weed and are marked as desirable and undesirable plant species for the
    current, particular field and application. A fusion mechanism stitches all image
    patches together using a precise localization system to a larger image, representing
    the entire field plot. Figure 1 depicts such a fusion result. Crops are blue while
    weeds are red. Depending on the treatment strategy applied, one sort is treated
    and the other one is spared. In the case of weed management, a weeding tool might
    target the red weeds but keep its distance from the blue crops. Fig. 1 Long patch
    of sugar beet plants classified as sugar beet crops (blue) and different weeds
    (red) Full size image Whether a particular plant is considered a crop or a weed
    strongly depends on the current situation. This is accounted for using different
    expert classifiers that specialize on specific crops. Amaranth for example can
    be a cultivated plant, but when found within sugar beet fields it is considered
    an undesirable weed. The same applies to different soil types: Should the color
    or texture of a given field’s soil type strongly differ from other regions although
    the same plants are present, the classification results are prone to degradation.
    Specialized classifiers, at the cost of additional labeled datasets of the new
    soil type and subsequent training effort, can help solve this issue. Generating
    Deep Learning based classifiers capable of identifying crops and weeds to a degree
    applicable for effective ground treatment requires large amounts of diverse, properly
    labeled training data. Over the last couple of years, Deepfield Robotics amassed
    more than 4.3 million pixel-wise labeled images with more than 40 crop and weed
    classes captured in various growing stages, light conditions, weather situations,
    and on different soil types. This data basis combined with a very careful Deep
    Learning neural network design and a heavy-duty training hardware infrastructure
    enables the current system to distinguish crops from weeds in real world situations
    with an average precision of about 93% (area under precision-recall curve) and
    a total accuracy of 98.4% (98.4% correct classification rate per pixel). The respective
    curves are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Classification Quality of Deepfield Deep Learning
    based Plant Classifiers Full size image 2.1 Deep Learning Network Architecture
    As already denoted in [3], the variations in plant size (and thus growing stages)
    to consider complicate the topic of building a uniform network for plant classification.
    In addition to that, generalization to various fields and illumination conditions
    are the main challenges. To account for these challenges, Deepfield Robotics has
    trained networks with different network architectures that work together in an
    ensemble: ResNeXt [7] and DenseNet [8] backbones are combined with either an FCN
    [9] or a U-NET [10, 11] fashion for semantic segmentation. 2.2 A Challenge in
    Larger Crops: Stem Detection For proper treatment of larger plants with a wide
    canopy, knowledge of their approximate stem position helps in both, avoiding hurting
    desired plants and effectively removing undesired ones. As [4] put it, “The stem
    positions are a prerequisite in selective, high precision treatments [...]”. To
    this end, we strive to incorporate a Deep Learning based approach that specializes
    in reliably detecting plants stems. The intrinsic structure of plant leafs can
    hint at the approximate stem position of a plant. A Deep Learning based approach
    can exploit this structure to give a prior on where the actual stem might reside.
    This requires manual guessing and labeling of the actual stem positions in a training
    dataset used for creating a suitable classifier but would result in a stable classification
    mechanism that predicts the approximate stem center. Since this method is more
    prone to inaccuracy caused by errors in the training data and due to differently
    sized stem diameters, a larger treatment safety distance must be considered to
    not unintentionally hurt a crop plant’s stem. A much easier, but also much cruder
    approach would be to guess the stem position based on the plant’s visual center
    of mass. Since a plant’s leafs are not necessarily uniformly distributed, this
    approach yields highly uncertain results requiring a rather large safety radius
    around the guessed stem position, rendering the overall approach ineffective.
    Stem detection is especially important for mechanical weeding applications in
    which weeds must be removed that grow very closely to crop plants. In herbicide
    applications, farmers carefully select the herbicides applied to ensure that the
    cultivated crop is unaffected. The gain in herbicide spotting applications is
    hence neglectable. 3 Treatment Methods Based on Classification Results Protecting
    crops especially in early growth stages requires effective methods for suppressing
    weeds close to the crop. There are two dominant, traditional methods for selective
    plant treatments in agriculture: Weed control by manual hoeing, and spraying chemical
    herbicides. The former is essential for organic farmers, as they are required
    to grow plants completely free of chemical weed control substances. Both methods
    require new perspectives: Manual labor is increasingly difficult to find and gets
    more expensive, while more and more herbicide agents are either restricted or
    outright forbidden [2]. In addition to that, the broad acre spraying practice
    of the past lead to multi-resistant weeds and affected areas are no longer arable
    due to missing proper weed control options [1]. Fig. 3 Mechanical Weeding Tool
    Prototype Full size image AI supported methods alleviate part of both problems:
    Automated systems can eliminate or reduce the need for human labor, and offer
    precise spot spraying techniques rather than spraying entire fields with control
    substances. In terms of mechanical weeding, Fig. 3 shows a mechanical weeding
    tool that allows automated machinery to remove unwanted plants from the field.
    Fig. 4 Classification results after fusion (crops are blue, weeds are red) Full
    size image Fig. 5 Two generated paths (green) based on classification results
    Full size image Figures 4 and 5 show one example of how an automated system can
    assess the required weeding effort on a given field, helping to reduce the need
    for human labor. In Fig. 4, a patch of field is classified and stitched together
    (weeds to remove are shown in red; crops to protect are shown in blue). A path-planning
    algorithm subsequently generates a traveling path for a tool as shown in Fig.
    3. The resulting path and affected ground regions are shown in Fig. 5. Here, two
    weeding tools were operated in parallel to increase the overall machine’s efficiency;
    hence, two travelling paths were generated. The bright green lines are the weeding
    tools’ center points; the transparent green area is the affected area. The path
    planner applied in this scenario can be adjusted for a certain “aggressiveness”.
    The more aggressive the planner is the more reward it gains when removing weeds
    even close to crops. In its conservative setting, the planner always keeps a minimum
    distance from any crop detected. Several parameters of the physical weeding tool
    affect the parametrization of the planner: Maximum movement speed, acceleration
    and jerk, and the tool’s area of effect, but also the movement speed of the tool’s
    host machine—a robot or a tractor implement. This approach operates on a moving
    window—the planned path results from a classification sensor (a camera in this
    case) and is executed by a tractor implement tool further back on the same machine,
    only requiring one field treatment. 4 Platform Development The current system
    design as described above is the result of a multi-tier study. In total, four
    robot platforms were evaluated of which the first three are depicted in Fig. 6
    and the latest design is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 6 Past robot designs developed
    by Deepfield Robotics Full size image Fig. 7 Newest robot design, able to perform
    autonomous weeding Full size image The above robot platforms are reference architectures
    that carry the initially described plant classification and actuator control module.
    The newest design shown in Fig. 7 is an autonomous platform that can perform weed
    control including all steps from online-classification, fusion of the results,
    actuator path planning, down to the mechanical treatment. Besides that, the robot
    is also capable of recording new image data for training the plant classifiers.
    The availability of this kind of autonomous robot class relieves part of the manual
    labor required for weed management, and shifts some of the effort into manual
    image labeling, classifier development and mechanical engineering. 5 Outlook Based
    on the insights gained through the above robot platforms and algorithm refinement,
    the system developed by Deepfield Robotics is now in a stage mature enough for
    addressing more diverse use cases. Besides mechanical weeding and spot spraying,
    additional tasks include targeted fertilization, nano irrigation, and automated
    phenotyping connected to downstream data businesses. An active, secure internet
    connection allows Deepfield’s robots to communicate with the data backbone in
    a centralized data center and archive recorded data, as well as receive new parametrizations
    during deployment on the field. The same is true for the tractor implement modules
    originating from the robot reference architecture: Batches of modules in a tractor
    implement can store diagnostics data on remote servers, receive new versions of
    classifiers, and even store recorded image data for offline classifier improvement.
    6 Conclusion The presented development results justify AI as a prominent candidate
    for supporting crop protection tasks, which is a major challenge faced by farmers
    in the near and long term future. Deep Learning has found many applications in
    industrial automation, the entertainment industry, and many security related fields.
    Successfully applying AI and Deep Learning to agricultural plant classification
    and the diverse characteristics found on agricultural fields is a huge feat, but
    can greatly ease farming at large. References Union of concerned scientists. The

    1. Introduction By 2050, the world''s population will have increased to 9.15 billion
    from the current level of 7.79 billion; the population of South Asia will form
    a large percentage (24.5%) of the global population, with the population of India
    accounting for 17.9% of the total (Table 1). Cereals are an important part of
    the human diet, and hence the annual production of these will need to increase
    by 3 billion tons from 2.1 billion tons today (Diouf, 2009). Wheat, maize, rice
    and, to some extent, millet and sorghum are major food items crucial to the survival
    of billions of people around the world. The South Asian region is one of the world''s
    key breadbaskets, producing almost 20% and 31% of global wheat and rice, respectively;
    these are the main staples of the diet of the majority of the population. The
    International Food Policy Research Institute''s report (IFPRI, 2019) indicates
    that the total cereal production in the world and in South Asia will have increased
    by 50.1% and 62.7%, respectively, by 2050 from the 2010 level under the no-climate-change
    scenario. Whereas, under the climate-change scenario, it will have increased only
    by 38.7% and 48.4% in the world and in South Asia, respectively, indicating the
    serious implications of the effects of climate change for cereal production and
    food security (Table 2). Water availability is related to nearly all the socioeconomic
    and environmental impacts of climate and population changes and their implications
    for sustainability (Elliott et al., 2014). The imbalance between water availability
    and water demand leads to water scarcity, which is one of the most urgent issues
    in the world (Sun et al., 2018). Moreover, global water demand is projected to
    increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, from 3500 to 5425 km3. Evidence has shown
    that climate change will have an adverse impact on world water resources and food
    production, with a high degree of regional variability and scarcity (Lacombe et
    al., 2019). Meeting this projected need in South Asia is doubly challenging considering
    that 94% of the land suitable for farming is already under production, and that
    58% of agricultural areas face multiple climatic hazards such as water shortage
    and extreme heat stress (Amarnath et al., 2017). Sustainably increasing agricultural
    production to meet the growing demand for food, especially with a growing scarcity
    of water, is a major challenge under the changing climate. South Asia is home
    to nearly 25% of the global population, but contains only about 4.6% of the global
    annual renewable water resources, which are very unevenly distributed between
    countries and river basins (FAO, 2016; Lacombe et al., 2019). Except for Bhutan
    and Nepal, per capita water availability is below the world average and continues
    to decline as populations increase. More than 90% of all water extracted in South
    Asia is used by the agriculture sector, compared with 70% globally. Sixty percent
    (60%) of agricultural water use in South Asia relies on surface water and 40%
    on groundwater. Water is the most critical input for agricultural production systems
    in general, and cereal crops are major consumers of water in the region''s agriculture
    sector. Therefore, appropriate strategies and modern tools and technologies for
    cereal production, especially those aimed at producing more with less water and
    still minimizing the impact of environmental externalities due to projected climate
    change, will be crucial for future food security on a sustainable basis. Table

    Washington, DC, pp. 1–157. The average water availability in South Asia is low
    (1137 m3/person/year), but varies widely, however, between different South Asian
    countries (Lacombe et al., 2019), with the lowest availability in Pakistan (1306)
    and India (1458), the two major cereal-producing countries of the region (Table
    3). India, South Asia''s largest geographical area, with over 72% of the region''s
    population, covers 2.4% of the world''s total geographical area and has 18% of
    the world''s population, but only 4% of its fresh water resources. Annual water
    availability in India was about 3000 cubic meters (m3) per capita in 1951, which
    has declined to the current level of 1458 m3 per capita due to increased population
    and increased water use in other sectors of the economy. As per the Falkenmark
    Index, a commonly used indicator of water scarcity, a country with renewable water
    availability below 1700 m3 per capita per annum is categorized as water stressed,
    although this index cannot be directly applied to the South Asian region due to
    variations in lifestyle and water usage as compared to developed nations. However,
    a region with a per capita total renewable water availability of 1137 m3/year
    is by and large a water-stressed region, and the declining per capita availability
    calls for greater restraint in water-use management. Table 3. Water resources

    The major issues related to the variability in available water resources in the
    region are (a) large temporal variability, leading to disasters such as floods
    and droughts; (b) high regional mismatch between availability and rapidly increasing
    demand for water for various uses, while availability remains nearly the same;
    and (c) increasing and unsustainable use of both surface and groundwater resources
    to meet the growing demand. High temporal variability in South Asia is largely
    due to the monsoon climate where about 70% of the annual rainfall takes place
    in a limited span of 4 months, i.e., from June to October. Consequently, in this
    period, the rivers carry about 70%–75% of their annual flow, at times much beyond
    their capacity to safely carry such volumes of water. During the remaining 8-month
    period, river flows account for the residual 25%–30% and many rivers run dry during
    summer months. Groundwater levels also follow a somewhat similar pattern of rise
    and fall, but with some time-lag. Large variability in water availability gives
    rise to a host of problems, including floods and droughts. In addition, there
    are large spatial variations in water availability that lead to scarcity in some
    regions and surpluses in some river basins, normally occurring at the same time.
    Agricultural water use as a percentage of the total water use in South Asian countries
    varies from 90% to 98% with a very high regional average of 91% (Table 3), and
    hence needs high attention and greater efforts in developing and deploying precision
    water management technologies and practices, in order to reduce the volume of
    water used by agriculture by improving water use efficiency. 2. Water in agriculture:
    Present and future scenarios Water is a crucial input in any agricultural production
    system, and plays a role not only as a key constituent of plant food synthesis
    and translocation, but also in reducing stress and vulnerability to climatic risks.
    Across South Asian countries, irrigated agriculture accounts for the major share
    of food grain production. In India, which has the region''s largest population,
    irrigated agriculture accounts for 55% of the total food production, but contributes
    about 74% of the production of major cereals (wheat and paddy rice) of the country
    and is the fulcrum of its food security. Since the area under cultivation has
    already reached saturation point and there are no further opportunities for area
    expansion, the growing food demand has to be met through productivity gains for
    future food security. Since a large proportion (54%) of agricultural land depends
    on rainfed farming (Dhawan, 2017), which under the growing complexities of climate
    change is highly variable, large productivity gains in these areas cannot be expected.
    Therefore, irrigated farming (both surface and groundwater) has to play a major
    role for future production gains in the region through increased cropping intensity
    as well as yield enhancement. An increase in cropping intensity in irrigated areas
    will provide an opportunity to improve the production of agricultural commodities,
    but will require an increased input of irrigation water. 2.1. Current situation
    and challenges Cereal-based systems in general, and rice-wheat (13.5 m ha) and
    rice-rice (10.0 m ha) systems in particular, form the basis for food security
    in South Asia (Jat et al., 2014; Ladha et al., 2009). Rice, a water-guzzling cereal
    crop, is grown on about 42 m ha in different rice-based cropping systems in India
    and consumes a major share of irrigation water. Moreover, due to the irrational
    use of irrigation water and non-scientific use of land, plans that do not consider
    the capability of the land have created a large gap of about 22 m ha between gross
    irrigation potential created (118 m ha) and utilized (96 m ha) in India. This
    gap can potentially be bridged to a large extent by improved irrigation efficiency
    and water productivity using innovative cropping systems and precision water-management
    practices. At the current level of utilized irrigation potential of 96 m ha, India
    uses approximately 650 billion cubic meters (BCM) of irrigation water, giving
    a delta of about 68 cm ha− 1 of gross irrigated area (GIA). Considering 70% of
    the average rainfall of 1170 mm as effective for meeting the demand for water
    for crops, gross irrigation water use works out as 148 cm ha− 1 of GIA, which
    is quite high in comparison to irrigation water use in developed countries (about
    90 cm ha− 1 in the United States) and hence there is high potential for bringing
    more area under irrigation through innovative technologies and production systems.
    The development of groundwater has made a significant contribution to an increase
    in irrigated area, about 63% of which is dependent on groundwater for irrigation.
    Highly subsidized or free power for pumping in many states is being provided to
    incentivize the use of groundwater for irrigation, but it has also encouraged
    users to overexploit deeper aquifers, resulting in depletion of the water table
    and deterioration of water quality in many areas. The latest assessment carried
    out by the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) of India indicates the state of groundwater
    and reveals that of 6584 Development Blocks in the country, 1034 are over-exploited,
    253 are critical and 681 are semi-critical, while 96 are saline. Water logging
    is another challenge that has emerged due both to poor drainage of irrigated soils
    and to over-use of irrigation water in canal commands. Moreover, the projected
    impacts of climate change (rise in temperature, and variability in rainfall due
    especially to a reduction in the number of rainy days and increasing intensity
    of rain) have significant negative consequences on the availability of water for
    agriculture (Jat et al., 2016; Kaur et al., 2013; Narjary et al., 2014; Yadvinder-Singh
    et al., 2014). South Asia in general and India in particular are more vulnerable
    to climate change due to a significantly high pressure on natural resources and
    their overexploitation because of a high density of population, the majority of
    which is dependent on agriculture. Estimates indicate that over 50% of urban India''s
    sewage that enters water bodies is untreated and hence pollutes the groundwater.
    2.2. Future trends in water use Projections (Fischer et al., 2007) indicate that
    developing and developed regions of the world will have an increased irrigation
    water (IW) requirement of 50% and 16%, respectively, between 2000 and 2080. At
    the same time, with the increasing growth of other sectors of the economy, water
    demand has increased and will increase further, creating more competition for
    agriculture and a wider gap between demand for and supply of irrigation water
    in agriculture. Future demand for water by different sectors of the economy such
    as urban centers, industries, and infrastructure in 2030 and 2050 scenarios has
    been estimated to be significantly high (Table 4). It is estimated that by 2050,
    total water demand in India by all sub-sectors (1180 BCM) will surpass the total
    utilizable water resources of the country (NCIWRD, 2015) and that agriculture''s
    share will be reduced to 68% (Table 4); hence, cereal systems that produce the
    major share of food will have to be sustained with a much smaller quantity of
    water, and with poor quality water. Therefore, the productivity of cereal systems
    will have to be improved through precision management of irrigation water while
    protecting the groundwater resources. Table 4. Current and projected future water

    3. Current status of water management in agriculture: Tools and techniques By
    2025, more than one-third of the global population will face a severe shortage
    of water, with availability becoming increasingly scarce (Kassam et al., 2007;
    Rosegrant et al., 2002; Seckler et al., 1999). Semi-arid regions of Asia, the
    Middle-East, and sub-Saharan Africa, where a substantial part of the world''s
    population lives below the poverty line, will be the worst affected areas. The
    demand for food and other agricultural commodities in these areas with fast-growing
    populations is increasing, while the availability of fresh water continuously
    declines. As agriculture is a major consumer of water for irrigation in South
    Asia, there is an increasing need to re-allocate the water used for irrigation
    to domestic and industrial sectors, but this may seriously impair food security
    in the region. Sustainable management of water in agriculture aims to match water
    availability and needs in quantity and quality, in time and space, at affordable
    cost, and with acceptable environmental implications. The sustainability and economic
    health of irrigated agriculture will depend on the ability of producers to adapt
    to growing constraints on water, particularly by improving efficiency of water
    use. Efficient water use not only reduces production costs, but also increases
    profitability by reducing loss of nutrients. Managing irrigation water at field
    scale can be improved by quantifying the water balance and using advanced techniques
    for scheduling irrigation, to achieve a more effective and economic use of limited
    water supplies. Reduced availability of water for irrigation may result in lowered
    productivity of irrigated crops, especially rice that consumes about 120–180 cm
    ha− 1 of water (Bindraban et al., 2006; Chauhan et al., 2012; Jat et al., 2019a).
    However, over years of advancements in research, several tools and techniques
    have been developed for various production systems and ecologies that help in
    saving water and improving water productivity in agriculture. For cereal-based
    systems, different methods of irrigation (flood, furrow, micro-irrigation) are
    being practiced by farmers (Fig. 1), the most common being flood irrigation (Jat
    et al., 2019a; Sidhu et al., 2019). Flood irrigation is the traditional system
    practised in South Asia of providing protective irrigation to crops. In this method,
    fields can be irrigated in two ways: by using earthen (unlined) or brick-lined
    channels, or by using underground cement, concrete or high-density polyethylene
    (HDPE) pipes. The conveyance losses are greater when using unlined channels for
    flood irrigation as compared to using cemented or HDPE underground pipes. The
    efficiency of flood irrigation largely depends upon field size and soil type,
    as the greatest loss of water is due to leaching beyond the root zone. Flood irrigation
    in unlevel fields causes temporary waterlogging in low-lying areas and adversely
    affects the productivity of upland field crops (wheat, maize, and pulses). Waterlogging
    is more severe and prolonged in soils used for growing rice, as puddling leads
    to the development of a hard pan (having low permeability) at shallow depths in
    such soils, which can adversely affect the productivity of upland crops (e.g.,
    wheat) that follow rice (Kukal and Aggarwal, 2003). Download : Download high-res

    cereal-based systems. Furrow irrigation is generally used in raising vegetables
    and potatoes, but furrow-irrigated raised beds (FIRB) are also being used to a
    limited extent for growing wheat, maize and other crops. A saving in the requirement
    for irrigation water (IW) has also been reported for rice and many other crops
    on raised beds (Choudhary et al., 2018; Jat et al., 2005, Jat et al., 2012, Jat
    et al., 2013; Kukal et al., 2009; Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2009). Several studies
    conducted across South Asia show a significant reduction (20%–30%) in the use
    of irrigation water for different cereal crops and cropping systems (Chauhan et
    al., 2012; Choudhary et al., 2018; Humphreys et al., 2010; Ibragimova et al.,
    2007; Jat et al., 2012, Jat et al., 2013; Sarker et al., 2020). 3.1. Micro-irrigation
    in agriculture: Progress and prospects Precision water-management technologies
    like micro-irrigation (sprinkler, surface drip and subsurface drip) help cultivators
    not only in saving irrigation water, but also in reducing the cost of production
    through efficient use of fertilizers and reduced cost of labor and other agricultural
    inputs (Madhavan, 2020; Narayanamoorthy, 2006). Micro-irrigation systems provide
    a 35%–65% saving of water compared with traditional flood irrigation systems,
    along with an appreciable increase in the productivity of crops and the income
    of farmers (ICFA, 2017; Jat et al., 2019a, Jat et al., 2019b; Sidhu et al., 2019).
    The advantages of micro-irrigation in terms of a significant increase in efficiency
    of water use have already been demonstrated beyond doubt (Narayanamoorthy, 2003;
    Palanisami et al., 2011; Rajkhowa et al., 2015; Rajput and Patel, 2012; Soman,
    2020; Soman et al., 2018). Despite multiple benefits and government support, the
    adoption of micro-irrigation in South Asian countries is very low compared to
    that in developed countries like Russia, USA, Brazil, Israel, Spain, China, etc.
    (Fig. 2; ICFA, 2017). In South Asia, the largest acreage under micro-irrigation
    is in India, where it has seen a steady growth over the years. Since 2005, the
    area covered under micro-irrigation systems has grown at a compound annual growth
    rate (CAGR) of 9.6% (Anonymous, 2016). Of the total acreage under micro-irrigation,
    sprinkler systems account for 56% and drip irrigation systems for 44%; drip irrigation
    is increasing at a faster rate, having a CAGR of 9.85% during 2012–2015, while
    sprinkler irrigation has grown at a pace of 6.60% in the same time period (Priyan
    and Panchal, 2017). The current acreage under micro-irrigation in India is 7.73
    m ha, whereas there is a potential of > 42 m ha (ICFA, 2017). Furthermore, there
    is a wide variation in adoption in various states of India (Table 5), with the
    largest areas under micro-irrigation being Rajasthan (1.68 m ha), Maharashtra
    (1.27 m ha), Andhra Pradesh (1.16 m ha), Karnataka (0.85 m ha), Gujarat (0.83
    m ha) and Haryana (0.57 m ha). Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download

    India. 3.1.1. Sprinkler irrigation Sprinkler irrigation technology, a system of
    pressurized micro-irrigation, where irrigation water is generally applied over
    the crop canopy in an identical way to rainfall, was introduced in the world about
    a century ago, but its increased use for larger areas started during the past
    few decades (Shankar et al., 2015). Water is pumped through a system of aluminum
    or HDPE pipes for distribution. Sprinkler systems eliminate water loss through
    leakage and seepage in conveyance channels. Water is more uniformly distributed
    even in an uneven field, thereby reducing wastage (Shankar et al., 2015). Compared
    to conventional flood irrigation, by using the sprinkler system for cereals and
    other field crops, a significant saving in irrigation water (30%–70%) for various
    crops grown in different soil types and agro-ecologies has been reported across
    the globe (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010; Colaizzi et al., 2006; Deen et al., 2012;
    Humphreys et al., 1989; Kahlown et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2004; Liu and Kang,
    2006). 3.1.2. Surface drip irrigation Surface drip irrigation is a low-volume
    irrigation system which applies irrigation water (IW) to plants by trickling water
    drop by drop near their roots at the soil surface. This irrigation system distributes
    water as well as nutrients through a network of pipes, valves, and emitters. Apart
    from highly efficient and uniform IW application and prevention of soil loss due
    to erosion, the fertigation also reduces nutrient loss due to leaching. However,
    the system requires a high initial capital investment and a high cost of labor
    for moving laterals etc. during the cropping season. A large number of studies
    in different crops and especially cereal systems across the world (Chen et al.,
    2015; Chouhan et al., 2015; Leib et al., 2002; Moin and Kamil, 2018; Parthasarathi
    et al., 2015, Parthasarathi et al., 2018; Pawar et al., 2013; Sharda et al., 2017;
    Sidhu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013) have reported that drip irrigation systems
    help make a significant saving (up to 50%) of water in cereals (wheat, rice, corn)
    and other crops in comparison to flood irrigation. 3.1.3. Sub-surface drip irrigation
    In contrast to the surface drip irrigation system, the subsurface drip irrigation
    (SSDI) system reduces the labor cost for anchoring laterals during the cropping
    season and ensures a longer life of laterals (Jat et al., 2019a; Sidhu and Sidhu,
    2019). SSDI minimizes water loss from the soil surface due to evaporation (Ayars
    et al., 1999; Barker et al., 1999; Douh and Boujelben, 2011) and allows direct
    application of nutrients along with water to the crop root zone, which ensures
    a more efficient use of fertilizer, reduces the growth of weeds and cost of labor,
    and enables the performance of cultural operations with ease (Ayars et al., 2015;
    Camp, 1998; Camp et al., 1997; Camp and Lamm, 2003, Camp and Lamm, 2014; Howell
    et al., 1997; Jat, 2020; Lamm, 2002; Lamm and Camp, 2007; Lamm and Trooien, 2003;
    Pablo et al., 2007; Payero et al., 2008; Phene et al., 1991). Conservation agriculture
    (CA) systems integrate three major interventions, viz. zero tillage, crop rotation,
    and soil surface cover (mulch), which can potentially improve irrigation efficiency
    by simultaneously reducing evaporation and runoff and improving soil properties
    that help in better water retention and storage in the soil profile (Camp et al.,
    1999). Sidhu et al. (2019) have reported irrigation water savings of 48%–53% and
    42%–53% in rice and wheat, respectively, under layering of SSDI and CA compared
    to the traditional flood irrigated rice-wheat system. Further, Jat et al. (2019a)
    reported that SSDI saved 46.7% and 44.7% of irrigation water under CA-based RW-mungbean
    and MW-mungbean systems, compared to flood irrigated CA-based systems in the Indo-Gangetic
    plains of India. 4. Scheduling for drip irrigation systems Scheduling irrigation
    for any irrigation method determines the productivity and efficiency of any irrigation
    system. Irrigation scheduling is not necessarily based on the full crop water
    requirement but is designed to ensure the optimal use of allocated water. In irrigated
    areas, water productivity (WP) can be improved with better systems for water conveyance,
    allocation, and distribution, and water losses can be drastically reduced by using
    advanced irrigation methods, including drip irrigation systems that allow water
    to be delivered precisely when and where it is needed (Rolaniya et al., 2015;
    Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2014). Saving irrigation water does not necessarily help
    in saving crop evapotranspiration (ET) that represents aquifer depletion (Humphreys
    et al., 2010). Therefore, optimal use of irrigation water in time and space involves
    scheduling its application with the aim of conserving water and optimizing crop
    yields based on scientific principles. Irrigation scheduling is a systematic process
    of estimating the irrigation water (IW) requirement that will avoid water stress
    in the crop over relatively short periods of time. Several researchers have developed
    improved irrigation schedules (timing and amount of irrigation) for flood-irrigated
    cereal-based systems (Prihar and Sandhu, 1987). Various common approaches for
    scheduling irrigation using different parameters, viz. crop evapotranspiration,
    plant observation, canopy temperature, soil moisture monitoring, etc. are given
    in Table 6 and are described in the succeeding section. Table 6. Various approaches
    for irrigation scheduling under field conditions. Irrigation scheduling approaches
    Parameters Plant observation-based Visible changes in plant appearance, such as
    leaf curling and wilting. Plant moisture status can also be measured using sap
    flow sensors, infrared guns, and pressure bombs, which measure leaf water potential
    Weather data-based Crop water loss is estimated on the basis of either evaporation
    from an open-pan (PE) water surface or historical climate data, such as length
    of the day (sunshine hours), maximum and minimum temperatures during the day,
    wind speed, and relative humidity. Irrigation schedules based on 0.9–1.2 IW/cumulative
    PE have been observed to be optimal for different crops Soil moisture monitoring-based
    Soil moisture used to assess water stress in the plants is measured by gravimetric
    (volume basis) and soil metric potential method. Use of a tensiometer is a most
    practical and simple tool for farmers to use for scheduling irrigation 4.1. Climate-based
    approaches Soil moisture availability and evapotranspiration (ET)-based crop water
    demand are better scientific practices than fixed schedule irrigation (e.g., weekly
    supply through canal commands) because of the low volume of IW application. Climate-based
    approaches to irrigation scheduling involve the use of a measure of cumulative
    potential evaporation (Allen et al., 1998). Potential evaporation is determined
    using open-pan evaporation, and reference ET is calculated from meteorological
    data in a variety of ways, but the modified Penman-Monteith method is generally
    preferred. Crop ET is calculated from potential ET using crop factors. Irrigation
    is scheduled after a pre-determined amount of ET has occurred, and this threshold
    amount varies with soil type (plant available water capacity (PAWC)), crop type
    (e.g., shallow versus deep-rooted crops) and stage of crop growth. The threshold
    is determined using information from past studies on crop water use. Optimal irrigation
    means the application of water precisely equal to the ET of the crop. 4.2. Evaporation-based
    approach Irrigation scheduling based on evaporation involves the application of
    IW based on moisture deficit in the soil profile to a level that does not start
    to affect the crop growth. The frequency of irrigation is set to correspond to
    the time period required for moisture depletion to about 50% of the field capacity
    of the soil. To maintain plant health, the estimated reduction in soil moisture
    due to loss through ET is made up (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Carefully managed deficit-irrigation
    of crops has high potential to significantly reduce IW demand, due to the huge
    extent of area under various crops. State-of-the-art delivery systems based on
    advanced irrigation technologies will be needed to implement successfully deficit-irrigation
    strategies. Prihar et al. (1974) proposed a simple concept for scheduling wheat
    irrigation on the basis of the ratio of the fixed depth of irrigation water (IW)
    to the cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) since the previous irrigation (open pan
    evaporation (Pan E) minus amount of rain). The quantity of IW is worked out depending
    on the permissible moisture deficit in the soil profile (Prihar et al., 1978).
    The deficit-irrigation practice propagates the use of moisture stored in the soil
    profile by extending the depth of the root zone through an increase in the length
    of roots along with the receding moisture front. Deficit irrigation has been reported
    to save two irrigations of wheat out of the six normally applied without any penalty
    on crop productivity (Balwinder-Singh et al., 2011b; Prihar et al., 1976). 4.3.
    Soil-based approach Irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture includes assessing
    the soil moisture status (volumetric soil water content or matric potential) within
    the root zone, and knowing the wilting point for irrigation of a specific crop.
    Initially, the moisture level is raised up to field capacity, and as water is
    consumed by the crop, it is applied to the crop as per requirement. Water budgeting
    is a quantitative method wherein current models to estimate ET based on temperature
    and crop water use are employed. If ET during the season exceeds effective rainfall,
    it is necessary to irrigate to sustain crops in the field. Once the ET rate of
    a location is known, the volume of IW determined may be applied at a known rate
    in a given time through a calibrated irrigation system, and 10% extra water may
    be applied to account for the losses in the delivery system. The available water
    in the root zone is the volumetric soil moisture content between permanent wilting
    point and field capacity of the soil, and the irrigation threshold is generally
    expressed as percentage depletion of total available water. A number of techniques
    used for determining volumetric soil water content are neutron attenuation, time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR), and capacitance (Charlesworth, 2005). Alternatively, irrigation
    can be scheduled based on soil matric potential (SMP), at an explicit depth in
    the soil profile (Balwinder-Singh et al., 2011a; Kakraliya et al., 2018). SMP
    is linked directly to the energy needed by the plant to extract moisture from
    the soil. Tensiometers and granular matrix sensors are most commonly used for
    determining SMP, and these can be logged or manually read. A tube tensiometer
    is an easy to use, robust and relatively inexpensive device. It consists of a
    plastic tube connected to a porous ceramic cup at one end and to a vacuum gauge
    at the other. Tensiometers provide in situ soil moisture content in real time
    and are accurate measures of SMP in the moisture range from 0 to about − 80 kPa,
    which is the moisture range required for major crops. The threshold value of SMP
    for scheduling irrigation depends on the type of crop to be grown. Based on this
    criterion, Kukal et al. (2005) recommended that puddled transplanted rice (PTR)
    should be irrigated at an SMP of − 16 kPa measured at a soil depth of 20 cm. For
    scheduling irrigation under different tillage and mulch treatments, Gupta et al.
    (2016) recommended an SMP of − 35 kPa at a soil depth of 32.5 cm for wheat, and
    − 15 kPa at a 17.5 cm soil depth for dry seeded rice. 4.4. Plant-based approach
    Plant-based irrigation scheduling is based on the physiological and phenological
    conditions of the crop. The physiological condition (water stress level) can be
    judged from canopy temperature (O’Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010) depression relative
    to air temperature (measured by infrared thermometry), and then calculation of
    the cumulative stress degree days (SDD) (Idso et al., 1981) and crop water stress
    index (Jackson et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2004) can be used
    for scheduling irrigation. Phenological stages can also be used to determine when
    to irrigate. In wheat, critical growth stages for irrigation are crown root initiation
    (CRI), tillering, jointing, flowering, and the grain-filling stage. Water stress
    at any of these stages may result in loss of yield depending upon the severity
    of the stress. Das et al. (1985) reported that the canopy temperature minus the
    air temperature (Tc-Ta) for wheat under stressed conditions was higher than under
    unstressed conditions throughout the season. The Tc-Ta could explain the 55% variation
    in wheat yield in a sandy loam soil, and this index could be used as a tool to
    assess crop water status and hence to schedule irrigation (Buttar et al., 2005).
    Gontia and Tiwari (2008) concluded that the crop water stress index based on Tc-Ta
    and vapor pressure deficit could be used for monitoring plant water status and
    planning irrigation schedules in central India. However, this technique is costly
    and may not be economically feasible for smallholder farmers. Moreover, all irrigation
    techniques require a better understanding of the sensitivity of crops to water
    stress and its ecological and physiological basis, which generally varies through
    the different stages of crop growth (Zhang et al., 1999). 4.5. Deficit-irrigation
    approach Deficit irrigation (DI) is a water-saving irrigation strategy used in
    many parts of the world (Fernández et al., 2013) in which IW is applied at lower
    amounts than the full crop water requirement (i.e., ET), thereby increasing water
    use efficiency (WUE). It has been argued that the level of irrigation supplied
    under DI should be between 60% and 100% of ET. Water productivity (WP) increases
    under DI, relative to its value under full irrigation, since small amounts of
    irrigation increase crop ET more or less linearly up to a point when yield reaches
    its maximum value, and additional amounts of irrigation do not increase it any
    further. The location of that point is not easily defined and thus, when water
    is not limited, irrigation is applied in excess to avoid the risk of a yield penalty.
    The amount of IW saving and improved WP under DI strongly depends on crop (and
    cultivar), planting date, soil, and site specifications, and is generally accompanied
    by no or minor yield loss (Ahmadi et al., 2010b). In particular, many crops have
    different sensitivities to water stress at various stages of development, and
    the DI program must be designed to manage the stress so that yield decline is
    minimized. Information regarding the crop response to DI is essential to achieve
    such objectives when water is limited. In DI, irrigation water is applied during
    the drought-sensitive growth stages of a crop to maximize the water productivity,
    by allowing the crops to sustain some degree of water deficit and yield reduction
    (Fereres and Soriano, 2007). For DI, it is necessary to identify the critical
    growth stages of the various crops with respect to their water demand, and irrigation
    needs to be applied at critical growth stages to realize the maximum WUE. Ali
    et al. (2007) suggested that crown root initiation (CRI) and booting to heading
    are the two most sensitive growth stages of wheat, and that drought stress should
    be avoided during these stages. To quantify the level of DI, it is necessary to
    define the full ET requirements of the crop. When irrigation is applied at rates
    below the ET, the crop extracts water from the soil reservoir to compensate for
    the deficit. Two situations may then develop: in one case, if sufficient water
    is stored in the soil and transpiration is not limited by soil water, even though
    the volume of IW is reduced, the ET and yield are unaffected; in the other case,
    if the soil water supply is insufficient to meet the crop demand, growth and transpiration
    are reduced, and DI induces an ET reduction below its maximum potential (Yadvinder-Singh
    et al., 2014). If the stored soil water that was extracted is replenished by seasonal
    rainfall, the DI practice is sustainable and has the advantage of reducing IW
    use. In some situations, both water use and ET are reduced by DI, but yields may
    be negatively affected. In the rice-wheat (RW) system in Punjab, India, around
    four irrigations are recommended for the wheat crop at different growth stages,
    and the amount of these generally turns out to be lower than the actual amount
    of ET of the crop. It is perhaps the water stored in the profile during the preceding
    rice-crop season that is used for supplying the extra water to be used for meeting
    the ET requirements of the wheat crop. Research indicates that DI can increase
    the WP of wheat, maize, and rice by 10%–42% (Soundharajan and Sudheer, 2009).
    Deficit irrigation (DI) can also save water by reducing the IW depth by watering
    only the plant root zone, and increasing the interval between successive irrigations.
    Results of field experiments conducted in Dhenkanal, Odisha (India) showed that
    with two supplemental irrigations, the WP of maize, groundnut, sunflower, wheat,
    and potato was 0.55, 0.22, 0.23, 0.41, and 2.27 kg m− 3, and the application of
    three irrigations resulted in WP enhancement by 40%, 14%, 22%, 38% and 7%, respectively
    (Kar et al., 2004). It has been suggested that yields and WP could increase even
    more if DI was used in combination with water conservation practices (e.g., mulching)
    or rainwater harvesting techniques (Ali and Talukder, 2008). Studies conducted
    in China showed that ridge furrow planting combined with the DI system significantly
    increased wheat and maize yields and WP compared with the conventional flood irrigation
    method, and this system has been widely adopted in many parts of northwest China
    (Zhou et al., 2011). Another form of DI, partial root-zone drying (PRD), increases
    WP while margining the crop yield under limited water resources. Partial root-zone
    drying is a novel improvement of DI in which each half of the root zone is irrigated
    alternately in scheduled irrigation events (Ahmadi et al., 2010a). From an exhaustive
    review, Sepaskhah and Ahmadi (2010) concluded that in comparison to the DI strategy,
    PRD is a successful alternative irrigation technique compared to full irrigation
    that can save up to approximately 50% of IW without significant yield loss and
    thereby improve the WP. It is necessary with this technique to irrigate the two
    sides of the root system alternately to keep the roots in the dry soil alive and
    fully functional and sustain the supply of root signals (Kang et al., 2004). Alternate
    or every-other-furrow irrigation is also considered as PRD irrigation. Alternate
    furrow irrigation has been successfully used as a water-saving irrigation method
    (Grimes et al., 1968). Partial root drying has been adopted for different crops
    by using alternate furrow irrigation, resulting in higher WP (Sepaskhah and Ahmadi,
    2010). 5. Designing automated drip irrigation systems Irrigation systems in South
    Asia are still manually operated. However, feeding the growing population under
    the projected scenario of limited water availability and increased demand due
    to climate change (Barnett et al., 2005; Kayatz et al., 2019; Misra, 2014), needs
    an infusion of modern tools and technologies especially for making more precise
    use of water resources for irrigation (Ojha et al., 2015). Semi-automated and
    automated field irrigation systems are now being introduced to replace conventional
    uncontrolled surface irrigation systems. An automatic irrigation system can irrigate
    fields according to available soil moisture, soil type and climatic requirement
    for the crop-water relationship. These devices are ideally suited for irrigating
    fields precisely through surface, sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in the
    prevailing situation of water and labor shortages. Intelligent, sensor-based irrigation
    systems can help to achieve better yield per drop with optimal water use, through
    significantly improving water use efficiency (Jha et al., 2018; Ojha et al., 2015).
    5.1. Sensors and methods Automated precision irrigation is a data-centric approach
    and requires real-time data on soil moisture, temperature and weather parameters
    (Awati and Patil, 2012; Giri and Pippal, 2016). The sensors are employed for real
    time monitoring/sensing these parameters, and are useful for planning irrigation
    systems (El-Marazky et al., 2011). As well as monitoring soil moisture content,
    the sensors assess precisely the crop water demand from weather data. Initially,
    tensiometers and granular matrix sensors were used for estimating soil moisture
    to automate the control of irrigation water. Electromagnetic-based sensors (Blonquist
    et al., 2006) were also used and showed promise for the real-time estimation of
    soil moisture. Information from the moisture sensor is provided as input to the
    microcontroller that transforms the data from analog to digital. The microcontroller
    transmits the data using a radio-frequency (RF) module. The Bluetooth- and Wi-Fi-based
    wireless transmitter can transmit these data to the base station (Kim et al.,
    2008). The microcontroller LCD displays the soil moisture and flow levels. This
    facilitates remote assessment of the field conditions and real time monitoring
    of the variable-rate irrigation controller. An irrigation controller is employed
    to operate a solenoid valve that supplies water to crops when soil moisture content
    falls below a pre-defined critical point (Nemali and Van Iersel, 2006). When the
    soil moisture content is low, the power automatically switches on the pump and
    water from the tank starts flowing through the pipe; when the soil moisture reaches
    a pre-defined, soil-specific saturation limit, the power turns off and the water
    stops. A typical example of automation is a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    drip irrigation system that comprises different types of sensors, viz. soil moisture
    sensors that are positioned over the entire farm, and wind speed and direction
    sensors. Multiple wireless sensor nodes and a gateway consisting of a sensor-based
    wireless monitoring system (Joaquín et al., 2013) provide a unique and easy solution
    with improved spatial and sequential resolutions for automated precision irrigation.
    In some systems, irrigation scheduling is accomplished by using a tensiometer
    to measure soil metric potential (SMP) that determines the soil moisture content,
    for operating drip irrigation through an automated controller system. The fuzzy
    logic system, which works on the principle of assigning a particular output depending
    on the probability of the state of the input, can improve the reliability of the
    estimated value of the irrigation amount and facilitate decision-making. Some
    researchers are also working on variable-rate sensors for improving the efficiency
    of irrigation systems. Various researchers have used different approaches and
    controllers for the automation of drip irrigation systems. Two of the early researchers,
    Phene and Howell (1984) first employed a custom-made SMP sensor to control irrigation
    of subsurface-drip-irrigated tomatoes. They observed that the productivity of
    tomatoes raised under an automated irrigation system was similar to the productivity
    of those irrigated on the basis of pan evaporation (PE), but with substantial
    savings in irrigation water. Meron et al. (1995) operated a control system for
    drip irrigation of apple trees using tensiometers equipped with an analog output
    transducer. The server side was used for data analysis, and the decisions on the
    drip irrigation were taken based on an algorithm of data mining. Jain et al. (2016)
    used an RF module along with a remote monitoring unit for automation of an irrigation
    system. Ojha et al. (2015) undertook a critical review of the available evidence
    on the deployment of WSNs in international and national scenarios, and the potential
    use of these in the advancement of different applications in agriculture. WSNs
    and ICTS play a key role in enhancing the application of precision technologies
    in agriculture, viz. monitoring of soil moisture, weather and crops in real time
    (Blonquist et al., 2006; Chetana and Rutuja, 2012; Fernández et al., 2013; Kim
    et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2014; Nam et al., 2017; Nikolidakis et al., 2015; Ojha
    et al., 2015; Pierce and Elliott, 2008; Watras et al., 2014). Table 7 lists various
    sensors and methods currently being used in automated irrigation systems. Table

    Communication techniques 5.1.1.1. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) Communication
    without using wires reduces the cost and increases the overall efficiency of domestic
    Internet installations. Wireless communication can be put to crucial use for managing
    agricultural land and monitoring farm operations. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    are recognized as a powerful tool for collecting and processing data for low-cost
    and low-energy precision agriculture (Wang et al., 2006). WSNs provide high spatial
    and temporal resolution for monitoring soil and crop parameters via wirelessly-connected
    sensor nodes installed across the field (Akyildiz and Wang, 2005; Yang et al.,
    2007) that automatically transmit data in multi-hop mode. Technological advances
    in microcontrollers and wireless communication have led to the development of
    embedded devices (nodes) that are smaller and have a higher capability for sensing,
    measuring, controlling, transmitting, processing and storing information. WSNs
    can thus improve the monitoring of plants and soil, and can improve productivity,
    efficiency and profitability while minimizing risks due to climatic aberrations,
    water shortages, pest infestation and other factors hostile to crop growth and
    development. WSNs are helping to achieve better response times due to real-time
    sensing and communication. There are multiple ways for irrigation scheduling to
    use wireless sensors. Based on the threshold values of temperature and soil moisture
    content, the gateway allows automated actuation of the irrigation system. Some
    of the sensors, modules and valves that are commercially available for assembly
    in an irrigation network are quite complex and expensive to be deployed for managing
    fixed irrigation systems. The cost and complexity of installation, operation and
    maintenance of these systems have been limiting factors in their adoption. Sensor-based
    automated systems are of two types: (1) systems that assess soil moisture content
    based on the measurement of various weather and other parameters; and (2) systems
    that measure soil moisture content directly using sensors (Zazueta and Smajstrla,
    1992). A WSN can be used in diverse environments and has advantages over a wired
    network in terms of size, flexibility, distributed intelligence and cost (Sandhya
    and Ramesh, 2018). Certain other advantages of wireless transmission include its
    potential for deployment in areas where cabling is not feasible, as well as its
    greater simplification and significant cost savings over cabling. Soil moisture
    content and temperature are transmitted wirelessly, thereby permitting the adjustment
    of the water supply to daily weather fluctuations or to variations in the volumetric
    soil profile moisture (Grant et al., 2009). Adoption of wireless technologies
    eliminates 20%–80% of cabling costs in the setting up of industries. Water distribution
    in a field for agricultural production can be properly monitored through the use
    of wireless sensor networks. The components of a WSN application are a sensor
    node, master node, database and base station (BS). Wireless sensor networks based
    on communication technology and microcontrollers can improve existing monitoring
    methods to suitably support real-time response for a wide array of applications.
    Recent developments in wireless technology and microelectronics have led to the
    creation of low-power-consuming and low-cost components, crucial for such systems,
    especially WSNs (Vergari et al., 2009). In a sensor network, different communication
    technologies such as Zigbee, WI-FI, Bluetooth, RF, and General Packet Radio Service
    (GPRS)) have been put to use for efficient communication between the elements
    of a network—the sensor nodes and data receiver—and the network itself. Zigbee
    technology that carries small amounts of data over a short distance is suitable
    for a small farm, whereas for automation of multiple sensors in larger areas where
    Wi-Fi technology can be used, Zigbee technology is the preferred choice among
    various wireless technologies due to its efficiency in low-power connectivity
    and its ability to connect a large number of items of equipment into a single
    network. Zigbee technology utilizes a license-free and globally available 2.4
    GHz frequency band. It allows wireless applications for personal area wireless
    networks, using a standardized set of high-level communication protocols sitting
    atop a cost-effective, low-power digital radio based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
    Another mode of communication is based on a cellular internet interface (GPRS
    protocol) using a mobile data service cellular global system. The GPRS permits
    mobile phones a continuous connectivity to the network and transfers desired data
    promptly. The GPRS technology is more practical and useful due to its ability
    to transfer data; it is able to both receive and send data during a call without
    disconnecting it. Internet connectivity allows for real-time data inspection on
    the website. Its low cost permits wider use of the technology in remote control
    applications; mesh networking offers better reliability, and broad range and low
    power use permits batteries to be smaller with a longer life. The software, which
    works on a WSN and nodes, monitors the entire farm from a distant location using
    IoT. The network has two nodes: a camera node to monitor crops and collect images;
    and a sensor node that captures all the soil and environmental data, viz. temperature,
    hours of sunshine, soil moisture, air humidity, etc. Automation of the irrigation
    system is accomplished by linking two wireless sensor units (WSUs) through radio
    transceivers, which enable the transfer of data related to temperature, soil moisture
    and sunshine using XBee software and a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) module
    to convey the information via the public mobile network to a web server. Tracking
    the information online is enabled through devices with internet access or a smart
    phone Wi-Fi network. Pathan and Hate (2016) used a different set of sensors, viz.
    temperature sensor LM35, LDR, and soil moisture sensor. Awati and Patil (2012)
    and Hussain et al. (2013) have demonstrated a Zigbee-based wireless protocol for
    drip irrigation. A WSN application based on radio frequency identification (RFID)
    and quick response (QR) codes was proposed by Nam et al. (2017) for the management
    of irrigation systems. An application of Wi-Fi modules and circuitry design of
    sensors for automated irrigation is depicted in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res
    image (181KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. An application of Wi-Fi
    modules and circuitry design of sensors for automated irrigation. Gutierrez et
    al. (2014) developed and tested a microcontroller and wireless communication-based
    WSN system for an experiment in automated irrigation of malt barley. The system
    comprised two components: wireless sensor units (WSUs) in the field; and a wireless
    information unit (WIU), connected by radio transceivers that enabled the transmission
    of data on soil moisture content and temperature, using Zigbee technology to implement
    a WSN. It was operated by photovoltaics and comprised distributed networks of
    temperature- and soil-moisture sensors installed in the root zone of the crop.
    Every sensor node included a temperature probe, a soil moisture probe, a radio
    transceiver, a microcontroller for data acquisition, and a microcontroller-based
    receiver to which the sensed data were transmitted. This gateway allowed the automatic
    actuation of irrigation as soon as temperature and soil moisture values reached
    the threshold values. The gateway device also handled information from sensors,
    triggered actuators, and communicated the information to the web application.
    Threshold values of temperature and soil moisture were used to develop an algorithm
    that was programmed to control quantity of water through a gateway based on microcontrollers.
    A cellular-Internet interface-based duplex communication connection enabled the
    system to inspect the data and schedule irrigation through web-based programming.
    Mafuta et al. (2013) further improved this WSN-based, solar-powered, robust and
    automated irrigation system. The end nodes sense soil temperature and soil moisture
    content and transmit the information to the coordinator node. Based on this data,
    the coordinator node decides whether to irrigate the field or not. The coordinator
    node forwards the information on soil temperature, soil moisture, valve status,
    battery level and performance of wireless link through an Xbee unit to the gateway
    node that transmits it to a remote station via a cellular network. Major advantages
    of the system are adequate irrigation and higher energy efficiency due to power-saving
    modes. However, the primary issues with the system are that it ignores sunshine
    duration, air humidity, and wind speed when determining reference ET, which reduces
    the efficiency of irrigation, and it has a lower coverage area because of the
    Xbee devices (Yu et al., 2015). 5.1.1.2. Internet of Things (IoT) for precision
    irrigation systems Anbarasi et al. (2019) proposed an IoT application-based smart
    irrigation system to improve crop yield, wherein the decision is taken on the
    basis of real-time data from the soil. This automated irrigation system switches
    the pump ON and OFF based on the moisture content of the soil. A soil moisture
    sensor measures the exact soil moisture content, and this input operates the pumping
    motor through an operational amplifier. Farmers can see the soil moisture status
    in a mobile application or web page using a modem through IoT. They can check
    whether the water sprinklers are turned ON or OFF at any time. This model includes
    a sensor hub and a control hub. In a multi-cropping system, information about
    soil moisture content is required because information about an assortment of yields
    is stored, and this is confirmed with the information detected by the sensors.
    This system reduces the physical contribution of the irrigator and improves efficiency
    and thus productivity. In rural areas with a serious rainfall deficiency, this
    model can be used effectively to achieve extraordinary outcomes with most soils.
    By and large, the water system framework will prompt improvements to tackle the
    social, financial, natural and societal issues of the farming community. Sani
    et al. (2019) designed an IoT-based irrigation monitoring and control system,
    using different sensors and actuators, for facilitating a smart irrigation system
    to provide an autonomous supply of an adequate amount of water from a reservoir
    to crops. The main objective was to enable users to monitor and control the remote
    farm independently, in order to improve crop productivity. The system employed
    a soil moisture sensor to estimate soil water content, a pump to supply the desired
    amount of irrigation water to the crop, and a Wi-Fi module to access sensed data
    via the Internet. The sensor readings that were communicated to the Internet in
    real time were stored on a web server that served as the main base station. The
    flow chart for the process is given in Fig. 4. Based on the analysis of these
    readings, a user can monitor precisely the soil moisture content in the field.
    The system notifies the farmer in real time about any inadequacy or excess in
    the supply of irrigation water, as the water pump is turned off or on depending
    on the moisture content of the soil. Experimental and simulation results validate
    the flexibility and applicability of the proposed system, and are of the utmost
    importance for the users because through remote monitoring and control of irrigation
    supplies, the system reduces the cost of supervision. Source: Modified and updated

    system for mobile communications (GSM)-based wireless network for automated irrigation
    systems There are several studies on different crops around the world that have
    used the GSM-based wireless network for an automated irrigation system. Chaware
    et al. (2015) proposed an automatic irrigation system for shallow-rooted crops
    like vegetables, where the moisture sensors were mounted near the root zone of
    the plants to sense and provide the output. These measured values were then fed
    to the controller that sent these to the user via the GSM modem. Information about
    the time of sensing, status of water availability and water requirement of the
    crop would be provided along with the starting of the motor. The system navigates
    through a controller that can optimally handle the sensors for soil moisture assessment
    with a low requirement of energy. Tope and Patel (2016) designed a system consisting
    of two units: a transmitter unit and a receiver unit, to determine the parameters
    effectively with the use of sensors for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
    A soil moisture probe comprising several moisture sensors measures the soil moisture
    content. 2.4 GHz ISM band, XBee modules are commonly employed for efficient wireless
    data transmission without a license. The solar-powered system has a duplex communication
    link based on a cellular-Internet interface that permits data inspection and programming
    of the irrigation schedule through a web page. In this irrigation system, the
    use of solar power is significantly appropriate in situations where the supply
    of electrical power is expensive. A real-time system based on GSM and a Zigbee
    module is extremely versatile and cost-effective. A significant drawback of a
    GSM technology-based WSN is that the water level in this system is not continuously
    monitored. 5.2. Case studies of different irrigation automation schemes 5.2.1.
    Tensiometer and capacitance-based automation Tensiometers and capacitance are
    used for detecting soil moisture in designing automated irrigation systems. Testezlaf
    et al. (1997) designed and evaluated an automated irrigation system for real-time
    water management in greenhouses. The irrigation system consisted of a pressure
    transducer-mounted tensiometer to monitor the soil water content in pots. The
    pressure transducers were chosen due to their high-level analog performance, low
    cost, low range of operating pressure, and accuracy. The transducers'' output
    voltages were interfaced to a PC via the input port of a digital/analog board
    responsible for the acquisition of data and the control system. The strategy for
    automated control utilized a closed loop unit that supplied irrigation water on
    demand. This strategy helped the system to sustain constant soil moisture content
    (soil metric potential set point). The control interface paused for a preset time
    interval termed “sensor response time” to continue to monitor the tension in the
    container for the next irrigation activity to take place. This was necessary to
    account for the time taken after water application for change in SMP to be measured
    by the tensiometer. The pumps were controlled by solid state relays. The system
    monitored accurately the water status of plants in the container, applied water
    according to the plants'' demand, and kept a record of applied water. However,
    Testezlaf and colleagues suggested further testing of the system at field level
    to assess its feasibility on a commercial scale. During testing at lower tension
    values, a significant variance was observed in the data recorded by sensors placed
    in similar substrate conditions in different containers. This variation in sensed
    data suggests that in managing an irrigation system relying on sensors that measure
    SMP, the number of plants being monitored, and whether these form a substantial
    sample of the total number of plants or of the experimental plot in the irrigation
    station should be considered. Lakshmiprasad et al. (2014) developed an intelligent
    irrigation system consisting of a server equipped with a microcontroller processor
    to measure different parameters. It utilized only one parameter at a time, e.g.,
    a soil moisture sensor to assess the moisture content. For instance, if we are
    using a soil moisture sensor for irrigation control in an automated drip irrigation
    system, then whenever the soil moisture level falls below the threshold value,
    then and only then does the system direct the valve to change from the OFF to
    the ON position, and when the soil moisture level reaches the optimum preset level
    then the system is switched OFF automatically. To measure the soil moisture content,
    a 10 HS coded soil moisture sensor was used. The sensor 10 HS used in this system
    has a low power requirement and a much higher resolution, and uses a capacitance
    technique to estimate the volumetric moisture content of the soil by determining
    its dielectric constant; it enables measurement as many times as required over
    a long period with a low battery usage. It has a GSM communication device that
    transmits the data to a farmer or receives it from a farmer who can take appropriate
    action. The system is also equipped with electrochemical sensors to assess the
    spatial variability of various chemical properties of the soil. The capacitance-based
    sensor consists of two metal plates separated by a polymer film that is non-conductive.
    This film gathers air moisture, which causes minor changes in voltage between
    these plates. These changes are converted into digital values indicating the moisture
    content of the air. The RS 232-level converter which performs between − 15 V and
    + 15 V, is used for serial communication. Recently, an automatic subsurface drip
    irrigation system based on WSNs using tensiometer-mounted SMP sensors has been
    designed and is being evaluated in the rice-wheat system at the research farm
    of BISA, Ladhowal (Ludhiana), Punjab, India. Results from initial observations
    reveal that the new automatic system performed well and delivered the desired
    quantity of irrigation water whenever SMP values fell below the pre-fixed threshold
    value (H.S. Sidhu, personal communication, 2018). The system is being evaluated
    on a large farm for its performance and further improvements if necessary. Stone
    et al. (1985) developed a magnificent, microcomputer-based, low-cost data-acquisition
    system to assess soil moisture potential continuously. The system comprises a
    tensiometer-mounted pressure transducer that performs well under field conditions.
    5.2.2. Smart phone and solar power-based irrigation automation A recent development
    in irrigation automation technology includes the use of sensor-based smart phone
    apps (Gutierrez et al., 2015). On activation of the app, the lighting circuit
    is switched on and the app takes a photograph of the soil; the lighting circuit
    is then switched off to save power. The RGB photo of the soil is transformed to
    a grayscale image wherein white pixels represent a dry area and dark pixels represent
    a wet area. Thereafter, the process of pixel segregation is started to determine
    the number of saturated pixels, which is the difference between the gray and light
    field matrices. A number is computed from the relatively wet soil, and the router
    node communicates this to the gateway node that controls the time of application
    of the irrigation water. This system has the advantages of reduced complexity
    of hardware, wide-ranging network coverage due to the use of Wi-Fi, and more energy
    efficiency due to being able to tap the mobile to put it into sleep mode. To arrive
    at a cumulative relatively wet soil area, more irrigation sensors have to be embedded
    in the smart phone, but that increases the cost of the system. Merlin et al. (2015)
    designed and tested an automated irrigation system using WSNs that is solar powered,
    reliable, and economical. As soon as wireless sensor nodes determine soil moisture,
    the measured value is compared with reference values by means of an on-stream
    camera. This actuates the valve for irrigation. When irrigation is not required,
    the microcontroller is in sleep mode, and when irrigation is required it shifts
    to active mode. The major advantages of the system are increased energy efficiency
    through using the power-saving mode, and dynamic irrigation. However, as air temperature,
    hours of sunshine, and wind speed are not considered for working out reference
    ET in this case, the irrigation efficiency of the system is reduced. 5.2.3. Combination
    of soil and weather sensors-based automation A combination of soil moisture sensors
    and weather sensors has also been advocated for automated irrigation by several
    researchers. Gokul et al. (2016) reviewed existing automated irrigation technologies.
    At present, mainly wireless LAN, Bluetooth, and Zigbee are used as transmission
    mediums from end nodes to sink node, which results in coverage of a lesser area.
    Some of the current methods only use soil moisture content and humidity values
    for deciding when to irrigate. However, crop water demand is also dependent on
    the duration and intensity of sunshine, wind speed, and air temperature, which
    contributes to a flawed estimation of the irrigation schedule. Further, use of
    an algorithm based on threshold values and fuzzy logic affects the precision of
    output. Several factors—the algorithm for determining reference ET, the capabilities
    of the sensor node to communicate and process the information, and likely exceptions
    during the application of irrigation—need special attention for efficient automated
    irrigation systems. Therefore, to achieve high precision, the combination of soil
    moisture sensors and weather-based sensors is highly useful. John et al. (2015)
    described a WSN for sensing the relative humidity of air, soil moisture, and temperature.
    The system comprises clusters of nodes, and the lifetime of the network node is
    improved through a sleep-wake up plan. A drip irrigation system automated with
    an effective routing protocol termed Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing Protocol
    (ECHERP) was evaluated by Nikolidakis et al. (2015). All the data sensed by the
    sensor nodes are forwarded to the base station that acts as a gateway to transmit
    these data to the server. This system employs the Priestley-Taylor method for
    determining the reference ET. The system also considers the historical data to
    make the irrigation automation process more useful by taking optimal irrigation
    decisions. This system has higher energy efficiency than other routing protocols
    like LEACH, TEEN and PEGASIS, and decisions based on historical data help in achieving
    high-impact optimal irrigation. The system has limitations, as humidity and duration
    of sunshine are not considered for estimating reference ET; in addition, irrigation
    efficiency is low, and the overall coverage range of the Zigbee protocol is also
    low. Similarly, Anurag et al. (2008) developed a WSN for precision irrigation
    wherein weather and environmental data are sensed and transmitted to a central
    repository in real-time. The network consisted of three separate sections: (i)
    sensor nodes; (ii) wireless mesh network; and (iii) actuation devices based on
    standards laid out in IEEE-802.15.4; the selection was based on four attributes
    suitable for commonly grown crops. They developed a new algorithm of static routing
    suitable for sensing applications. The tree-based routing can be most efficiently
    used as compared to other Zigbee-supported routing algorithms. Chikankar et al.
    (2015) used a Zigbee technology-based WSN with a tree-based structure to control
    soil moisture, air humidity, and temperature. They first prepared a pictorial
    topology with routers installed along the path at suitable distances. A basic
    algorithm was used to determine the address of various routers. The algorithm
    operated on an algorithm of the lowest depth first, i.e., the first address was
    assigned to the deepest router, and then it “worked up” the topology. The tracking
    needs to permit us for advance setting of addresses to maintain the tree structure.
    The actuation was accomplished based on information provided by the sensors. The
    system generated automatic warning messages on the console after the threshold
    value was exceeded, so that the requisite action could be initiated. At the controller
    end, these valve-based actuators were operated by discrete electrical switches.
    An RFID device was attached to each actuator to uniquely identify and control
    it. An automated drip irrigation system powered by photo photovoltaically and
    consisting of a distributed wireless network of temperature and soil moisture
    sensors is deployed in the crop root zone. Every sensor node includes a soil moisture
    sensor, temperature sensor, data acquisition microcontroller, and radio transceiver;
    the sensed data is communicated to a receiver that is also based on a microcontroller.
    The automated drip irrigation system developed by Nalini and Ramakrishna (2018)
    has three parts, viz. a humidity-sensing part, a control unit, and an output segment
    for deciding irrigation. The moisture content of the soil is sensed through a
    YL-69 soil sensor (a resistance-type sensor). The control unit consists of an
    Arduino microcontroller. The switching controls are of an on/off type that depends
    on soil moisture content. The soil moisture module consists of two parts, an amplifier
    circuit and the probes. The analog output provides information regarding plant
    moisture in real-time, and this output is used by the system. A water pump connected
    to the relay module works when this module receives such instruction from the
    microcontroller. The Arduino board is energized using a 7 V to 12 V solar panel,
    a plug-in adaptor or a wall wart. The smart irrigation system for automatic watering
    is depicted as a Block diagram in Fig. 5. Whenever the soil moisture content is
    low, the sensors detect the moisture change and signal to the microcontroller
    to start the pump. Download : Download high-res image (513KB) Download : Download

    on crop productivity and water saving Several studies carried out in different
    production systems and geographical areas across the world have demonstrated the
    tangible benefits of automated irrigation systems using different sensors (Table
    8) over traditional water management practices. In the extremely arid climatic
    conditions of Saudi Arabia, Al-Ghobari et al. (2017) measured crop productivity
    and water saving. They reported on the performance of an ET controller-based automated
    drip irrigation system on yields of wheat and tomato, and found significantly
    higher irrigation efficiency for the automated drip irrigation system (1.64 kg
    m− 3 for wheat and 6.50 kg m− 3 for tomato) than for the traditional drip irrigation
    control system (1.47 kg m− 3for wheat and 5.72 kg m− 3 for tomato). Thus, an automated
    drip irrigation system provides significant (up to 26%) saving of water along
    with higher crop productivity as compared to the conventional control system.

    sensor-based automated drip irrigation system with a non-automated drip system
    for okra (Abelmoschus esculents) and reported a substantial reduction in water
    use with the automated drip system. Using a microcontroller-based automated drip
    irrigation system for sweet corn that was irrigated when soil moisture content
    reached 70% of field capacity, Deekshithulu et al. (2018) reported 36% less water
    use as compared to the flood irrigation method, with respective water use of 332
    and 520 mm. 6. Artificial intelligence-based automated irrigation system Limited
    information is available for the prediction and analysis of agricultural data-based
    automated irrigation using wireless sensor-based systems and machine learning
    (to date, most such systems are either partly automated or even fully automated
    in some cases but limited to a small area). With the advances in machine-to-machine
    (M2M) platforms (Antón-Haro et al., 2013) that are a part of IoT, it has become
    possible for different devices to communicate with each other without human intervention.
    Machine learning has been used to monitor agricultural fields for the selection
    of crops, estimation of yields, and forecasting of diseases. This technology uses
    a rule editor tool to derive the irrigation rule. The tool also permits visualization
    of the measuring constraints and evaluated status. Several research studies have
    already been carried out on the use of wireless sensors and mobile computing for
    automating irrigation systems. Research is also being done on the application
    of machine learning in agricultural systems. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication
    is evolving as a scene-changing technology, as it allows objects and devices to
    interconnect with each other and transmit information to a server or a cloud through
    a core network. Shekhar et al. (2017) have developed an IoT-based intelligent
    automated drip irrigation system where moisture and temperature sensors have been
    placed in the field to capture data for its irrigation. The information supplied
    by the sensors to the gateway unit is forwarded to the control unit Raspberry
    pi that holds a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) machine learning algorithm for activating
    the water pump to irrigate the field. Information regarding the data analyzed
    is recorded in the Cloud server which can be accessed by farmers from their smart
    phone. The information from the temperature and moisture sensors is received as
    an input to the microcontroller to which these are connected. This is a fully
    automated system where the devices communicate with each other and use artificial
    intelligence for deciding the amount and timing of the water to be applied to
    the field. It reduces the requirement for human resources in carrying out irrigation.
    This automated drip irrigation system has been observed to be feasible and economical
    for optimal use of irrigation water for crop production. The irrigation system
    can be modified to meet the specific needs of the crop, and the maintenance requirements
    of such systems are also minimal. A comprehensive process for an intelligent irrigation

    of automated drip irrigation systems in cereal systems of South Asia 7.1. Plot-scale
    evidence on automated drip irrigation in the rice-wheat system A plot level study:
    one of the first experiments on an automated micro-irrigation system in a Conservation
    Agriculture (CA)-based rice-wheat rotation was carried out at the Borlaug Institute
    for South Asia (BISA), International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),
    Ludhiana, Punjab, India. The automated sensor was evaluated for both surface drip
    (SD) and subsurface drip (SSD) irrigation systems, and compared with conventional-till
    (CT) and zero-till (ZT) flood irrigated systems with rice-wheat rotation. The
    sensor-based, real-time irrigation systems (IRROMETER tensiometer with a magnetic
    switch having switching capability at the desired soil metric potential (SMP)),
    which sent a signal to the electrically operated tube-well and solenoid valve
    whenever the SMP fell below a predetermined critical level (− 15 kPa) in rice
    and (− 35 kPa) in wheat, were evaluated for crop yields and use of irrigation
    water. The grain yield of the rice-wheat systems varied significantly under four
    management scenarios with automated irrigation (CT with flood irrigation, ZT with
    flood irrigation, ZT with subsurface drip (ZT-SSD) and ZT with surface drip (ZT-SD).
    The results revealed that no-till coupled with the automated drip-irrigation system
    produced a significantly higher rice-wheat yield compared with the automated flood-irrigated
    system; conventional tillage coupled with the flood-irrigated system produced
    the lowest yield. The irrigation water productivity of the rice-wheat system was
    doubled from 1.13 to 2.28 kg/m3 under the no-till rice-wheat system coupled with
    automated subsurface drip irrigation, compared to the conventional-tillage, flood-irrigated
    system (Fig. 7). The results showed that MPS6 sensors could be used effectively
    for automated irrigation under both subsurface drip and flood conditions in rice-wheat
    rotation with a suitable communication device. Download : Download high-res image

    on automated drip irrigation systems A landscape-scale project on solar-powered
    micro-irrigation (Fig. 8), the first of its kind in the region, was commissioned
    in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab by the Department of Soil and Water Conservation,
    Government of Punjab, India in 2017. In this landscape model, an automated micro-irrigation
    pilot project covering 664 ha of land owned by1200 smallholder farmers, 15.7 cusec
    of water is lifted from three different points of a canal, conveyed to fields
    through underground pipelines, and used for irrigation at plot level through drip-
    and sprinkler-irrigation systems only. As a self-sustaining energy source, the
    system consists of around 3800 solar photovoltaic panels, generating 1.1 MW of
    energy and powering 46 pump sets of 20–25 hp capacity that convey water to farmers''
    fields through a fully remotely-automated system, combined with 8.6 km of HDPE,
    356.46 km of PVC underground pipelines, and 735.80 km of laterals (LLDPE) along
    with 213 solar tracking devices and 38,100 sprinkler units. The area under the
    pilot project has been divided into 378 smaller sections of 1.5 ha, each connected
    through 18 distribution lines equipped with pre-programmed time-based sensors
    and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) that transmit radio signals to the central server
    room; this is equipped with dedicatedly-developed Supervisory Control and Data
    Acquisition (SCADA) software for switching on/off the water supply as per availability
    and requirement. The duration of water flow in a particular distribution line
    to each section is pre-programmed as per type of crop and its water requirement,
    and regulated with valves controlled from the central server station, thus disseminating
    only a dedicated volume of water. Thus, over-irrigation and water wastage are
    prevented. The sectional valves are connected to drip or sprinkler irrigation
    systems, depending upon the crop grown for on-farm irrigation. The whole pilot
    is managed by 18 Water User Associations (WUAs), formed among participating farmers,
    that are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the project. The results
    indicate that there has been a significant increase in acreage under irrigation,
    cropping intensity, water productivity, and farmers'' income (GoP, 2020). This
    is one successful example of a landscape-scale automated micro-irrigation system
    in smallholder systems in South Asia. Download : Download high-res image (659KB)

    remains the backbone of South Asia''s economy and the largest (~ 90%) consumer
    of renewable water. With the increasing water scarcity in the region, particularly
    Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), agricultural production even at the current level
    might not be sustainable. Moreover, climate change is already negatively impacting
    the productivity of cereal crops in many parts of the region, and will have more
    serious impacts on future water availability and hence on cereal production. Therefore,
    major efforts are needed to conserve water through making the best use of every
    drop to produce more with it. Bundling new cutting-edge technologies such as micro-irrigation,
    and especially drip irrigation, coupled with automation in water application can
    help to increase efficiency of application and water productivity, especially
    in high water-consuming, cereal-based systems. Studies have shown that the use
    of appropriate irrigation methods (e.g., drip irrigation systems) coupled with
    soil- and climate-based approaches will lead to a large saving in irrigation water
    and increase in water productivity. However, recent advances in the development
    of WSNs have introduced a new dimension into the automation of drip irrigation,
    promoting the precision application of water and nutrients simultaneously. Research
    efforts are being made in irrigation automation to reduce investment, and in the
    operation and maintenance costs of the systems, while optimizing the output and
    improving energy efficiency. Most of the techniques discussed in this chapter
    use wireless LAN, Bluetooth, and XBee as the medium of communication between end
    nodes and sink nodes which results in lower area coverage. The technology issues
    at present are the optimization of the data measurement interval, optimal and
    efficient deployment strategies, routing protocols and energy-efficient medium
    access. Some of the existing methods rely mainly on soil moisture content and
    humidity values to decide the timing and amount of water for irrigation. Threshold-based
    algorithms and fuzzy logic are used in many existing techniques, which affects
    the accuracy of the output. The advances in sensor technology, i.e., time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR) and impedance-capacitance-based approaches, have contributed
    to the development of robust and less expensive devices that are better suited
    for different types of soils and for continuous monitoring of soil moisture content,
    and thus offer an opportunity for efficient irrigation-water management in most
    cropping systems. Several factors are responsible for the effective automation
    of irrigation, viz. algorithms for finding reference evapotranspiration, capability
    of sensor nodes in terms of communication, and storing and processing information.
    New technological advances, viz. sensor-cloud computing with improved data management
    and access control, big-data analytics for decision support systems to improve
    water productivity, and the Internet of Things (IoT), can provide flexible control
    mechanisms in real time for on-field parameters, and offer new opportunities in
    the development of futuristic applications for automated drip irrigation systems
    that can help to save water, energy and labor costs while improving crop and water
    productivity, as compared to traditional systems. 9. The way forward However,
    although during the past decade, there have been noteworthy advances in the use
    of WSNs for precision irrigation scheduling; many challenges in its field-scale
    application still remain. An “ideal” automated irrigation scheduling system should
    (i) have a low initial cost and minimal operating and maintenance costs; (ii)
    be reliable and robust; (iii) be able to reduce labor requirements significantly
    through automation; (iv) be sensitive to small changes in evaporative demand,
    soil moisture content, and plant responses; (v) be readily adaptable to different
    crops, their stages of growth or their environments without requiring much recalibration;
    (vi) permit continuous monitoring of soil water status, and rapidly respond to
    changing weather conditions in real time; and (vii) be user-friendly and require
    minimal training for users to operate and maintain. Further, to optimize the permissible
    benefits to the users and address their legitimate concerns, additional research
    and development efforts are required to standardize WSN protocols and communication
    frequencies, work with large datasets, and the calibration of sensors and equipment
    and their maintenance. Development of predictive models for the efficient use
    of irrigation water and nutrients is fast-maturing, but these need to be validated
    and verified for use in different environments. From the user point of view, there
    is a need to develop WSNs that are rapidly deployable in the field and have maximum
    utility at a minimal cost. The nodes should have low energy requirements, possibly
    with recharge options. The user, through a software interface, should be provided
    with an easily interpretable summary of the data collected by the sensors in real
    time, preferably as a customized output that allows large flexibility in actuating
    the irrigation control valves and other control devices. WSNs are rapidly maturing
    as a technology for precision irrigation scheduling and are likely to be propagated
    in future for promoting efficient water use in agriculture. The development of
    intelligent irrigation systems is going to play a crucial role in improving the
    sustainability of cereal systems and thereby the food security of nations in the
    future. Acknowledgments We sincerely acknowledge the support and contributions

    Water Management Citation Excerpt : It is therefore important to use suitable
    irrigation systems and management techniques that both save water and reduce leaching
    by reducing deep percolation. Deficit irrigation (DI) is a water-saving technique
    used in recent years in many parts of the world and especially in areas where
    water supply is limited, leads to improved water productivity and water use efficiency,
    since the amount of water applied is less than the total water needs of the crop,
    without compromising production (Fereres and Soriano, 2007; Asrey et al., 2018;
    Sidhu et al., 2021). Whereas, Partial Root-zone Drying (PRD) is a new form of
    DI that has significantly improved yield per unit of water applied compared to
    conventional irrigation (Sadras, 2009; Ahmadi et al., 2010), as well as improved
    water use efficiency without significant reduction in yield (Kang and Zhang, 2004;

    Citation Excerpt : However, the scarce water resources resulting from the low
    precipitation and frequent drought especially over the growing period of winter
    wheat, is a major factor that limits the wheat production in northwest China (Lu
    et al., 2022; Si et al., 2020). Water deficiency negatively influences crop growth
    and yield formation, because drought stress results in many plant physiological
    and biochemical reactions (Jiang et al., 2020; Sidhua et al., 2021; Liu et al.,
    2016). Irrigation, especially drip irrigation is conductive to saving water and
    improving crop photosynthesis and promoting dry matter accumulation, grain filling
    and yield formation (Cao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Madani et al., 2010; Yan

  description: Addressing the growing negative impacts on global food security due
    to sociopolitical and environmental challenges, this paper explores the potential
    of 5G networks and IoT-enabled unmanned agricultural robots in revolutionizing
    precision agriculture. We discuss how 5G networks facilitate real-time data collection
    and analysis from various sensors and IoT devices, empowering farmers to make
    informed decisions on irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, thereby increasing
    crop yields and reducing environmental impacts. Moreover, we examine the implementation
    challenges of WSN and 5G networks in precision agriculture applications and offer

    IEEE Conference Location: Istanbul, Turkiye SECTION I. Introduction The growing
    global population and the pressing need for increased food production present
    significant challenges for the agricultural sector. Conventional agricultural
    practices often lead to resource overutilization, waste generation, and inconsistent
    productivity. To address these issues, the fourth agricultural revolution is emerging,
    driven by precision farming, information and communication technology, and digital
    innovations such as 5G Networks, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Blockchain,
    Digital Twin, and Artificial Intelligence. These advancements enable farmers to
    make better decisions using real-time data, reduce manual farm control, and develop
    cyber-physical management systems for improved efficiency and sustainability [1].
    However, the agricultural sector also faces the impacts of sociopolitical and
    environmental factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic,
    and climate change, which further underscore the need for transformative digital
    solutions in agriculture to ensure global food security and resilience. Smart
    Farming, so-called Agri 4.0 [2], is a data-driven approach to agriculture that
    leverages information and communication technologies to increase farming efficiency,
    productivity, and sustainability. It is based on collecting and analyzing real-time
    data from various sources such as weather, temperature, humidity, pH level, water
    level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight, such that farmers can make more informed
    decisions about planting, fertilizing, and harvesting. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) consist of diverse sensors responsible for sensing and data forwarding to
    facilitate the delivery of measurements to sink nodes or gateway. The implementation
    of WSN depends on the nature of the farming envitonment and communication requirements.
    For instace, ZigBee and LoRa are frequently employed WSN in outdoor areas due
    to their lower cost, low energy consumption, and good transmission range [3].
    Bluetooth communication is widely used in indoor farms due to its limited transmission
    range [4]. RFID and NFC communication technologies are used in monitor assets
    in agricultural supply chain [5]. Apart from that, WiFi is not common for WSN
    due to its high costs and high energy usage; thereby does not holds much promise
    for agricultural uses [3]. Smart farming has the potential to revolutionize agriculture,
    but the lack of low-cost reliable and fast connectivity is limiting its potential.
    A high-speed network, such as 5G, is essential for precision farming. By offering
    faster data transmission and supporting various applications, including Massive
    IoT, 5G networks can enhance WSN performance [6]. 5G technology can provide the
    high-speed, low-latency connectivity necessary to support smart farming and enable
    the widespread adoption of precision agriculture techniques. Fig. 1 shows 5G Network
    as a communication infrastructure for various process in precision agriculture.
    For instance, 5G Networks can provide connectivity to remote and rural areas,
    allowing farmers to access the technology and services. Moreover, 5G also support
    the deployment of autonomous vehicles, enabling farmers to optimize their operations
    and reduce costs. This study aims to investigate the potential challenges of and
    potential solutions for harnessing 5G Networks for smart farming. The 5G mobile
    network employs a high-band spectrum to provide very high speed and minimal latency.
    Because of its higher bandwidth, 5G can link billions of devices in addition to
    high data capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. In terms of downloading and
    uploading speeds, 5G will outperform existing 4G and 4G LTE standards by up to
    100 times. 5G can connect 1 million devices per square kilometre and is also enabled
    when devices travel at very high speeds (around 500 kmph). Another significant
    advantage of 5G is the ability to deliver latency as low as 1 ms, which eliminates
    the lagging connection issues that present in today’s network generation. Microwaves
    (MWs) cannot cover vast areas because they are used as carriers in the 5G network.
    The smallcell concept is introduced to provide seamless connectivity, in which
    small base stations are put approximately 250 m apart throughout coverage areas
    and can be expanded to any extent. To connect the bigger extents, the associated
    small towers can be placed anywhere (lamp posts, trees, roofs, car tops, etc.).
    Figure 4 shows how the 5G network is deployed in rural and urban areas, which
    may span any range. Benefits of using 5G are High capacity, Decreased latency,
    High connection density, High throughput, Improved spectral efficiency, Seamless
    connectivity, Wide coverage, Increased network energy efficiency. According to
    the ITU, the most recent 5G possibilities fall into three categories: enhanced
    mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultrareliable
    low latency communications (URLLC) [8]. In the case of eMBB, the primary goal
    is humancentric interaction performance metrics such as total user experience,
    whereas in the case of mMTC, the primary goals are high connection density, minimal
    battery consumption, low cost, and complexity. mMTC specialises in building and
    facility administration, logistics, smart/precision agriculture, fleet management,
    and other areas. Fig. 1. 5G Network as a communication infrastructure for precision
    agriculture [7] Show All A. 5G in Agriculture Sector The current state of 5G application
    necessitates a description of the agricultural ecosystem, which has yet to see
    large-scale, commercial application due to the number of operational 5G networks
    that are still in construction. The development of communication network technology
    is primarily pushed by major mobile operators and micro-electronics companies
    in large-scale pilots such as IoF2020 [9]. However, they prioritise current technologies
    (e.g., 3G/4G) and particular IoT protocols (e.g., LoRaWAN, SigFox, NB-IoT) because
    they anticipate a return on investment. Small and medium-sized mobile operators
    are also interested in 5G, and they are not constrained by the need for a return
    on investment in existing technologies such as 3G and 4G. This could allow them
    to completely invest in 5G, while established companies will launch new business
    models in densely populated areas. They will first use existing technologies in
    rural areas with reduced population density. Because the proportion of rural regions
    that may have 5G coverage is expected to remain small, the potential market for
    global agricultural manufacturers to engage in costly 5G development is insufficient.
    Another component of the agrifood ecosystem is the general growth of AgTech, which
    is just getting started. According to AgFunder, the world’s agrifood tech start-ups
    raised a total of 26.1billionin2020,upfrom 19.8 billion in 2019 in 1858 deals
    and 2344 distinct investors, up from $2.9 billion in 2012. SECTION II. Challenges
    of using 5G Networks in Precision Agriculture A. Network Connectivity 5G technology
    in agriculture must address the lack of reliable network coverage and high-speed
    internet in many rural locations, which can severely hamper the efficiency and
    dependability of the technology. Poor connectivity can restrict farmers’ access
    to current information, which can have a big impact on crop yields, soil quality,
    and water usage. Additionally, data transfer may be interrupted or delayed, leading
    to erroneous data and inefficient technology use. Weak signals and limited access
    to data and services can also make it challenging to integrate 5G technology.
    B. Cost and Scalability The costs associated with the adoption of smart technologies
    and systems are the main impediment to the agricultural sector’s digitization.
    5G technology adoption in agriculture faces a number of challenges, such as the
    high cost of equipment, hardware installation, subscription to centralised networks
    and software packages, and periodic maintenance. Environmental, ethical, and social
    costs may also be linked with the deployment of smart systems. Most farms are
    located in sparsely populated regions. 5G can address scalability challenges by
    supporting a wide array of use cases and devices. Low-bandwidth wireless connectivity
    is suitable for rural areas, while high-speed connectivity is crucial for vertical
    farming. By leveraging data collected from IoT-enabled remote sensors, 5G-enabled
    precision farming enables farmers to effectively manage pests and diseases, as
    well as address climate change-related challenges. Network Scalability and comprehensive
    coverage require deploying a big number of WSN nodes and 5G base stations. Managing
    the scalability of these networks becomes a significant challenge which involves
    designing a hierarchical or mesh network architecture that allows for seamless
    expansion, scalability, and effective management of network resources. Achieving
    comprehensive coverage also demands synchronization between WSN nodes and 5G base
    stations. Time synchronization for various applications, includes coordinated
    data collection, event detection, and resource allocation. Synchronization protocols
    and techniques are needed to ensure accurate and synchronized operation across
    the network. C. Data Management Despite the potential benefits of 5G technology
    for agriculture, one obstacle to implementation is data management. The increasing
    volume, speed, and variety of data produced by 5G technology present significant
    problems for data management. In order to facilitate quick decision-making, the
    deployment of sensors and IoT devices, for instance, can result in substantial
    data volumes that must be processed and analyzed in real-time. A few examples
    of the types of data produced by 5G technology in agriculture are crop data, weather
    data, soil data, and operational data. One of the primary problems with data management
    in the implementation of 5G in agriculture is data integration. Among the data
    sources used by 5G technology in agriculture are sensors, IoT devices, drones,
    and autonomous vehicles. Data integration and analysis can be difficult due to
    the richness and diversity of the data, and data security and privacy must be
    guaranteed to avoid unauthorized access and data breaches. To enable smooth data
    administration and analysis, standardizing data formats and ensuring compatibility
    between various data sources are crucial. SECTION III. Apotential 5G-enabled Solutions
    for Precision Agriculture A. Use of Drones/UAV in Farming UAVs/drones are becoming
    increasingly popular in the agriculture sector, allowing farms and companies to
    increase crop yields, save time, and make land management decisions. They can
    perform both airborne and ground-based missions, and have different sensors for
    different purposes. Drones with multispectral imaging, thermal infrared imaging,
    hyperspectral, and lidar sensors are used to scan a large area for 3D mapping;
    counting plants; computing vegetation indices such as NDVI, CCCI, NDRE, MCARI,
    and CWSI; and capturing plant health, soil temperature, and water levels. Agricultural
    drones are typically used for low-altitude operations (below 120 m) and use a
    specific radio connection or Wi-Fi; as a result, they have a very restricted range
    of 3-7 km with a big transmitting antenna. With 5G technology, farmers can fly
    a drone over a large distance either manually or through programmed checkpoints,
    and technically, the drone can be controlled from anywhere in the world [10].
    The 5G cellular network enables farmers to receive real-time data from drones,
    such as high-definition video streams, as well as other critical sensory data
    and telemetry, quicker and more seamlessly than previous-generation mobile networks.
    Drones do not need a lot of computing power, and all data can be sent to the cloud
    for faster processing. Multiple drones can communicate with one another to provide
    synchronized autonomous flight over a geographical region and perform multiple
    tasks with minimal data transmission loss and energy consumption, allowing for
    extended airborne sensing time and cost-effective operation beyond the line of
    sight. Table I reviews some of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural
    operations. Most of the systems are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. TABLE I Different UAV based systems for Agriculture [5]
    B. Real time Monitoring Wireless sensors connected to the internet can measure
    environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, luminosity, and soil moisture,
    allowing automated corrective action to be taken to maintain normal plant growth
    conditions. Agricultural data can be in various formats and requires compatibility
    with the relevant interfaces. Figure 5 shows an illustration of these sensors
    for real-time tracking. To monitor various farming parameters, Software programmes
    such as SmartElement, Pycno, Power BI, and Tableau are used to monitor farming
    parameters, while open-source platforms such as Thingsboard and Openfarm provide
    data gathering, visualization, device management, and other functions. A 5G cellular
    network can connect a massive number of sensors (1 million devices per square
    kilometer) to a single cellular tower, allowing farmers to install more IoT sensors
    to perform more tasks more efficiently. These sensors benefit from the minimal
    power transmission and reliability of 5G technology, allowing them to transmit
    data at reduced energy levels and avoid data re-transmission, increasing their
    lifetime. C. AI driven Robots AI and 5G technology enable live video monitoring,
    remote diagnostics, and on-site prescription, as well as stabilization of drones
    and robots by precisely controlling their parameters. AI in agriculture is expected
    to increase at a 25.5% CAGR between 2020 and 2026. (AI in Agriculture Market by
    Technology, 2020). Farming industries have started adopting robotic techniques
    to make farms autonomous saving labour costs and increasing efficiency of their
    farmlands, these autonomous robots use various navigation tools, image processing
    techniques and real-time control of physical extensions, these demands can be
    catered using 5G and Software defined networking(SDN) based edge computing [11].
    In recent years, agricultural robots have been used to plant various crop varieties
    autonomously across several acres of ground. AI powered robots are used to precisely
    identify and eliminate weeds across a given area without harming crops. The different
    kinds of AI powered robots are displayed in Figure 7. An example of this is an
    autonomous potato weed control project leveraging 5G , which uses cameras on a
    vehicle and a deep learning algorithm on an on-board computer. The detection is
    a time-consuming and data-intensive process that requires expensive hardware.
    Offloading these operations to a nearby infrastructure (cloud computing) lowers
    expenses and energy consumption of electric drive robots, allowing them to operate
    for longer periods of time in the field.. You can see the robot by Agrointelli
    in Figure 6. Fig. 2. General 5G and Iot Architecture [7] Show All An outdoor demonstration
    with pre-5G connectivity worked well. More than 90% of the volunteer potato was
    properly detected and sprayed, while only 5% of the primary crop sugar beet was
    incorrectly sprayed. The results obtained were an uplink bandwidth of 120 Mbps
    and a latency of 25 ms (upload pictures, processing images, and getting plant
    locations) [12]. D. Energy-saving Techniques The scarcity and high cost of energy
    in agricultural and rural sectors necessitate the use of energy-efficient devices,
    such as low-power 5G gadgets. These devices not only reduce energy use but also
    enhance dependability, since they are less prone to power outages. Additionally,
    5G-powered wireless sensor network (WSN) sensors consume minimal energy, enabling
    them to operate for extended periods without recharging. This approach significantly
    minimizes the need for costly repairs in remote locations. Energy-saving techniques
    like Beamforming can further optimize energy use by reducing the number of base
    stations needed in rural areas. This technology bolsters signal strength and diminishes
    interference. Utilizing a generalized version of the Lloyd algorithm, it was demonstrated
    that Beamforming could maintain a quality of service of 50Mbps for 95% of users
    during peak hours [14], thus lessening the requirement for additional base stations.
    This strategic decrease in base stations reduces not only the costs associated
    with their installation but also energy consumption and waste, contributing to
    an environmentally sustainable model by lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Considerations
    must include power usage, the feasibility of energy harvesting techniques, and
    the availability of power sources in the target area. Focusing on battery life
    optimization, the incorporation of renewable energy sources, and effective power
    distribution is crucial to the success of this endeavor. Fig. 3. General 5G and
    Iot Architecture [13] Show All E. Autonomous Farming 5G provides ultra-low latency
    communication which is critical for real time control and autonomous management
    of farms. 5G-connected robots in a farm can perform actions such as harvesting
    or fertilization applications accurately and efficiently. Another advantage of
    5G is the higher bandwidth due to which a large amount of data which is generated
    by various sensors in the field can be collected and transmitted to edge computing
    which is data being locally processed instead of a centralized cloud server. This
    ensures all data is collected and analyzed in real time. 5G also supports network
    slicing which allows different resources to be allocated to different parts of
    the network based on the specific requirements of each application. This can help
    ensure that the autonomous vertical farm’s control systems have the necessary
    resources to operate properly. Overall almost all the basic advantages of 5G like
    low latency, high bandwidth and network slicing helps IoT enabled farms immensely,
    reducing costs and increasing yield. A study from ONFarm found that farms aided
    by IoT enabled devices had almost 1.75% increase in yield and energy saving of
    almost 17-32 dollars per hectors, additionally water used for irrigation also
    was reduced by 8% [15]. This shows a significant amount of reduction in resources
    used and increase in profitability. F. Faster and Reliable Communication 5G networks
    are essential for real-time monitoring and precision management of agricultural
    systems. They can provide extremely low latency communications, allowing farmers
    to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other variables and make immediate
    adjustments to irrigation, fertilizer application, and other inputs. Additionally,
    5G networks can provide high bandwidth, allowing for the transfer of large amounts
    of data generated by precision agriculture systems. This data can be analyzed
    in real-time to provide accurate and timely insights into crop health, soil conditions,
    and other factors that affect crop growth and yield. 5G networks also support
    the use of predictive analytics, which can be used to forecast crop yields, identify
    potential crop diseases or pests, and optimize resource allocation based on anticipated
    demand. This can help reduce waste, improve sustainability, and increase profitability
    [16]. Drones and other connected devices can use LEO satellite allowing crucial
    data to be analyzed quickly. Integrating satellites with 5G infrastructure improves
    the Quality of Experience (QoE) of high capacity applications. Drones with NDVI
    sensors may gather information on the health and development of plants, and 5G
    networks can be used to send that information to computers for analysis. By enabling
    edge computing, 5G can also aid NDVI. In order to use edge computing, data must
    be processed locally, near to the point of collection, rather than being sent
    to a central server for analysis. Edge computing enables in-the-moment analysis
    of NDVI data, giving quick insights into the health and development of plants.
    This is especially helpful in precision farming, where quick action may be required
    to increase yields and decrease waste. Precision agriculture typically covers
    vast areas, and thus ensuring reliable network coverage in all parts of the agricultural
    fields is a game-changer. One of the primary determinants for the optimal placement
    of WSN nodes and 5G base stations involves geographical constraints, signal propagation
    characteristics, obstacles, and coverage requirements. Strategic planning should
    involve careful site surveys, predictive modelling, and simulation tools to identify
    suitable locations for deployment. Coexistence between WSN nodes and 5G base stations
    introduces interference issues as both systems operate in the same frequency range.
    Careful planning mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication. Techniques
    like frequency planning, power control, and spatial separation are employed to
    manage interference effectively. SECTION IV. Case Study:Deep learning-base Classification
    of Fruits Early plant disease detection is economically vital. Computer vision
    and machine learning technologies can detect and treat infections early, reducing
    disease spread and increasing cure rates. Over 374 million fruits are harvested
    annually; in 2011, 50–55% of these were grown in Asia [17]. Fruit appearance influences
    customer choices and varies depending on the place of sale. (hawkers, shop, malls,
    etc.). Most fruits are packaged by hand, which reduces quality and increases labour
    costs. Given the enormous increase in fruit production, an accurate classification
    method is vital; manpower demands must be reduced and efficiency increased [4].
    Machine-learning approaches are replacing traditional methods of fruit classification,
    such as gas sensors, infrared imaging, and liquid chromatography, which require
    skilled operators and costly equipment. Fruit classification based on images requires
    only a digital camera and an efficient model. The neural network (NN)-based artificial
    bee colony (ABC) algorithm was used to classify four types of fruits, with an
    accuracy of 76.39% [18]. A hybrid technique using an enhanced fitness-scaled chaotic
    ABC, feedforward NNs, and an optimized genetic algorithm had an accuracy of 87.9%
    [19]. Two-step classification extracted shape, color, and texture data that were
    fed to a fast NN trained by a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm.
    Principal component analysis (PCA) had a classification accuracy of 89.11% when
    applied to 18 different fruits [19]. Fruit Classification Framework have infrastructure,
    resource engine, and data engine layers. A device sublayer, a \"local edge cache
    unit,\" MEC orchestrators, and RANs are all part of the infrastructure layer.
    MECs and RANs distribute resources to end consumers. The resource engine layer
    optimises network resources for efficient transmission. For optimization, self-organizing
    networks (SONs), network function virtualization (NFV), and software-defined networks
    (SDNs) are used. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods can be used
    to preprocess data, extract features, and categorise objects. The overall structure
    of our model is illustrated in figure 8 Fig. 4. General 5G and Iot Architecture
    [19] Show All Mobile phones with cameras record images or video frames, which
    are saved locally and then transferred via 5G to the local edge cache unit. The
    layer of the resource engine optimizes resources by learning about network factors
    such as communication quality, data flow, and network type. When large amounts
    of data must be transferred but bandwidth is limited, this is crucial for green
    communication. The resource engine layer has an impact on 5G reliability, scalability,
    and adaptability as well. The data engine layer transfers images to data centres
    using 5G technology and has a hybrid DL design for identifying and classifying
    fruits the pretrained VGG19 model and the pyramid histogram of oriented gradient
    (PHOG) feature extraction method are used in the architecture. A flow chart of
    the fruit classification process is shown in figure 9. This hybrid classification
    technique uses 5G and cloud technology to classify fruits by combining a DCNN
    model with PHOG features. This effort to combine DCNN and PHOG features for fruit
    classification using 5G technology and the Internet of Things performed significantly
    better than presently available classifiers. Fig. 5. General 5G and Iot Architecture
    [19] Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Agriculture is one of the most important industries
    that could benefit from 5G networks, but the use of 5G in agriculture is in its
    early stages. To make things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, the
    issues raised in Section 6 must be resolved. Government efforts, grants and endowments,
    public-private partnerships, data openness, and regional research work can help
    in dealing with possible challenges. Advances in AI, analytics, and connected
    sensors technologies can help increase yields, improve efficiency, and build sustainability
    and resilience in precision agriculture [20]. The global precision farming market
    is expected to expand at a significant rate, reaching a value of USD 17,110.46
    million by 2028 [21]. As world’s population is increasing precision agriculture
    can help meet the growing demand for food while preserving resources, while 5G
    can help overcome labour shortages. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    are edible young plants that have recently attracted interest because of their
    color and flavor diversity, phytonutrient abundance, short growth cycle, and minimal
    space and nutrient requirements. They can be cultivated in a variety of systems
    from simple home gardens to sophisticated vertical farms with automated irrigation,
    fertilizer delivery, and lighting controls. Microgreens have also attracted attention
    from space agencies hoping that their sensory qualities can contribute to the
    diet of astronauts in microgravity and their cultivation might help maintain crew
    physical and psychological health on long-duration spaceflight missions. However,
    many technical challenges and data gaps for growing microgreensboth on and off
    Earth remain unaddressed. This review summarizes recent studies on multiple aspects
    of microgreens, including nutritional and socioeconomic benefits, cultivation
    systems, operative conditions, innovative treatments, autonomous facilities, and
    potential space applications. It also provides the authors’ perspectives on the
    challenges to stimulating more extensive interdisciplinary research. Keywords

    plants that are harvested at full cotyledon expansion and emergence of true leaves
    (Xiao et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2020), have recently gained increasing popularity.
    These seedlings exhibit advantages over mature plants given their short growth
    cycle and attractive colors and flavors, etc. Moreover, microgreens are rich in
    phytonutrients with highly species-dependent nutrient profiles (Mir et al. 2017,
    Teng et al. 2021, Turner et al. 2020, Xiao et al. 2012). Microgreens can be produced
    by procedures with all levels of sophistication, ranging from at-home cultivation
    on potting mix or capillary mat (Işık et al. 2020, Kyriacou et al. 2020, Wieth
    et al. 2020) to mass production with state-of-the-art controlled environment agriculture
    (CEA) technologies (Guntaka et al. 2021, Jiang et al. 2021, Rankothge et al. 2021).
    The multitude of benefits of microgreens has incited extensive studies and technological
    advancement, a trend that has accelerated in the 2020s. Several underutilized
    species and cultivars have been investigated for their nutritional composition
    and health benefits (Altuner et al. 2021, Lenzi et al. 2019, Schayot 2021, Senevirathne
    et al. 2019). Several comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies (de la Fuente
    et al. 2020, Mohamed et al. 2022, Truzzi et al. 2021) yielded more insight at
    the level of molecular nutrition. Continuous efforts have been made to optimize
    the growth conditions with a focus on light input (Appolloni et al. 2022) and
    nutrient management (Islam et al. 2020, Patras 2021, Phornvillay et al. 2022).
    Moreover, microgreen production has benefited from a variety of emerging cultivation
    systems (Kizak & Kapaligoz 2019, Ma et al. 2019), innovative treatments (Phornvillay
    et al. 2022, Saengha et al. 2021, Supapvanich et al. 2020), and the revolutionary
    Internet of Things (IoT) (Guntaka et al. 2021, Jiang et al. 2021, Turchenko et
    al. 2020). Beyond the Earth, microgreens have been considered as a possible diet
    component for crew members in the space station(s). The rich flavor and unique
    nutrient profile of microgreens may help promote appetite and maintain the homeostasis
    of astronauts (Cahill & Hardiman 2020, Taylor et al. 2020). In addition, the convenient
    cultivation and vibrant color make microgreens a good choice for horticultural
    therapy (Kyriacou et al. 2017). Although space farming faces many challenges from
    the microgravitational environment (Hirai & Kitaya 2009, Kitaya et al. 2010),
    various technologies and growth systems are being developed or conceptualized
    to achieve successful space cultivation (Chandrika et al. 2019, Kalossaka et al.
    2021, Rai & Kaur 2012, Xu et al. 2020). This review aims to summarize the latest
    research and development on multiple aspects of microgreens, including the nutritional
    and socioeconomic aspects, cultivation systems and techniques, critical growth
    conditions, quality and safety improvement technologies, IoT and autonomous gardening,
    and the potential of microgreen space farming. It also provides the authors’ perspectives
    on the trends and research opportunities in this area with the intent to stimulate
    more comprehensive and interdisciplinary research. The fact that most of the references
    covered in this review were published in the 2020s signifies the increasing interest
    and momentum in microgreen-related research. 1.1.   Nutritional Profile of Microgreens
    Microgreens are densely packed with nutrients and health-promoting phytochemicals.
    The past four years (2019–2022) have seen a surge in research on the nutritional
    aspects of microgreens. Two subjects are highlighted in these recent studies:
    (a) the nutritional composition of uncommon or underutilized microgreen species
    and (b) mechanistic investigations via in vitro and in vivo studies. Readers are
    referred to review articles for studies published prior to 2019 (see Mir et al.
    2017, Teng et al. 2021, Turner et al. 2020). 1.1.1.   Nutritional composition.
    Table 1 summarizes recent studies regarding the nutritional composition and antioxidative
    activities of microgreens. Many microgreen species are excellent sources of essential
    nutrients (amino acids, vitamins, minerals, etc.) as well as nonessential, health-beneficial
    phytonutrients (mainly phenolics and glucosinolates). Whether microgreens or their
    mature counterparts provide more nutrients depends on the species and the type
    of nutrients. For instance, parsley microgreens have more phosphorous and potassium
    but less calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and sodium than baby greens (El-Nakhel et
    al. 2021a). For vitamins, fenugreek and roselle microgreens have higher α-tocopherol
    but lower β-carotene levels than mature plants (Ghoora et al. 2020b). In addition,
    certain microgreen species exhibit high levels of nitrate (Lenzi et al. 2019)
    or an inadequate nitrogen balance index (Altuner et al. 2021). Regarding the phytonutrients,
    although lettuce (Martínez-Ispizua et al. 2022) microgreens exhibit higher total
    phenolic content (TPC) than mature plants, Chinese basil (Dimita et al. 2022),
    radish, jute, and water spinach (Yadav et al. 2019) show greater TPC at maturity.
    Moreover, as discussed in Section 3, the nutritional profile of microgreens is
    greatly influenced by the growth environment and nutrient input. As such, the
    comparison between microgreens and mature plants should be conducted under reasonably
    similar growth conditions. Considering all these factors, it is recommended that
    microgreen species be investigated discriminatively for their nutritional properties
    and included in nutritionally balanced meals to realize maximal nutritional benefits.

    There have been several recent studies on the antiproliferative effect of microgreens
    and their underlying mechanisms ( Table 2 ). In vitro studies revealed remarkable
    and selective inhibition against cancer cells by broccoli, kale, mustard, radish,
    green pea, soybean, barley, beetroot, and amaranth microgreens (de la Fuente et
    al. 2020, Truzzi et al. 2021). Studies show that the antiproliferative effects
    of microgreens may be attributed to two factors. First, microgreens in general
    are an abundant source of antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, as well
    as phenolics. Those compounds scavenge excessive ROS (reactive oxygen species)
    and help maintain normal signaling, thus preventing cell damage induced by cancer
    cells (do Carmo et al. 2018). Second, it has been found that certain polyphenols
    such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), trans-resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin
    may act as pro-oxidants. Those compounds produce hydrogen peroxide and kill cancer
    cells without significantly damaging normal tissues (D''Angelo et al. 2017, León-González
    et al. 2015). Recently, two comparative studies (Drozdowska et al. 2020, 2021)
    reported more potent antiproliferative effects of red-headed cabbage microgreens
    than mature plants. The authors attributed the difference to the greater levels
    of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids in microgreens. However, more
    studies are needed to conclude whether microgreens in general exhibit greater
    antiproliferative effects than their mature counterparts. In addition, knowledge
    gaps remain as to which role of the phenolics is predominant under given conditions
    and in certain pathways. Table 2 Recent studies on the antiproliferative and antidiabetic

    this is not a strict pairwise comparison between microgreens and sprouts of same

    Abbreviations: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; BuChE, butylcholinesterase; GSH, glutathione;

    species. More recently, barley (Mohamed et al. 2022) and broccoli (S. Ma et al.
    2022, Theodorou et al. 2021) microgreens have been reported to exhibit significant
    antidiabetic effects. Such an effect is achieved by broccoli microgreens through
    blood lipid status improvement, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions, insulin
    sensitization, and modulation of gut microbiota. The effect observed in barley
    is attributed to two compounds, wistin (4′,6-dimethoxyisoflavone-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside)
    and phytanic acid. Both compounds activate proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-α
    and PPAR-γ subunits), which are major regulators of adipocyte differentiation
    and glucose metabolism (Roca-Saavedra et al. 2017, Sanada et al. 2016). Wistin
    has not been reported as indigenous to mature barley plants or grains, which suggests
    different antidiabetic mechanisms for mature and microgreen barleys (Zeng et al.
    2020). Similar to the case of antiproliferative effects, there is limited research
    on the comparison between the antidiabetic functions of microgreens, baby leaves,
    sprouts, mature plants, and mature edible parts (e.g., grains) (Wojdyło et al.
    2020). Further research is recommended to address this knowledge gap. 1.2.   Role
    in Physical and Mental Well-Being The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused not
    only psychological stress but also a general reduction in daily physical activities.
    Gardening is a cost-effective activity that enhances a feeling of connectedness
    with nature and addresses the problem of a sedentary lifestyle (Theodorou et al.
    2021). Growing microgreens has emerged as a favored home gardening activity. The
    convenient growth procedure, short growth cycle, vibrant color, and rich flavor
    make microgreens an excellent choice for first-time home gardeners, who may be
    more hesitant to try growing mature plants because of the complexity of maintenance
    and potential failure. Microgreens’ positive effects on physical and mental health
    are demonstrated in two studies in the United Kingdom (Gittins & Morland 2021)
    and United States (Kelley et al. 2017), respectively, which suggested that participants
    experienced less depression and better physical health by growing microgreens,
    and they would continue to grow plants as a hobby. 1.3.   Role in Food Security
    Food insecurity is a growing concern as the world urbanizes. Microgreens may be
    a suitable addition to urban farms that improves food security owing to their
    ability to provide households with a timely supply of nutrients in the case of
    emergency (Di Gioia et al. 2017). Moreover, the minimal space requirement and
    relatively high price make microgreens a profitable choice for CEA and urban/vertical
    farms, which allow year-round production under various climatic conditions. Those
    advantages have made microgreens a main food product in global urban farming according
    to a recent survey (Armanda et al. 2019). Furthermore, microgreens have proven
    to be a great educational tool for improving nutrition awareness (Haslund-Gourley
    et al. 2022) and stimulating indoor food farming practices in local communities
    (Herrmann et al. 2020). However, it is worth noting that microgreen production
    requires a large volume of seeds with relatively low biomass yield per seed in
    comparison to mature plants.  2.  MAIN AND EMERGING CULTIVATION SYSTEMS FOR MICROGREENS  Microgreens
    have been grown in various systems with diverse levels of precision and sophistication.
    Many of these systems are discussed in this section and can be used in CEA facilities
    that allow precise climate, nutrient, and light control in all locations and seasons.
    Compared to conventional open farm production, CEA enables energy-efficient and
    year-round production of crops with greater and more consistent yield, nutritional
    value, quality, and safety (Shamshiri et al. 2018). 2.1.   Soilless Substrate–Based
    Farming Soilless substrate–based farming is the most convenient growth method
    for noncommercial settings such as home gardening. These systems leverage soilless
    substrates such as peat moss, coconut coir, hemp mat, rockwool, or other inert
    porous materials (Di Gioia et al. 2017, Thuong & Minh 2020) and deliver water
    via either top-down dripping/spraying or bottom-up wicking. A common analogy is
    made between this approach and the hydroponic cultivation of mature crops. However,
    microgreen cultivation is unique in that the nutrient solution is optional rather
    than required (El-Nakhel et al. 2021b), and thus the substrates may function as
    a nutrient source rather than merely an inert support (Thuong & Minh 2020). To
    date, various user-friendly growth kits have been developed based on soilless
    substrates and gained popularity among home gardeners. One example is the Microgreen
    Growth Kit™ by Hamama ( Figure 1 ), which consists of a pre-seeded mat and a coconut
    coir substrate. This system only requires laying the seeded mat on the substrate
    and watering once. Microgreens can grow with an adequate level of water supply
    and be harvested typically in two weeks. Another example is the Cell One™, which
    is an enclosed system with pre-seeded pods and LED illumination. A user-friendly
    mobile application allows users to monitor the water level and adjust lighting
    conditions. Figure 1 A home-friendly microgreen growth kit. (a) A proprietary
    germination mat with seeded pockets. (b) Placing the germination mat after one-time
    watering. (c) Seedlings emerging from the pockets. (d) Harvesting the microgreens.

    Systems Hydroponic techniques such as deep-water culture (DWC) and nutrient film
    technique (NFT) feature higher water efficiency at the expense of higher instrument/energy/space
    costs. In DWC systems, seeds are sown on an inert substrate floating on a deep
    reservoir of circulated water or nutrient solution, where the roots develop to
    seek nourishment. DWC systems require active aeration of the reservoir. A recent
    study reported that proper aeration improved the productivity of lentil and wheat
    microgreens, while insufficient aeration led to root hypoxia and poor growth (Grishin
    et al. 2021). On the other hand, excessive agitation and aeration were found to
    cause root damage and reduced yield for Swiss chard (Baiyin et al. 2021). NFT
    systems deliver the nutrient solution continuously as a shallow, recirculating
    stream through an inclined growth tray. NFT is advantageous due to minimal root
    submersion, which boosts root zone aeration and benefits plant development. However,
    it is susceptible to pump failure, which leads to rapid root dehydration. Recently,
    NFT has been reported to provide significantly improved yield of table beet microgreens
    compared to substrate-based methods (Murphy et al. 2010). Moreover, home-friendly
    NFT systems such as Grow Wall™ are available for household cultivation of microgreens
    and mature plants. 2.3.   Aeroponic Systems Aeroponic methods deliver the nutrient
    solution via fine aerosol droplets (10–100 μm) through various atomization techniques
    (Eldridge et al. 2020). These minute droplets offer two major advantages, namely
    the highest water efficiency among all growth methods and excellent root zone
    oxygenation. However, aeroponic systems require sophisticated instrumentation
    for precise environmental control and are vulnerable to power outages or suboptimal
    nutrient recipes. Aeroponic techniques have been adopted for commercial microgreen
    production in emerging corporations such as AeroFarms ( Figure 2 ). Miniaturized
    aeroponic microgreen growth towers (Agrotonomy 2019) and prototype root chambers
    (Gnauer et al. 2019) have also been reported. Figure 2 Microgreens produced by
    aeroponic technology. (a) Seedlings growing on a proprietary fabric suitable for
    aeroponic operation. (b) A final product containing several varieties of microgreens.
    Photos courtesy of AeroFarms, Inc.   Click to view Download as PowerPoint   2.4.   Aquaponic
    Systems Aquaponic systems feature the simultaneous cultivation of fish (aquaculture)
    and plants (hydroponics). They leverage the conversion of fish waste to plant
    nourishment via naturally occurring microbes (Yep & Zheng 2019), followed by remediation
    and recirculation of water consumed by plants. This system is highly water/nutrient
    efficient and improves plant growth via its unique dissolved organic matter and
    microbiota (Nicoletto et al. 2018). However, it requires constant monitoring and
    adjustment of nutrient composition due to the mismatch between the nutrient requirements
    of fish, nitrifying bacteria, and plants (Nicoletto et al. 2018). Currently, there
    is only one academic publication on aquaponic production of arugula microgreens
    (Kizak & Kapaligoz 2019). However, it is foreseeable that this technology could
    gain more attention in the future and become a sustainable, visually appealing,
    and economically viable method for producing microgreens or other miniaturized
    plants.  3.  KEY FACTORS AFFECTING MICROGREEN GROWTH  The growth and quality of
    microgreens can be influenced by many environmental and operational factors, including
    substrate, light, and nutrient input. These factors need to be considered and
    optimized on a species-specific basis to achieve optimal yield and product quality,
    as is discussed in this section. 3.1.   Substrates Substrates can serve as a nutrient
    source and/or as an interface between plants and the nutrient solution. Thus,
    substrates may affect microgreen growth by physical (mechanical strength and support,
    water holding/wicking capacity, air-filled porosity, etc.), chemical (dissolution
    of nutrients and/or antinutrients from substrate), or microbiological (initial
    microbial load or susceptibility to microbial growth) means. Table 3 summarizes
    recent studies comparing the performance of various microgreen growth substrates.
    These results suggest that the performance of a substrate is dependent on the
    species and the goals (fresh yield, dry yield, nutrient level, etc.). In addition,
    it is noteworthy that all those studies employed similar fertilizers or nutrient
    solutions, and thus the different performances of the substrates were more attributable
    to their physical property than chemical composition. The role of chemical composition
    would have been more remarkable if the microgreens had been cultivated in pure
    water or under nutrient deprivation (see Section 3.3). Moreover, factors such
    as cost, durability, ease of disinfection, and biodegradability need to be considered.
    Overall, it is recommended that proper substrates be chosen on a case-specific
    basis. Table 3 Recent studies on the effect of substrates on microgreen growth

    Light as the energy source for plant growth is the core parameter controlled by
    CEA as well as the factor most extensively studied for microgreen production (Alrifai
    et al. 2019, Appolloni et al. 2022, Zhang et al. 2020). In brief, the light spectrum
    affects yield and the contents and profile of secondary metabolites (glucosinolates,
    phenolics, etc.) in a highly species-dependent manner (Alrifai et al. 2020). The
    photoperiod interacts with the circadian rhythm of plants, regulates nutrient
    uptake and growth, and alters the production of secondary metabolites (Liu et
    al. 2022). The blockage and subsequent exposure to light cause physiological and
    biochemical changes referred to as etiolation and de-etiolation, respectively;
    modulation of such processes by manipulating the timing of first light exposure
    alters the yield, hypocotyl length, and levels of certain nutrients of microgreens
    (Kong & Zheng 2021, Niroula et al. 2021). Overnight supplementation of blue light
    may improve microgreen yield without compromising the nutritional values (Ying
    et al. 2020). Finally, short-term high-intensity light irradiation (Shao et al.
    2020) and pulsed LEDs (Miliauskienė et al. 2021, Olvera-Gonzalez et al. 2021)
    have been reported as effective ways to save energy and induce higher antioxidant
    levels in microgreens. 3.3.   Nutrient Management Although microgreens can grow
    without a nutrient solution, their metabolic pathways can be effectively altered
    by the macro- and microelements in the environment. Therefore, nutrient solutions
    are commonly used and modified in microgreen production, especially under CEA
    settings, to boost crop yield and quality. For example, one-time application of
    a general-purpose fertilizer increases the fresh shoot weight and macro- and micronutrient
    concentrations of ten microgreen species (amaranth, arugula, broccoli, basil,
    cabbage, radish, kale, kohlrabi, mustard, and green pea), despite lower levels
    of minerals that were not present in the fertilizer (T. Li et al. 2021b). In addition,
    the NH4 +/NO3 − ratio in the fertilizer affects the fresh and dry matter, nitrate,
    protein, and β-carotene content of broccoli, broccoli raab, and cauliflower microgreens
    (Palmitessa et al. 2020). Regarding trace nutrients, selenium biofortification
    has been reported as an effective method to enhance the contents of selenium,
    phenolics, flavonoids, vitamin C, and anthocyanin in microgreen species, including
    wheat, coriander, tatsoi, green basil, and red basil (Islam et al. 2020, Pannico
    et al. 2020a). Although sodium is not an essential element for plants, sodium
    salts are employed to induce salinity stress and serve as an elicitor. For instance,
    NaCl (up to 25 mM) significantly increases the levels of β-carotene, phenolic
    acid, flavonoid, vitamin C, anthocyanin, and antioxidant activity of wheat microgreen
    extract without compromising the yield (Islam et al. 2019). Likewise, elevated
    salinity increases the total phenolic content and diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
    scavenging capacity of white cabbage microgreens (Patras 2021) as well as the
    glucosinolate content and antioxidant activity of Brassica carinata (L.) microgreens
    (Maina et al. 2021). Nutrient deprivation has proved to be another effective method
    to regulate microgreen growth. In a recent study, replacing a quarter-strength
    Hoagland nutrient solution with pure water reduced the yield of Brussels sprouts,
    cabbage, and rocket microgreens by 10%, 10%, and 47%, respectively. However, such
    treatment led to remarkably increased levels of lutein, ascorbic acid, phenolic
    acid, and total anthocyanins as well as a reduction of nitrate levels by as much
    as 99% (El-Nakhel et al. 2021b). Very similar results on yield, ascorbic acid,
    phenolics, and nitrate were reported in another study on lettuce microgreens (Pannico
    et al. 2020b). In a third study, lowering the strength of Hoagland nutrient solution
    from 100% to 25% yielded higher anthocyanin content and lower nitrate content
    in garden cress microgreens, but such treatment reduced the carotenoid, total
    phenols, and antioxidant activity levels in radish cress microgreens (Keutgen
    et al. 2021). Finally, nutrient deprivation up to 12 days before harvest reduced
    the nitrate content and improved the phenolic content of lettuce, rocket, and
    mustard microgreens at the expense of lower carotenoid content (Kyriacou et al.
    2021).  4.  TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT EMPOWERING MICROGREEN PRODUCTION  Microgreen
    farming is an epitome of modern agriculture that evolves with greater productivity,
    precision, and level of automation. Such transition is largely propelled by new
    technologies, including advanced physical and chemical treatments as well as IoT-enabled
    autonomous operation. Many of those technologies were invented outside of agricultural
    science but have demonstrated many beneficial effects in microgreen production.
    This section discusses the latest technological advancement in microgreen cultivation
    to highlight and stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration between growers, scientists,
    and engineers. 4.1.   Physical Treatments Physical treatments improve the yield,
    quality, and safety of microgreens by inducing abiotic stress and altering plant
    metabolism. For instance, the advanced oxidation process (AOP) generates highly
    unstable ROS in the presence of UV-C. AOP is augmented by a solvent containing
    micro-nano bubbles (50–100 μm diameter), which generate ROS as the bubbles collapse.
    Combination of the two techniques (AOP and micro-nano bubbles) produced large
    quantities of free radicals that stress the plants and bacteria, which was reported
    to improve seed viability and increase the total phenolic content and DPPH antioxidant
    activity of roselle microgreens (Phornvillay et al. 2022). Cold plasma is a nonthermal,
    economical, flexible, and environmentally friendly procedure for food processing.
    It stresses the plant by oxidative degradation of double bond–containing compounds.
    Cold plasma seed treatment showed significant improvement in the total phenolic,
    isothiocyanate, and flavonoid contents; antioxidant activity; and antiproliferative
    effects for mustard microgreens (Saengha et al. 2021). Similarly, rat-tailed radish
    seeds (Luang-In et al. 2021) treated with a combination of cold plasma and CaCl2
    yielded microgreens with improved dry weight, total isothiocyanate content, and
    total phenolic content. Recently, a multicorona discharge model was developed
    to deliver stable plasma to large microgreen growth areas. The novel design exhibited
    a significant improvement in germination rate of up to 8% and growth rate of up
    to 3.5 times for rat-tailed radish microgreens (Tanakaran & Matra 2021). Pulsed
    electromagnetic field is a noninvasive and ecological method for plant treatment.
    By improving food reserve utilization, nutrient assimilation, enzymatic activity,
    and photosynthesis of plants, this technology was reported to improve the fresh
    weight, dry weight, and greenness of wheat and spinach microgreens (Katsenios
    et al. 2021). Low-frequency high-intensity ultrasound (20–40 kHz) inactivates
    bacterial cells by inducing shear forces, water jets, and shock waves resultant
    from acoustic cavitation in a liquid. A novel technology was developed to leverage
    the bactericidal effect of ultrasound without damaging plant tissues. It combines
    high acoustic power density ultrasound with mild heat and a CaO/Ca(OCl)2 antimicrobial
    spray. This treatment achieved satisfactory antimicrobial effectiveness on radish,
    broccoli, and kale microgreens, which was comparable to that accomplished by immersion
    in a water solution of 20,000 mg/L free chlorine for 20 min. It provides an adequate
    and environmentally friendly solution for mitigating microbial contamination on
    microgreens (Dong et al. 2022). 4.2.   Chemical Treatments A variety of chemical
    treatments have been applied singularly or with physical treatments for improving
    microgreen quality. The chemicals may impact the quality and safety of microgreens
    by (a) serving as elicitors that trigger plant defense response during growth
    or (b) acting as a preservative that extends shelf life after harvest. For preharvest
    applications, CaCl2 combined with UV-B radiation improved the glucosinolate level,
    visual appeal, and shelf life of broccoli microgreens (Lu et al. 2021). A combination
    of Na2SeO3 and UV-A radiation led to significantly improved levels of anthocyanin,
    glucosinolate, total soluble proteins, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant
    activity in broccoli microgreens (Gao et al. 2021). Regarding postharvest treatments,
    immersion of red amaranth microgreens in a solution of cyanocobalamin (vitamin
    B12, 0.1 μM) enhanced the betacyanin, betaxanthin, and total betalain concentrations
    of red amaranth microgreens during storage (Supapvanich et al. 2020). Treatment
    of sunflower microgreens with citric and ascorbic acids improved the phenolic
    content and antioxidant activity while lowering the microbial load at the end
    of storage (Dalal et al. 2020). Finally, aloe vera gel was demonstrated to be
    effective for both pre- and postharvest treatments. Consisting of polysaccharides,
    vitamins, and minerals, the gel led to less electrolyte leakage, higher ascorbic
    acid content, lower microbial load, and better overall acceptability of radish
    and roselle microgreens (Ghoora & Srividya 2020). 4.3.   Autonomous Gardening
    Empowered by the Internet of Things The emergence of the IoT has brought unprecedented
    opportunities for agricultural modernization. IoT-based autonomous growth systems
    collect extensive, real-time data on plant growth and environmental parameters
    (climate, plant size, soil/substrate moisture, nutrient solution status, light
    intensity, photosynthetically active radiation, etc.). These data are utilized
    to inform end users through interactive interfaces and drive autonomous control
    systems to operate functional components (fans, humidifiers, LED panels, robotic
    arms, etc.). These integrated systems minimize the physical intervention by users
    and thus reduce the risk of human error and human-mediated pathogen contamination.
    In addition, by precisely delivering optimal growth conditions at desired times
    and locales, these systems hold promise in improving yield, quality, and energy
    efficiency (Ragaveena et al. 2021). Compared to the broader realm of agriculture,
    microgreen production is still in its early stages of IoT adoption, especially
    on the consumer end. So far, only a few prototypes of IoT-based microgreen sprouting
    systems have been reported ( Table 4 ). These systems are claimed to have multiple
    benefits, including precise climate control, uniform temporal/spatial distribution
    of lighting conditions, energy saving, intuitive operation, and effective inspection
    over large growth areas. It should be noted that the IoT has found much wider
    applications in the production of mature plants, with many more successful designs
    reported since the late 2010s (Sharma et al. 2020). In addition, this technique
    has been adopted by several leading commercial CEA companies (AeroFarms, Bowery
    Farming, Plenty, etc.) for microgreen cultivation. Therefore, it is foreseeable
    that the IoT technology will be applied more widely in microgreen production,
    providing growers with more convenience, better energy efficiency, greater yield,
    and more consistent nutrition quality. Table 4 Internet of Things–enabled autonomous

    MICROGREENS FOR SPACE FARMING  The ability of humans to travel in space on extended
    missions may depend on growing fresh plants in space. NASA (National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration) has been testing growing leafy greens to feed astronauts
    on the International Space Station (Hummerick et al. 2021, Johnson et al. 2021,
    Massa et al. 2016). But growing plants in space faces many technical challenges
    because of the microgravity, limited growth areas and crew time, and elevated
    radiation levels (Johnson et al. 2021). Recently, microgreens have attracted significant
    attention and are being tested by NASA as an alternative or supplement to other
    leafy greens ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Microgreen tests performed by NASA. (Left)

    The unique advantages of microgreens discussed in previous sections make them
    an ideal food ingredient in space. Their short growth period and convenient horticultural
    procedures allow crew members to focus on critical missions and spend minimal
    effort on maintaining the plants. Their relatively low light and water requirements
    are beneficial in a spacecraft environment with limited water and electrical power
    for artificial lighting. In addition, spacecraft and habitats have limited volumes
    and the small size of microgreens would be an asset. Microgreens can be picked
    fresh and are ready-to-eat given proper sanitization measures, and the bold flavor
    and appealing color could enhance food presentation and astronauts’ appetites.
    Lastly, the high density of nutrients and presence of additional bioactive food
    factors may improve crew members’ health and provide adequate antioxidant and
    antiproliferative activities, the latter of which counterbalance the oxidative
    stresses and genotoxicity induced in outer space. The downside of microgreens
    in space farming lies in (a) their inability to produce progenies, leading to
    a large net consumption of seeds, and (b) their low biomass fixation and low oxygen
    generation as compared to growing larger plants (Kyriacou et al. 2017, Wheeler
    et al. 2008). 5.2.   Major Challenges in Space Farming The outer space environment
    is full of challenges not found on Earth. As noted, some challenges are related
    to the limited volume, resources, and crew time during the flight, which can be
    addressed more easily with microgreens than with mature plants. However, growing
    microgreens encounters numerous technical challenges commonly seen with other
    mature leafy greens plus additional unique challenges. First, air convection driven
    by the buoyancy of hot air is lacking under microgravity, which retards the exchange
    of heat, moisture, and gases (e.g., CO2 and ethylene) between plants and the environment,
    sometimes causing metabolic disorders in or damage to plants (Hirai & Kitaya 2009,
    Kitaya et al. 2010). This issue may be addressed by monitoring cabin gas composition
    and applying forced-air convection via electric fans. For fractional gravity environments,
    such as the Moon (1/6 gravity) or Mars (3/8 gravity), the lack of natural convection
    should not be as severe but requires further research. Second, irrigation in space
    environments is extremely difficult, as there is little or no natural drainage
    of the root zone substrates (Jones et al. 2012, Monje et al. 2003), making rooting
    media prone to hypoxia (Porterfield 2002). Various watering solutions for microgravity
    have been tested, including the use of particulate media like arcillite (calcined
    clay chips) with time-released fertilizer and delivery of water with porous tubes
    embedded in the media (Massa et al. 2016, Morrow et al. 1993), use of passive,
    capillary-driven watering as with the NASA Veggie plant chamber (Massa et al.
    2016, Morrow et al. 2017), and proposed aeroponics or hydroponic concepts that
    could contain and recirculate water (Morrow et al. 2017). However, challenges
    remain and watering plants in weightlessness continues to be an area of research
    (Johnson et al. 2021, Monje et al. 2003). For partial gravity settings like the
    Moon and Mars, more conventional watering techniques with solid media and recirculating
    hydroponics should work, but further research is needed (Jones et al. 2012). In
    all cases, considerations for sustainable approaches that minimize consumables
    and generation of wastes and recycling water and nutrients must be considered
    (Vandenbrink et al. 2014). Third, reduced gravity may directly affect the physiology
    of plants and microorganisms (Su et al. 2017, Vandenbrink et al. 2014, Villacampa
    et al. 2021). In general, the observations from plant experiments in space suggest
    that if environmental requirements for light, water, CO2, air circulation, and
    nutrients are met, plant growth is good (Stutte et al. 2005). And numerous studies
    have shown that the growth of plant shoots in space can be oriented phototropically
    (Heathcote et al. 1995, Su et al. 2017). Therefore, providing adequate lighting
    should allow proper shoot orientation, cotyledon opening, and leaf development
    for microgreens even in microgravity.  6.  PERSPECTIVES AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES  As
    discussed in this review, microgreen production has benefited greatly from scientific
    studies and technological advancements. As the microgreen industry is still in
    its early stages of development, there is plentiful room for technological advancement,
    and many knowledge gaps remain to be filled by the scientific community. 6.1.   Holistic
    Nutritional Evaluation As discussed in Section 1.1.1, the nutritional value of
    microgreens needs to be assessed using a holistic approach instead of focusing
    on certain families of compounds. Untargeted metabolomic studies may reveal the
    complex composition of nutrients and antinutrients (Tomas et al. 2021). Moreover,
    as discussed in Section 1.1.2, the overall health benefits and/or specific nutrient
    concentrations of microgreens, baby leaves, sprouts, and mature plants can vary
    largely by plant species, growth stages, and growing conditions. Although many
    studies have documented the overall high nutrient density of microgreens, more
    studies are needed that compare the nutritional profiles of microgreens and mature
    plants of the same species and under similar growth and testing conditions. By
    the same token, expanded studies are also warranted to exploit the opportunities
    of growth environment modulations afforded by CEA to produce the targeted phytonutrients
    in microgreens. 6.2.   Artificial Intelligence As discussed in Section 4.3, autonomous
    microgreen production systems may benefit significantly from cutting-edge technologies,
    especially artificial intelligence (AI), that are proven in the production of
    mature plants. For instance, AI may be used to establish a proper image acquisition
    procedure based on environment and growth stage (Astapova et al. 2022), calculate
    leaf area and estimate the fresh weight at harvest (Nagano et al. 2019), predict
    the yield and nutrition of plants at early stages (Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al.
    2021), and predict optimal timing and position for product harvesting (Krishnan
    & Swarna 2020). In addition, rapid detection platforms may be developed by a matrix
    chromogenic array coupled with AI to detect the early emergence of human/plant
    pathogens (Yang et al. 2021). 6.3.   Nanotechnology Nanomaterials have superior
    capabilities in encapsulating, stabilizing, and delivering small functional molecules.
    Therefore, nanotechnology presents some unique potential in microgreen production
    and broader agriculture. For example, seed coating by nanofibers could not only
    serve as a regulator for moisture and gas exchange but also deliver functional
    compounds (e.g., antimicrobials and plant hormones) with maximal precision and
    efficiency (Chandrika et al. 2019, Xu et al. 2020). Nanoparticles and nanoemulsions
    allow the stabilization and stimulus-responsive release of fertilizer or bioactive
    compounds (Maluin et al. 2021). Hydrogels can be patterned at micro/nanoscale
    precision with the latest 3D-printing technology. This technique, combined with
    novel materials (Tang et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2017) and gelation processes (Cao
    & Li 2021, Wang et al. 2018), may provide an attractive growth substrate with
    desirable physical (particle size, pore size, wettability, air flow, mechanical
    properties, etc.) and chemical (reactivity and interaction with bioactive compounds)
    properties that allow optimal microgreen growth and limit microorganism propagation
    (Kalossaka et al. 2021). 6.4.   Microbial Safety There has been a significant
    knowledge gap in the safety of microgreen products. To date, no outbreaks associated
    with microgreens have been reported. However, there have been a few recalls of
    microgreen products related to human pathogens according to the US Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA 2022) and Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA 2022). These
    events underscore the urgent need for risk analyses that identify sources of contamination
    and critical control points along the farm-to-fork continuum. Lab studies and
    commercial-scale verification are required to establish the route of bacterial
    migration and propagation. Recirculated water and nonsterile substrates are two
    major causes of bacteria propagation (Gombas et al. 2017, Misra 2020); therefore,
    proper water and substrate treatments need to be developed and validated. Microgreens
    are harvested at a few centimeters above the substrate, and their delicate structures
    render them prone to mechanical damage. Both factors may cause substrate-to-product
    bacteria migration (Gombas et al. 2017). Therefore, safe and effective harvesting
    methods could help mitigate pathogenic contamination. Finally, novel antimicrobial
    measures such as biological control may be considered for killing pathogens without
    inducing drug resistance.  7.  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Microgreens are young plants
    with great potential. These versatile, nutrient-dense crops may play a beneficial
    role in the health of consumers, food and nutrient security, and bioregenerative
    support in outer space. The utilization of unconventional species, emerging growth
    platforms, innovative physical and chemical treatments, and the IoT all have had
    a profound influence on the development of the microgreen industry. Holistic nutritional
    evaluation, produce safety, and space farming remain great opportunities for future
    research. Finally, it is envisioned that AI and nanotechnology may greatly enhance
    the productivity, quality, value, and pleasure of microgreen production in the
    future.   disclosure statement  The authors are not aware of any affiliations,

    is edge computing, which provides cloud-like capabilities at the edge of the network
    by pushing storage and processing capabilities from centralized nodes to edge
    devices that are closer to where the data are gathered, resulting in reduced network
    delays [2], [3]. The most common machine learning approach used in cloud-based
    applications is Centralized Learning (Fig. 1a) where datasets from different clients
    are sent to a central cloud for storage and to train a machine learning model.
    A model trained in this centralized manner is potentially the most accurate model
    as it has been trained on all of the datasets. However, centralized training introduces
    challenges associated with transferring data to the cloud, such as data privacy
    and communication overheads. Conversely, Local Learning is an alternative where
    we train the machine learning models directly on the devices where the data are
    hosted using their own local computing resources (Fig. 1b), Since data are not
    shared among clients or with the server, local learning solves the privacy and
    communication overhead issues of centralized learning. However, local learning
    alone can struggle with machine learning bias. This is an emergent problem since
    data at these devices are often non-independent and identically distributed (iid).
    For instance, many data patterns sensors collect are geographically-related. Thus,
    sensors from different locations will likely collect different types of data.
    Learning independently can result in models that do not generalize well which
    can afflict the knowledge extraction across the entire system. A third alternative
    is to apply the recent Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for distributed learning
    (Fig. 1c). FL is a distributed machine learning technique that enables multiple
    clients (e.g., mobile devices, IoT devices) to collaboratively train a shared
    global model without needing their raw data transmitted to the cloud. Instead,
    local models are trained on each client using their own data, similar to local
    learning. Where FL diverges from local learning is that the server will periodically
    collect model updates from the client devices and “average” them to update the
    global model, which is then redistributed to the client devices for further training.
    FL has shown to work well in the face of non-iid data distributions which are
    common in sensor applications. Therefore, FL is a promising solution for several
    challenges associated with decentralized machine learning, such as data privacy,
    communication efficiency, scalability, data unavailability or heterogeneity, system
    heterogeneity in terms of computation power, storage, and energy availability,
    computation efficiency, and better model performance [4], [5]. Standard FL may
    incur high communication costs as the model updates need to be shared with the
    central server, creating an interesting trade-off when considering that centralized
    training requires that all data be shared with the central server (Fig. 2a). In
    cases where the communication between the sensors and the central server is very
    poor (i.e., low data transfer rate, unreliable connection), this can be a significant
    challenge. Such overhead can affect individual sensor life and the overall performance
    of the application, especially if the sensor application has power constraints
    and limited connectivity [6]. One possible solution is to expand the infrastructure
    and use hierarchical FL. Under hierarchical FL, there are additional aggregation
    nodes that may have stronger connections to the nearby sensors. These aggregation
    nodes also participate in additional levels of aggregation to make sure knowledge
    is learned throughout the entire system. Hierarchical FL overcomes some of these
    issues by allowing data to remain on the edge devices, such as sensors and smart
    devices. It enables optimization of computational and communication overheads
    that can be customized to suit the needs of specific applications and networks.
    Fig. 1. Comparison of (a) Centralized, (b) Local, and (c) Federated learning architectures.
    Federated learning enables collaborative learning among multiple edge devices
    without compromising data privacy. Centralized learning relies on a central server
    to train a global model on data from all devices, while local learning trains
    multiple local models on disjoint subsets of data. Show All Fig. 2. Illustration
    of (a) Standard federated learning (FL) and (b) Hierarchical federated learning
    and their interaction between lot devices, edge and cloud servers. The aggregation
    nodes are where the local model updates from the participating devices or intermediary
    nodes are combined to form a global model. Show All Different approaches of hierarchical
    FL can be employed by making use of available networking hubs and structures,
    such as a cloud server that is accessed over the internet and an edge server,
    which is a computer server that is located closer to the devices that it serves
    at the network edge (Fig. 2b). One option is to aggregate models within a cloud
    server, while other options can involve hierarchical aggregation at the edge server
    which sends the model updates to the cloud for further aggregation or storage.
    This allows local processing power and storage capacity to perform distributed
    learning without relying solely on a central server, resulting in improved scalability,
    reduced latency and privacy preservation of sensitive data. While hierarchical
    FL has shown potential in various domains, including precision agriculture and
    environmental monitoring, [4] points out that very few production FL applications
    have been reported, with most work being proof-of-concept prototypes. The paradigm
    itself is relatively new and its implementation requires careful consideration
    of various issues such as data inequality [7], [8] and malicious attacks [9]–[11].
    Another important challenge to overcome with FL is the cost of adoption and the
    incentives to incorporate FL into existing systems. In FL, devices must contribute
    their computational resources and data to train a model. However, some organizations
    may be reluctant to participate in a large FL endeavor due to the computational
    resources needed to participate and data transfer and communication costs. Furthermore,
    there may not be the right incentives to join if a benefit from the global model''s
    performance is not properly recognized. For example, an industry leader may be
    less incentivized to adopt multi-organizational FL if they are already the primary
    source of data as their marginal benefit would be significantly lower. To address
    these challenges, various methods have been proposed to incentivize participation
    in FL. These methods include providing monetary or non-monetary rewards for contributing
    data, ensuring that the global model''s performance benefits all participants,
    and providing greater control over the use of data by participants. For example,
    [12] proposed a reward-based mechanism that provides tokens to devices that contribute
    data to the FL model, which can then be used to purchase services or products.
    Authors in [13] propose a privacy-preserving FL model that allows participants
    to retain control over their data and provides incentives for contributing high-quality
    data. In this article, we present a case study of the feasibility and benefits
    of FL for precision agricultural spraying and extend it to a larger conceptual
    hierarchical FL architecture for smart farming. We also discuss ongoing efforts
    to improve hierarchical FL systems using standardized quality frameworks to systematically
    identify and prioritize the efforts. Finally, we cover open problems associated
    with this technology and highlight its potential to transform numerous domains
    such as precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and smart
    infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a roadmap for further development of hierarchical
    FL in instrumentation and measurement. Federated Learning for Precision Spraying
    In the previous section, we discussed the different types of learning architectures
    that can be applied to edge devices. In this section, we present a case study
    involving precision spraying in agriculture (Fig. 3) to highlight the benefits
    of FL. Traditional spraying methods often apply pesticides uniformly across an
    entire field, leading to waste and potential harm to crops. In contrast, precision
    spraying uses cameras, optical sensors, and GPS receivers to provide accurate
    location data, enabling robots to apply spray only where necessary. However, the
    advanced data processing and machine learning required for precision spraying
    can be resource-intensive, making it challenging to perform all operations on
    the sensor or robot alone. Data collected from sensors can be processed using
    cloud computing relying on connectivity, but this can be a challenge in remote
    environments. By relying on computational resources at the edge server, data can
    be processed in real-time or limited-time to accelerate the decision-making process.
    FL can further improve spray precision by enabling learning from different data
    sources (e.g., across different locations with different distributions of plant/weed
    species) while preserving data privacy and security. This is particularly important
    for farmers who are concerned about data privacy and potential cyberattacks. Furthermore,
    FL can be flexibly performed on a network of edge devices potentially of different
    types, which can scale up or down to meet the needs of different agricultural
    operations, making it a valuable tool for precision spraying. Fig. 3. Precision
    spraying prototype using edge federated learning. Show All In this feasibility
    study, we limit the discussion to a single source of information, which is a near-infrared
    hyperspectral imaging system that is used to guide the operations of a mobile
    precision pesticide spraying robot at each of the three pasture sites (Site A,
    B and C). Each robot processes the input information using a local machine learning
    model (e.g., an image classifier implemented by a Convolutional Neural Network).
    The intent is to have the robot apply spray to a plant only if the plant is classified
    as a weed, ensuring minimal impact on crops. Storing a machine learning model
    locally ensures that spray operations can continue in areas without network coverage.
    Although the local model is trained using local data (∼71 Megabytes), it periodically
    receives updates (∼0.04 Megabytes) from the server via FL to incorporate knowledge
    learned from other pasture sites. With FL, communication is significantly reduced
    from 71 Megabytes to 0.04 Megabytes. Different forms of computation resources
    reside in each pasture site, with the model potentially being trained on the robot
    using single-board computational devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
    The locally-trained models from each pasture site are then aggregated using Federated
    Averaging [14], a popular aggregation algorithm in FL. The pasture sites are interconnected
    using communication infrastructure for sharing information and enabling FL. The
    dataset used during our evaluation consisted of four labelled classes: three species
    of pastoral weed and a background class of grass (Table 1). The evaluation results
    for our case study with different machine learning methods are shown in Fig. 4,
    whereby FL achieves 96% accuracy. This result is comparable to centralized learning
    where all the data are present, and a marked improvement compared to local learning
    where only local data are present. Our result confirms that FL is capable of addressing
    the dilemma between network latency, bandwidth limitations, data privacy and data
    sharing while providing comparable model performance. Table 1 Pasture Image dataset
    with imbalanced class distributions and disparate volumes of data across sites
    A Hierarchical Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Farrning We now consider
    broadening the precision spraying use case to a larger conceptual hierarchical
    FL architecture for smart farming. Precision agriculture often involves gathering
    heterogeneous data from various sensors within a farm. By leveraging FL, farmers
    can benefit from insights gained from other farms without compromising the privacy
    of their own raw data. This will enable them to enhance crop yields and minimize
    wastage. Fig. 5 illustrates the physical, cyber and networked (interconnected)
    view of a precision agriculture robot at work. Fig. 5a shows the “physical world”
    where the robot has sensors on board and navigates to perform tasks such as harvesting,
    weeding, and spraying. Fig. 5b represents the “cyber world” where the robot processes
    input information from its sensors using a local machine learning model to perform
    high priority tasks that must continue even when the communication fails (i.e.,
    navigation). The robot also monitors the quality of service for communication
    and decides whether to pass on further information or receive information from
    the cloud. Fig. 5c is the “interconnected world” where a group of robots is connected
    via a communication infrastructure for FL to share knowledge and improve their
    respective local machine learning models based on collective learned experiences.
    The types of sensor systems used for smart farming are heterogeneous. For example,
    a smart farm may rely heavily on IoT sensors and cameras to collect and process
    data related to soil quality and plant visual information. Additionally, smart
    farms may use multiple data sources to optimize farming operations. These data
    sources may include historical data, real-time sensor data, and publicly available
    data to predict soil water levels and future weather patterns with machine learning
    models. Fig. 6 illustrates an example of a hierarchical FL architecture for smart
    farming to train lightweight machine learning models on edge devices. Fig. 4.

    learning approaches trained on dataset described in table 1. Show All Fig. 5.

    of a hierarchical federated learning architecture for smart farming. Show All
    In this example, the architecture uses Apache Kafka, a popular distributed event
    streaming platform. Kafka is used to collect data from IoT devices and sensors
    located at the edge of the network, enabling real-time processing and response
    to changing conditions. Instead of waiting for large amounts of data to be collected
    and sent to a remote, central server, data streaming enables the sensor devices
    to transmit the local models to the edge servers in real-time—thus reducing latency
    and facilitating more efficient use of available network bandwidth. Hierarchical
    FL allows for adaptive clustering of the edge devices involved in the FL process,
    whereby groups of devices can be divided into smaller clusters for the training
    depending on device availability, scalability and power requirements. By making
    use of Kafka clusters to facilitate communication between the edge devices and
    the FL framework, fault tolerance can be incorporated with multiple brokers running
    on different machines to ensure high availability and data replication. FuncX
    [15] is a federated function-as-a-service platform that enables computation, represented
    as programming functions, to be dispatched for execution on edge resources. FuncX
    is used here to manage the deployment of the machine learning models to the edge
    devices and to invoke the models for inference and training. FuncX uses the Parsl
    [16] parallel programming library to manage the parallel execution of the FL tasks
    on edge devices. It is worth noting that this simple architecture can be easily
    extended to include heterogeneous resources such as Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetsons
    with GPUs, which can be deployed near the sensors for more local data processing.
    This introduces interesting research questions on the implicit trade-offs related
    to such system heterogeneity. Overall, using a hierarchical FL architecture for
    edge devices has the potential to revolutionize smart farming by enabling more
    efficient and effective data sharing, processing and decision-making, resulting
    in improved crop yields and reduced water waste. It is also resilient against
    issues such as unreliable network connectivity, which is an important consideration
    as limited network coverage is commonly encountered in agricultural land. Similar
    architectures can be developed for other applications such as: Environmental monitoring:
    Hierarchical FL could enable better analysis of data collected from remote sensors
    and devices, leading to better understanding and management of natural resources.
    Healthcare: Medical sites can collaborate and share machine learning models to
    improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment without having to share sensitive
    patient information. Wearable monitoring devices: IoT devices are integrated into
    devices to monitor human biometric data such as heart rate, temperature and movement
    patterns aiming to identify potential safety hazards and improve worker safety
    in the hazardous work environment. Application Requirements for Hierarchical Federated
    Learning Hierarchical FL systems have great potential to realize new sensor-driven
    applications, as discussed in the previous section. However, the technology faces
    numerous challenges due to the diverse nature of these applications and the equally
    diverse performance requirements. Some of these requirements can conflict with
    one another. To address the needs of these systems systematically, we recommend
    using two widely recognized standards for software quality and data quality, which
    are the ISO/IEC 25012 [17] and ISO/IEC 25010 [18] frameworks, respectively. By
    applying these frameworks, we can identify and prioritize the requirements, design
    appropriate performance metrics, and develop techniques and algorithms that optimize
    the trade-offs between conflicting requirements. This will help ensure that hierarchical
    FL systems are reliable, efficient, and effective and can be deployed in a wide
    range of real-world applications. Functionality is a crucial metric that measures
    the system''s ability to perform consistently and accurately over time. This metric
    is closely related to data quality since poor-quality data can result in unreliable
    and inaccurate machine learning models. Optimizing hierarchical FL parameters,
    applying model personalization and transfer learning techniques, and adapting
    the models to the specific characteristics of each device can help improve functionality.
    Reliability is important for edge devices, which often operate under intermittent
    connectivity, mobility, and resource-constrained conditions [19]. These challenges
    can make it difficult to develop efficient and reliable FL systems. To overcome
    these challenges, researchers are exploring techniques such as task offloading
    [20], adaptive sampling [21], and reinforcement learning to optimize the system
    performance and adapt to changing edge computing environments [22]. Redundancy
    can be introduced by configuring the edge devices into different clusters, which
    may improve reliability in hierarchical FL. Performance efficiency can be evaluated
    by quantifying the computation and communication overheads. In hierarchical FL
    systems, the edge server acts as a coordinator, responsible for aggregating and
    processing the data from multiple edge devices [23]. This can create a huge computationaland
    communication burden on the edge server, which can result in high latency, reduced
    system performance, and increased communication costs. To mitigate these challenges,
    researchers are exploring techniques such as partitioning and scheduling to distribute
    the computation and communication load across multiple edge servers and among
    cloud and edge servers [6]. The use of data streaming techniques helps to further
    reduce communication overheads while also increasing the reliability of the edge
    systems. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, mobility, and varying edge
    computing environments, engineers should consider metrics like system scalability,
    cost/benefit balance, and application size on the edge device to evaluate resource
    utilization. Techniques like task offloading, adaptive sampling, and reinforcement
    learning can further optimize system performance and adapt to changing edge computing
    environments. The convergence rate of the learning process is also a critical
    consideration. Compatibility is essential in terms of device heterogeneity, where
    edge devices may not have the same type of sensors and may run on different operating
    systems and software. Edge devices used in FL systems may differ in terms of their
    hardware capabilities, such as CPU processing power, memory, and battery life,
    as well as their software configurations, such as operating systems and libraries.
    This heterogeneity can lead to statistical heterogeneity in the data collected
    from the devices, making it challenging to develop models that generalize well
    across all devices [24]. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring
    methods such as transfer learning [25] and model personalization [26] that can
    adapt the models to the specific characteristics of each device. Security is a
    significant concern for hierarchical FL systems. FL provides some level of privacy,
    but to protect data and models from malicious actors, techniques like secure aggregation,
    differential privacy, blockchain, and homomorphic encryption can be applied. Hierarchical
    FL systems may have edge servers from different sources, which makes the systems
    more vulnerable to security threats such as data leakage, model poisoning, and
    inference attacks [23]. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring
    techniques such as secure aggregation [27], differential privacy [28], and homomorphic
    encryption [29] to ensure that the data and models are protected from malicious
    actors. Metrics like confidentiality, currentness, and reliability can be used
    to evaluate the severity of security challenges, as defined by the ISO/IEC 25010
    standard for data security and accessibility. Dynamic infrastructure is a common
    problem in hierarchical FL systems. In these settings, the aggregation nodes are
    not necessarily static or fixed. It may be necessary for the aggregation node
    to change over time if a node is rendered offline due to low battery or a poor
    communication channel. This makes ensuring stable hierarchical FL difficult. Strategies
    to prevent this can be resource-aware real-time decision making where edge devices
    coordinate among themselves to decide how communication should be done among them.
    Software support: Currently, common FL frameworks (e.g., Flower, PySyft) do not
    natively support hierarchical FL, especially for highly dynamic systems where
    infrastructure may change over time. Opportunities and Open Problems The opportunities
    and future research directions for using FL for sensing and measurement can be
    organized into three key axes: resource management and coordination of devices
    that make up the FL system; data management and access; and application-specific
    considerations, such as the use of UAVs [30] and Internet of Medical Things [23].
    In this section, we elaborate on the first two axes, which have general applicability
    across different domains. The third is highly domain-specific and thus not included
    in this general roadmap. Resource Management and Coordination FL opens up new
    methods for supporting fault tolerance of IoT devices. The use of multiple IoT
    devices increases the completeness of data and facilitates the detection and correction
    of erroneous readings and faulty operations. An FL system capable of supporting
    multiple heterogeneous devices and able to recover from faults is reported in
    [31]. A hierarchical FLsystem able to account for the hierarchy of edge servers
    may result in multiple memberships for IoT devices requiring recovery and adaptation
    at several levels. Another exciting direction is the integration of self-adaptivity
    into IoT devices using hierarchical FL. IoT devices become self-adaptive by learning
    from their past behaviors and performance data, can detect changes in environmental
    conditions and predict equipment failure, and automatically adjust device parameters
    [32]. As IoT devices collect knowledge about their environment, they must share
    knowledge to better understand their environment and its dynamics. However, a
    collective system of self-aware devices does not have a centralized knowledge
    base. FL could facilitate sharing of knowledge between devices as a collective.
    Unlike context-aware systems, which typically assume a ground-truth-based environmental
    context that is true for all IoT devices, it is explicitly acknowledged that self-aware
    devices in the collective systems will have different experiences of a shared
    environment [33]. A federated system can be expanded to incorporate information
    for the edge servers at the membership level to provide self-adaptiveness for
    different branches of the edge computing infrastructure and provide context on
    how the information was gathered. Hierarchical FL architectures are inherently
    resilient against network latency and bandwidth limitations. They therefore open
    up new opportunities for network optimization due to the heterogeneity of edge
    environments. For example, network routing needs to be dynamically adapted and
    optimized to the traffic patterns and topologies to improve network throughput
    and latency. Meanwhile, new network designs and paradigms can be introduced, such
    as software-defined networking and blockchain. New algorithms and techniques that
    are specifically designed to optimize resource allocation in edge computing environments
    can dynamically allocate computational and communication resources to different
    tasks based on their priority and application-specific requirements. This allows
    for real-time balancing of multiple objectives. For example, a healthcare application
    that uses a large number of medical sensors to collect, adapt, and react to medical
    information in real time requires security robustness and resource optimization
    for computational and communication tasks [34]. The energy consumption of IoT
    devices and edge computing infrastructure can be optimized by dynamically adapting
    the computational workload and communication overhead to the available energy
    and power constraints. Exploring multi-objective optimization techniques such
    as evolutionary algorithms and Pareto optimization is another direction of research
    that is crucial due to the complexity of hierarchical FL systems. There is a need
    to balance multiple objectives and constraints, such as communication overhead,
    energy consumption, privacy preservation, and security, while creating a global
    machine learning model with limited and heterogeneous resources. This requires
    the coordination of multiple clients and servers at different layers of the system,
    creating a complex interaction network. Additionally, the underlying technologies
    used, such as wireless communication, data storage and processing, and machine
    learning algorithms, introduce their sets of constraints and trade-offs that need
    to be considered in the optimization process, where not only performance but scalability
    needs careful consideration when optimizing these conflicting objectives. Fig.
    7. Future directions for hierarchical federated learning in sensor applications.
    Show All Data Management and Access While FL adds a layer of privacy around user
    data by eliminating the need to share data with others, sharing model updates
    do not offer privacy guarantees as individual data points can be reconstructed
    [35]. To address this issue, privacy-preserving FL can be expanded using techniques
    such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, digital signature, and hash
    functions [23], [36]. These techniques enable FL in edge computing environments
    while preserving the privacy of data and participants. For instance, differential
    privacy provides privacy guarantees for medical image analysis. In unstable edge
    computing environments, such as smart healthcare, a privacy protection scheme
    is proposed that provides gradient privacy and resistance to collusion and replay
    attacks for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) [23]. A privacy protection technique
    for a hierarchical FL system needs to be computationally efficient and adaptable
    to the underlying learning algorithms, with an ability to effectively scale to
    a large number of clients and servers. Fig. 7 summarizes some of the opportunities
    presented by hierarchical FL that make it an exciting area of research for engineers
    and academicians in the field of instrumentation and measurement. Conclusion Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers have a critical role to play in driving technological
    advancements to address global challenges and advance the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. Hierarchical federated
    learning is an emerging technology that enhances the intelligence of sensor systems
    in many applications such as environmental quality management, personalized health-care
    devices, and precision agriculture. Secure, resilient, and robust sensor systems
    that support real-time, data-driven decision-making are valuable infrastructure
    for helping us reduce carbon emissions (SDG 13–Climate Action), promote sustainable
    urbanization (SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities), and improve healthcare
    outcomes (SDG 3–Health and Well-being). We urge researchers and practitioners
    to collaborate on the opportunities and open problems presented in this article
    to realize the full potential of this technology. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research

    in areas at risk of flooding. SECTION II. Literature Reiew For a review of relevant
    literature and research. Factors relating to the surveillance system as a flood.
    Mr. Pongsak Chutikan and et., all. (2553) [2] The research on the flow rate of
    runoff. Or a maximum flow rate of runoff (peak flow discharge), formed by the
    precipitation Each is the result of an act shared between downpours indices moisture
    pre-existing areas or values. API (Antecedent Precipitation Index), for example.
    Downpours upstream in plenty of space on the water in the soil less. Runoff flowing
    into streams and rivers to rise not much contrast with more downpours over the
    upper area where the soil is saturated with water. The runoff flows into streams
    and rivers are high. Rising rapidly Similarly, the API will be the consequence
    of actions jointly. The rainfall Deposition over the area upstream of it. With
    the area upstream of the control system to absorb rainwater catchment and soil,
    including the type and depth of the soil layer. The factors that control the drainage.
    Soil into streams and rivers and conveying water to the lower area. Including
    topography and swampy ground. The idea or SCS (Soil Conservation Service) or NRCS
    (Natural Resources Conservation Services) today introduced the idea to create
    a mathematical model to estimate. The rate of flow of runoff caused by rainfall
    each. From the initial configuration of points. Factors affecting the absorption
    and soil drainage. The scores were all together as a CN or runoff curve number
    before the totals were adjusted to the API first start with rainfall that fell
    the previous 5 days, then the rainfall data. Falling on the date of valuation.
    Predicted flow rate. Variations of runoff in streams and rivers again. Resources
    Conservation Services) today introduced the idea to create a mathematical model
    to estimate. Mr. surathep thongjinda [3]. Research on flood early warning systems
    found that the Disaster Research Center. Forestry departments have established
    flood warning systems. The system is an automatic water level measurement system,
    which uses the pressure of a water holmium pressure gauge to detect the change
    of the pool. The changes of quenching water and water are calculated every fifteen
    minutes. Automatic alarm processing is carried out at the station. Or order to
    send alarm center Ho National Disaster Center Ho through the service provider
    of GPRS system. Name connection or communication between stations and yards If
    you don''t contact the central government. The water early warning system will
    also automatically process and make decisions about the alarm or give a signal
    to the villagers. You can give a warning. KomKris Narirat (2550) [4] studied the
    research system alarm flooding by using a microcontroller that Bangkok has prepared
    alarm flooding by the principle of alarm floods with a microcontroller. When installing
    a rainwater tank led by Vice rain with a device that measures rainfall. Keep an
    eye on the rain gauge to measure rainfall for the area to be alert with a microcontroller.
    The connection between the rainfall to support microcontroller is a master dealer
    will load the program has been installed, and the cable to the device, such as
    sirens and devices connected to the phone. The flood warning along with microcontrollers
    that will run when the rainfall falling on equipment rainwater. It has set the
    bar to wait for the water-downed. By tipping the beam tilt each time it sends
    a signal to the microcontroller. The control for the tilt of the beam from the
    rain by a microcontroller to count bobbing (beam tilt each time equal volume parts
    water to 0.3 mm), Therefore, when an experimental check comparison criterion in
    water at 1-hour flood warning machine which will measure the amount of water in
    a 3 level is moderate rain. Heavy rain. Very heavy rain the program will check
    the condition compared with 1 hour in time by the amount of water to moderate
    the light bulb 1 light meter water levels. The light bulb 2 be installed in water
    volume at most levels. The light bulb 3 to stick by comparison to make the alarm.
    Mr. Chuchock Wongravikul (2551) [5] studied the research. Forecasting and warning
    system that floods and water levels. The Mae Ping high flood embankment occurred
    several times in the city tremendous economic damage. This is one factor that
    causes severe damage. Not have the flood warnings ahead long enough to take action
    quickly and prevent outages. Data indicate that the water level in the flooded
    areas. They cannot forecast the level of water in the river will take place precisely
    in advance. The lack of understanding of the flood situation well enough. Therefore,
    forecasting and warning systems are effective, so there is an urgent need. As
    a precautionary measure, flooding the building had to take action. Which for many
    years could not catch for flooding to occur in the near future, forecasting and
    flood warning system in the city is one of the measures in the plan. This is a
    result of the warning; people have been known for more than 7 hours before it
    was discovered that there are several limitations in forecasting and flood warning
    systems that are currently available. The actions Planning for the severe floods.
    Only one Due to the weakness of the system involved in risk areas. Khanista Namee
    and et.al. (2019). Proposed the emergency platform that monitors the location
    of the AEDs and controls the opening/closing of the AED cabinets through the App.
    Also, the user can check the status of the AED through the App. This platform
    also specifies the exact location of the accident via the GPS system. Further
    statistical tests revealed that the location of the AED had 95% accuracy, can
    be controlled accurately 96%, with the average response time through the App 658
    ms. The results indicate that this platform supports EMS services more effective
    [6], [7]. SECTION III. The System Design The Flood surveillance and alert system

    IEEE Conference Location: Pitesti, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Monitoring
    of water quality is an important stage when ensuring water safety and is based
    on both European Union and national legislation. Currently, more than 90% of the
    population worldwide consumes controlled water [1]. The routine monitoring system,
    which only tests a small fraction of all distributed water, can only give the
    minimum standards for quality monitoring. The monitoring results show that contaminants
    are present, and a threat is already present in the water, endangering consumers’
    safety [2]. Contamination can result in an outbreak of water in the worst-case
    scenario. The purpose of the SWAM (Smart WAter Management system for better environmental
    sustainability) project is to enable water quality monitoring and use in domains
    such as smart agriculture. Current water quality monitoring stations have disadvantages
    that limit the control of their use in the supply networks: unsustainable energy
    consumption, fragility, manual calibration, lack of precision, needs and high
    maintenance costs [3]. The SWAM alternative addresses the key challenges for the
    water sector, namely: the economy of providing low-cost sensor arrays, implementation
    in remote locations, adequate data acquisition/management and scalability. An
    approach to risk management could be the prevention of contamination and preplanning
    of countermeasures should contamination occur [2]. An extensive management protocol
    and risk assessment concerning the whole water production systems, from raw water
    sources to consumer’s taps, might be an answer to “complete” safe water monitoring.
    An option to achieve a comprehensive risk assessment and risk management system
    for a safe water system in agriculture is to apply Water Safety Planning (WSP)
    protocol. Water safety plans are used for risk management at the time of the distribution
    and treatment, ensuring that monitoring is not the primary method used for water
    quality management and further minimizing the risk of contamination. A set of
    instruments exists for establishing and operating a water safety plan for irrigation-water
    in agriculture, which will be discussed later in this paper. It is demonstrated
    how an event, such as raw water contamination is recognized, how risks are assessed,
    then a decision-making process and management action is taken, resulting in a
    new enhanced change in water quality. Further, beside the current section, the
    paper comprises other four sections. Section 2 explores the state of the art of
    blockchain technology. Section 3 investigates the cybersecurity risks in the water
    sector. Section 4 discusses the technologies used in the project. Section 5 brings
    conclusions and explains future work. SECTION II. Related Work IoT devices are
    being used in as many areas as possible. Because of this, the topic is treated
    by as many researchers as possible who test their applicability in as many projects
    as possible. With this advantage brought by the IoT technology, the problems caused
    by the cyber attackers who try to steal the data sent through these devices have
    started to appear. As can be seen in the article [4], the authors analyze the
    applicability of IoT devices in smart homes, smart cities, Smart Healthcare, Smart
    Environment and Agriculture and Energy Conservation. All this has been analyzed
    from the point of view of both cyber and physical security. Depending on the application
    in which these IoT devices are used, the threats may be different. Researchers
    have found blockchain as a common solution for secure data storage. With the help
    of this technology used mainly in the field of cryptocurrencies or banking transactions,
    they were able to ensure a much higher level of security for the data received
    from the sensors [5]. A brief definition of blockchain can be the storage of digital
    information in a public database in the form of blocks. The link between the network
    blocks is made with the help of cryptography, each block having a hash that connects
    it with the preceding block, a transaction and timestamp information. The link
    to the previous block (hash) can be compared to a digital fingerprint, representing
    a unique key that can identify the block and its contents. Due to the appearance
    of high-performance and fast computers, hashes are not enough to prevent manipulation;
    thus, to avoid this problem, one solution would be to have a proof-of-work system
    that slows down the creation of a block. Therefore, this technology has the main
    advantage that the data stored once in the blocks can no longer be modified. These
    blockchain networks are mainly used for: address derivation, data security, and
    block header security [6]. One of the most important resources is represented
    by water, having many roles in obtaining food, electricity, sewerage but also
    for the proper functioning of the ecosystem, human health and socio-economic progress.
    Thus, the study of water quality is necessary to obtain all these benefits. This
    can be seen in the paper [7], which analyses a wide range of sensors that can
    be used in the study of water quality, such as: pH sensors, dissolved oxygen sensors
    or micronutrient sensors. The security of this data will be done with the help
    of a blockchain network that will use several Big Data located in different locations.
    The advantage comes from the fact that in these databases, whole data packets
    will not be stored, but they will be distributed in several databases [8]. Blockchain
    technology is widespread and applied in many fields, such as healthcare, logistics,
    transportation and energy systems [9–12]. Regarding water systems, several articles
    and initiatives discuss the use of the blockchain in water systems, namely: water
    resources management, water quality, wastewater management and use. Blockchain-based
    water asset trading systems aim to promote water consumption and create a market
    for water asset trading between consumers. This approach leads to: encouraging
    the use of alternative water resources channels for its collection (e.g., improved
    shallow groundwater resources systems and rainwater collection systems), reducing
    water leakage and minimizing operating costs [13–14]. SECTION III. Cybersecurity
    Risks In the Water Sector The Romanian national cybersecurity strategy describes
    the following priorities: Creating compulsory educational programmes at different
    levels of the educational cycle on the safe use of computing and internet equipment.
    Developing a security system by raising awareness about the risks, threats and
    vulnerabilities originating from cyberspace and the need to safeguard the information
    systems. Providing professional training to employers that work in cybersecurity
    with the widespread promotion of professional certifications. Participating in
    the initiatives of international organizations to establish and define a set of
    cyberspace confidence-building measures. Developing and supporting national and
    worldwide collaboration in the domain of cybersecurity between the private and
    public sectors. A cyberattack on critical water sector activities might damage
    public health and safety, threaten national security, and conclude in costly repair
    and recovery efforts to solve system issues and data loss. Attacks that cause
    operational failure, contamination, or service outages may result in casualties
    and illness. It can also endanger emergency response by medical personnel and
    firefighters, as well as have a negative influence on food supply and transportation
    infrastructure. [15]. The NIS (Network and Information Security) Directive goal
    is to ensure a unified legislative framework for cybersecurity in the EU. Active
    entities in the sectors of transport, healthcare, water, energy, banking, financial
    market infrastructures, and digital infrastructure that have been identified by
    the Member State as operators of essential services must implement appropriate
    security measures and report serious incidents to the national authorities [16].
    The protocol of decision-making process, risk management and assessment in connection
    to the detection of water quality changes is described in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The protocol
    of decision-making process, risk management and assessment in connection to the
    detection of water quality changes Show All The use of online water quality sensors,
    which allows for the creation of a real-time picture of water quality changes,
    is one alternative for improving water safety. The information about the observed
    change in water quality (or other physical abnormal state) is a significant aspect
    in risk management since it generates a signal that is sent to the water works
    monitoring room via ICT systems, resulting in an alarm. The waterworks staff should
    then apply their knowledge (risk assessment), which should lead to either dismissing
    the observation or initiating corrective mitigation activities. SECTION IV. Technologies
    The trustworthy document can have four different aspects: IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    Big Data and Blockchain. A. Big Data The majority of Big Data definitions are
    concerned with the amount of data stored. Big Data has other key characteristics,
    such as data velocity and variety, in addition to its capacity. The three Vs of
    Big Data (volume, velocity and variety) provide a comprehensive description, dispelling
    the idea that Big Data is exclusively about data volume. Furthermore, each of
    the three Vs has its own set of analytics concerns, as seen in Fig. 2. Fig. 2.
    The three Vs of Big Data Show All User organizations have been gathering Web data
    for years, but for most organizations, it’s been a kind of storage. RFID data
    from supply chain applications, text data from call centre applications, semi
    structured data from various business-to-business (B2B) operations, and geospatial
    information in logistics were all gathered and stored as similar untapped Big
    Data. The difference is that far more users are now analysing Big Data instead
    of merely hoarding it. The few organizations that have been analysing this data
    are now doing it at a more sophisticated and complex level. The efficient analytical
    leveraging of Big Data is new compared to Big Data itself [17]. In the SWAM project,
    the values of some water parameters (such as PH or others) are measured and stored.
    Also, according to the purpose of the project, SWAM needs to measure and analyse
    the weather features: temperature, humidity, rain and cumulative rain (mm), air
    pressure, wind direction, speed and blow and PYR, soil features (humidity) or
    CO, CO2 footprint. Also, we need to measure soil parameters. For all this, Big
    Data is needed because, for example, in a few weeks we can have even more than
    20.000 measured data. This massive amount of information must be saved and analysed
    [18]. B. Cloud Computing A smart water system is developed to collect actionable
    and useful data about the pressure, flow and distribution of specific water locations.
    Data is acquired from the sensors that are connected to the system. Further, the
    data are analysed and stored in the Cloud where a private server and web-page
    is created on top of the IoT architecture. Cloud computing provides applications
    with the essential infrastructure, such as storage, platform, services, databases,
    and data analysis tools, via the Internet, allowing for faster innovation, more
    flexible resources, and cost reductions. Fig. 3. Cloud Computing Architecture
    Show All Many forms of tools and applications are required in Cloud Computing
    Architecture (Fig. 3): Awareness application: to make the user aware of the quality
    of the water When the water quality exceeded a certain threshold, a smartphone
    can be utilized to alert the user. Control and management application: this program
    allows the water staff to control and adjust the pumping regulations based on
    the data analysed for each zone. Big data analytic tool: analyse the information
    gathered. The data will be gathered and analysed for a period of time determined
    by the end-user in order to improve water quality. The IoT Cloud will offer the
    system with an efficient and reliable architecture for the acquired data, as this
    massive volume of data must be stored and analysed. C. Internet of Things The
    system is focused on monitoring the water, air and weather conditions for irrigation
    in Smart Agriculture by managing, operating the water quality, and improving the
    operation of the surface water network. The sensor network uses a reconfigurable
    wireless transceiver to connect to a Cloud platform and includes multiple low-cost
    sensors that can measure various parameters (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Internet of Things
    simplified architecture Show All D. Blockchain The proposed architecture for the
    Smart Watering System is presented in Fig. 5. It will have the ability of blockchain
    security. And each transaction made by the system will be tracked during the processes.
    This ability will not only provide security, but it will also give privacy features.
    The smart devices are acting as nodes, and each node is responsible for creating
    a copy of the blockchain. If a user of the system wants to use it, then each node
    has to be verified before a transaction occurs (electronic voting). If the majority
    is considered valid, each of them will be registered in the blockchain structure
    with a hash code. Each copy is then forwarded to be used in the system. The proposed
    system will be updated every 15 minutes, thus it will be impossible to be hacked
    and to forge the security system. Henceforth the requests of the received data
    from each device will be secured via Blockchain. Fig. 5. Smart Watering System
    model based on Blockchain Show All SECTION V. Conclusions The best route for data
    security is to periodically store the values of the monitored water quality parameters
    in its own centralized platform. The information about the water quality is sent
    periodically according to the changes of the values coming from the parameters,
    and the platform receives the information through the security mechanisms with
    the help of a register. To store all this data you also need a timestamp, which
    is stored in the database and finally an encrypted backup is generated in an external
    location to save the information in case of unavailability or data loss. The design
    of the platform and security solutions is a step towards the security and safety
    of accurate data, thus contributing to a good quality of the data monitored in
    the SWAM project. As future work, the most precise controls on cyber threats will
    be considered, such as: a Gateway-which verifies the authenticity of the platform,
    the communication protocols between the Gateway and the platform that uses TLS/SSL
    security (MQTTS / HTTPS). ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by a grant of

    Luxembourg, Luxembourg SECTION I. Introduction Food security calls for the intensive
    use of irrigation in agriculture at the same time that water is increasingly becoming
    a precious and scarce asset for mankind. Irrigation for agriculture is the most
    significant consumer of freshwater in the world, amounting to 70% of freshwater
    [5]. In an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by under-irrigation, farmers
    feed more water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is challenged
    but also water and energy is wasted. The Internet of Things (IoT) [2] and other
    related technologies can be used for that purpose, but it faces several challenges
    such as the lack of easy-to-use software tools and platforms, communication constraints
    in rural areas and sensor integration issues. Such technological features in agriculture
    also bring severe security risks, since some machines have autonomous systems
    and data generated by IoT devices could expose critical aspects of the production
    or even they may be manipulated to support wrong conclusions about crop development.
    The SWAMP1 project develops IoT based methods and approaches for smart water management
    in precision irrigation domain and to pilot the approaches in four places, two
    pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil. The same underlying
    SWAMP platform can be customized to different pilots considering different countries,
    climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP architecture may be implemented in a range
    of deployment configurations involving the use of smart algorithms and analytics
    in the cloud, fog-based smart decisions located on the farm premises and possibly
    mobile fog nodes acting in the field (e.g., drones or in the central pivot irrigation
    mechanisms). The four SWAMP pilots are based on the similar technical solutions
    and deal with different crops and have different primary goals. CBEC Pilot (Bologna/Italy):
    the main objective of the Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia Centrale (CBEC) pilot is
    optimizing water distribution to the farms. Intercrop Pilot (Cartagena/Spain):
    Intercrop Iberica addresses several challenges since production is in a dry area,
    and a considerable amount of water comes from a desalination plant. The primary
    goal for Intercrop is using water more rationally. Guaspari Pilot (Espirito Santo
    do Pinhal/Brazil): The Guaspari Winery transfers the wine grape harvesting to
    the winter season (June-August) using irrigation techniques. The main goal for
    Guaspari is improving wine quality. MATOPIBA Pilot (Barreiras/Brazil): The Rio
    das Pedras Farm is located in the MATOPIBA region, and irrigation is mostly performed
    by center pivots. This main pilot goal is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation
    system based on Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production
    and save energy used in irrigation. SECTION II. Iot in Precision Irrigation for
    Agriculture The SWAMP proj ect is being built upon existing research such as FIW
    ARE that is EU-funded IoT solution library used for smart applications [8] and
    precision irrigation [7]. SWAMP shares several features with other precision irrigation
    initiatives such as FIGARO project [4] that aims at increasing water productivity
    and improving irrigation practices through a cost-effective precision irrigation
    management platform not directly involving IoT. SWAMP intends to use IoT combined
    with cloud-based services and big data analytics and conduct experiments in real
    settings. Brewster et al. discuss the deployment of large-scale pilots for IoT
    in agriculture and describe technologies that might be present in some agrifood
    domains [3]. SECTION III. Security Challenges for Iot in Agriculture In general,
    IoT has many security requirements, such as data privacy, confidentiality and
    integrity, authentication, authorization and accounting, and availability of services
    [6]. The security mechanisms have to be energy efficient, since many IoT devices
    are limited in power, processing, and memory resources. There is no unified vision
    on security in the IoT [1] [6], but many security solutions are being proposed
    and may be used in smart agriculture and irrigation. Water is a critical resource
    and an attacker may take control of the system and a whole crop would be decimated,
    due to lack or excess of irrigation. A DoS (Denial of Service) attack in the sensors,
    irrigation actuators or in the distribution system may affect the availability
    of the system. Changes in the values of some sensors are also a threat that may
    cause systems or decision makers to take wrong actions and compromise months of
    efforts and production goals. If an attacker takes control of the actuators, the
    irrigation and water distribution is compromised, wrongly irrigating some crop.
    Using eavesdropping, intruders may have access to private data about the farm
    and crop yield information and even manipulate the commodity markets, which is
    even a more extensive threat. Autonomous vehicles, such as drones and tractors,
    used for collecting images and crop monitoring, must also be secured. An unauthorized
    node in the network (sensor node or drone) may send false information about the
    crop. A drone or sensor node performing the Sybil attack could send fake images
    and false measurements, leading to the incorrect interpretation of the actual
    soil conditions, incorrect calculation of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index), and the like. The SWAMP architecture must deal with the control of data
    by the farmers or producers, ensuring that each owner controls their data and
    decides the access control to the data and the services. The distribution of water
    between users is very sensitive issue also addressed by SWAMP. Trust, privacy
    and security must be the basis of information exchange. Data anonymization is
    another helpful technique for data governance and even some regulation and legal
    frameworks for agriculture are being discussed by governments. There are also
    many innovative proposals in the literature for security solution in various domains
    of IoT [7] [8], including 6LoWPAN networks. SDN (Software Defined Networking)
    architecture for IoT allows administrators to have a centralized view of the IoT
    system [8] and to implement security services. A disruptive technology in security
    is blockchain, which will have great importance in the security of IoT [7]. One
    possible application is in the supply chain and lifecycle of an IoT device. For
    instance, it is possible to track all the attributes, relationships and events
    related to a device. The use of smart contracts is also a promising mechanism
    to be used in new methods for authentication, authorization, and privacy of IoT
    devices [6]. One of the most relevant security challenges for IoT in agriculture
    is not only the integration of technologies but also to understand and correlate
    the expected sequence of events and behavior of agriculture applications. SWAMP
    has a multitude of characteristics to be evaluated and a baseline must be created
    to promote security effectiveness. Regardless of the data acquisition rate, or
    the number of installed sensors, the system will probably have a partial view
    of the environment. As a consequence, applications may create a partial profile
    of the crop and related environment, which does not necessarily correspond to
    that crop. Therefore, inadvertent use of a given profile may cause harm to a crop,
    and security mechanisms should take this into account when producing their results.
    The SWAMP project deals with many of these challenges and requirements. The platform
    must provide efficient authentication, authorization and access control mechanisms.
    It is important to keep data apart from farms in our pilots. The access to the
    platform must be allowed only for identified and authorized users, using FIWARE
    security generic enablers (GE) and the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The confidentiality
    of the data must be provided using state of the practice cryptography. Wireless
    and wired communications must use existing security features of the underlying
    technology and existing security protocols. The availability of the platform must
    be provided even in case of Internet disconnections using local components (fog
    computing) to keep the platform running properly. SECTION IV. Conclusion SWAMP
    intends to use IoT to improve the use of water resources in heterogeneous pilots,
    each one with its own characteristics and challenges. The adoption of an open-source
    platform as FIWARE as the basis of SWAMP platform development has advantages but
    the use of IoT in agriculture also brings several security challenges, since a
    multitude of threats may cause severe and irreversible damages to the crop. In
    order to protect IoT devices and cloud systems, the SWAMP platform should not
    only deal with device security, data confidentiality and authentication mechanisms,
    but also with mechanisms to avoid fake data. The latter may result in misunderstandings
    about crops or may allow eavesdropping that may cause manipulation of commodity
    markets. Authors References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes More Like This

    of Bam, Iran Chapter © 2021 4.1 Introduction Nowadays, due to climate change,
    global economic crisis, circumstances at post COVID-19 era efficient construction
    designs following proper health policies and web g.i.s utilities, training e-learning
    ICT''s tools for stakeholders within sustainable tourism infrastructures are becoming
    necessary. Therefore, advancements in information telecommunications technologies
    (ICT''s, IoT''s) are necessary for proper operations project management within
    particular safe green tourism infrastructures [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The latter could
    be useful for safe green tourism transportation systems, efficient highway designs
    in supply chain of goods at tourism services, enhancing safe travelling to associated
    cultural facilities, ecological places, archaeological sites, heritage monuments
    and green accurate agricultural facilities [8, 9]. In this way several reclamation
    projects at brownfields and particular agricultural, educational tourism activities
    about the importance of sustainability and green circular economy could be supported
    by clean technologies, proper monitoring environmental health systems, efficient
    green hydraulic designs, effective hybrid waste water unit designs, exploitation
    of robust hydro-geotechnical designs, reclamation projects related to landfill
    emissions for soil health, renewable energy, water resources recovery, safe constructions
    at veterinary units, irrigation systems, transportation facilities, tourism green
    building infrastructures and food safety for public health [8, 10]. There is undoubtedly
    a potential in technology to teach in ways that lead to deeper e-learning experiences,
    and training case studies should be available to them so as to practice them to
    meet the current needs of the market sector based on the curricula of their studies.
    In this way, proper case studies for all ages and levels in vocational education
    training at post-COVID-19 pandemic era should be supported. There is a necessity
    of understanding technology, pedagogy and content knowledge in order to integrate
    technology effectively for the purposes of advancing e-learning related to particular
    efficient construction facilities that promote integrated geo-environmental designs
    for circular economy, supporting particular alternative types of tourism for all
    ages [11,12,13,14,15]. 4.2 Safe Sustainable Tourism Destinations Useful project
    management information management utilities with ICTs and IoTs are necessary,
    including efficient hydraulic designs, associated green construction designs,
    sustainable logistics and safe mobility, road network services information, tourism
    logistics for shipment of goods between stakeholders, sustainable mobility information
    and proper use of renewable goods manufactures. Moreover, in order to achieve
    competitive experiencing, travel destinations are necessary with safe innovative
    construction designs for sports, agrotourism and transport facilities, combined
    with e-learning solutions in the linkage between emerging environmental technologies,
    vocational education, green CE and solutions for tourism in crisis at post-COVID-19
    pandemic era. Findings show that more research is needed to support alternative
    types of tourism related to sustainable constructions that promote agritourism,
    sports and cultural heritage events supporting regional development with green
    tourism CE. In this way, new opportunities for investments at regional level are
    created, generating effective construction design solutions for tourism in crisis
    that support sustainable designs for all, promoting alternative types of tourism
    related to health tourism and creation of new jobs at post-COVID-19 pandemic era,
    taking the right measures for protection of public health. However, innovative
    numerical modeling utilities for project management in environmental and energy
    designs are useful for planners, project managers, engineers, economists, hygienists,
    decision-makers and stakeholders, saving time and money can be achieved in actual
    construction rather than applying any structural procedure for project management
    such as cost scheduling, estimation, planning and control. Further, success or
    failure depends on the balance between quality and timing of the geoinformation
    in associated applications for stakeholders between industrial ecological health,
    sustainability, safety and innovative constructions, environmental energy designs
    available to the engineers and circular economy’s planners, policy makers from
    the database. In this, right way could be achieved for a successful sustainable
    urban city with efficient operations in local level for community healthcare centers;
    interactive activities in sports, infrastructures for medical sports, agricultural
    facilities; health tourism facilities and other related types of tourism associated
    with sustainability and circular economy; clean technologies; renewable resources;
    sustainable transportation; safe mobility; sustainable construction designs and
    landscape management and other associated infrastructures that promote sustainability,
    and new jobs are created for our global community. Developing countries face unique
    challenges with the construction, energy design, efficient water resources use,
    associated designs in circular economy within environmental clean technologies
    and operations of new infrastructures protecting infrastructures that promote
    sustainability, public health, environmental impact assessments and adverse health
    effects. Nations with mature infrastructure have followed traditional technology
    models for design, planning, construction and operation of facilities. An integrated
    environmental health policy is demanded for the sustainable development of our
    society. Community health centers and infrastructures associated with public health
    protection should follow the right strategic aims, guidelines, principles based
    on the next flowchart. In Fig. 4.1 is presented a roadmap for safe travel destinations
    promoting sustainable tourism within an integrated eco-health policy within circular
    economy, supporting innovative civil environmental engineering solutions and associated
    energy designs for public health protection and sustainable development. Fig.
    4.1 Roadmap for safe travel destinations and promotion of sustainable tourism
    at post-COVID-19 era Full size image Environmental management is a discipline
    concerned with the resources required by society. In an attempt to address growing
    environmental awareness, most industrial companies include investments in their
    plans that are directed toward the protection of the environment. It is necessary
    to manage environmental resources applying proper roadmap for sustainable designs
    in a way that promotes green circular economy so as to mitigate associated risks
    in tourism sector due to particular environmental impacts like climate change,
    environmental pollution, energy crisis, accidental facility attacks, global economic
    crisis, war conditions, pandemic circumstances in post COVID-19 era. Problems
    with the quality of a complicated environmental system arise when it is required
    to cover both its needs and the environmental effects of such a system, and this
    can become an environmental public health risk. Therefore, an improvement in the
    economic budget and monitoring of and proper project management of technical projects
    within environmental systems are necessary. Based on Fig. 4.1, efficient environmentally
    sustainable energy designs are necessary with right geoinformation utilities,
    risk assessment (RA) tools, sanitary drawings, monitoring schemes, life cycle
    analysis (LCA), quality assurance, econometrics, ICT’s utilities for circular
    economy in smart cities and proper geoinformatics tools for environmental ecosystem
    health for the update of industrial ecological health data and sustainable development
    in a circular economy. An integrated environmental ecological health policy should
    be focused on associated eco-health problems, providing solutions and right health
    studies to particular demographic and spatial datasets of our society. As the
    population increases, right designs are necessary for the sustainable progress
    of smart cities in a circular economy with our global society. Useful e-learning
    tools like ICTs are necessary, focused on safe measures at post-COVID-19 era for
    vocational education, creation of new jobs for all including refugees, gender
    equal opportunities and promotion of green tourism supporting effective community
    health tourism infrastructures with sport events and agritourism activities, protecting
    public health [3,4,5,6, 12,13,14, 16,17,18,19,20,21]. One important issue is the
    investment in sustainable designs supporting innovations in environmental technologies
    for public health protection and the sustainability of our society and its resources.
    Effective waste management schemes, landfill designs, waste water treatment designed
    units and emerging environmental technologies should be supported as a result
    of robust sustainable effective designs for public health protection and sustainability.
    Landfill emissions like biogas and treated leachates should be exploited properly
    so as to be used as goods for the society, promoting a sustainable development
    for new jobs in our society, supporting clean technologies, renewable resources
    for safe food productivity, sustainable mobility and public health protection
    [1, 6, 7, 11,12,13,14,15, 22,23,24]. 4.3 Solutions for Tourism in Crisis at Post-COVID-19
    Era An integrated environmental health policy is demanded for the sustainable
    development of our society. Community health centers and infrastructures associated
    with public health protection should follow the right strategic aims, guidelines,
    principles based on the next flowchart. In Fig. 4.1 is presented a useful flow
    chart for an integrated eco-health policy that supports green circular economy,
    innovative sustainable design solutions, safe green tourism infrastructures and
    associated energy designs for safe green travel destinations within public health
    protection and sustainable development. Nowadays, innovative energy systems, efficient
    construction management, monitoring schemes, supply chain project management and
    sustainable designs are necessary not only for the environmental protection of
    our planet but also for the sustainable development in smart cities and circular
    economy. Waste management is the discipline that is concerned with resources once
    society no longer requires them. It is necessary to manage the waste in a sustainable
    way by minimizing the environmental impacts related to waste. Solid waste disposal
    starts to be a problem when the amount and the environmental impacts of such disposal
    arise and become an environmental public health hazard. Then, the improvement
    of the management solid waste systems on a monitoring and spatial diagnosis base
    is necessary [2, 7, 14, 15]. The application of engineering mathematics in numerical
    models and their results in landfill emissions can be used for the determination
    of areas that are under risk for landfill gas emissions and leachates so as to
    take the right measures for safe community health tourism infrastructures and
    sustainable sports tourism facilities [11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 23]. Although the operation
    of efficient ecological environmental health projects and energy control systems
    is semantic, the environmental awareness campaigns should be organized to the
    public information for safe tourism infrastructures. Therefore, in such cases,
    there will be a public support to the installation of any necessary monitoring
    systems, associated sustainable designs, safe infrastructures for sustainable
    smart tourism destinations, efficient community health centers and effective eco-friendly
    sustainable designs for agritourism and sports activities [12,13,14,15]. Useful
    models in particular hydro-geotechnical green irrigation-drainage projects as
    well as in green tourism transportation energy solutions, green logistics transportation
    systems, clean technologies, green tourism buildings, are necessary for integrated
    sustainable development designs at associated alternative types of tourism and
    public health protection at post COVID-19 era [2, 12,13,14, 23]. Monitoring programs,
    efficient designs, emerging environmental technologies for health protection,
    right project management and field data are of great importance so as to set up
    utilities, taking into account useful numerical models based on case studies like
    the MACH one and its landfill gas and leachate emissions and others for soil oxidation.
    Right measures, activities should be taken into account based on environmental
    impact assessments, risk assessments for safe travel destinations, sports tourism
    facilities and agritourism infrastructures for sustainable community health tourism
    [11,12,13,14,15, 23]. Based on the above could be created particular new services—jobs
    for stakeholders, supported by proper e-learning, training web utilities for refugees,
    unemployed people related to sustainable health ecological tourism sector and
    associated alternative types of tourism so as to create new investments and jobs
    for tourism in global economic crisis. It is more important to determine expectations
    for professional improvement for graduates and stakeholders at all educational
    levels than it is to determine expectations for personal enrichment [1,2,3,4,
    6]. While the distance education environment is changing due to emerging ICT’s
    and IoT’s, Web utilities should be presented proper case studies to graduates
    and stakeholders so as to be useful not only at vocational education level or
    at their particular health and safety learning ones but also for their professional
    career level, meeting the demands of the market related to emerging environmental
    technologies within sustainable tourism opportunities for stakeholders and investors.
    Training tools using proper ICT’s and IoT’s could be applied as teacher that plays
    the most important role in the teaching process for students, graduates and stakeholders
    [4,5,6,7, 22, 25]. Proper technology should support trainers and teachers without
    replacing them. Students, graduates and stakeholders need trainers and teachers
    who act as guides, mentors, counselors and providing useful educational materials
    to students, supporting the relative operations management. One of the major goals
    of this study is to develop the presented planning guidelines and capacity guidelines
    that support an integrated safe cultural tourism in relation to ecological health
    sports tourism and particular economic instruments that create good experiences
    to tourists within safe infrastructures related to particular ecological sport
    tourism supply facilities, dance festival events as well as mountain trekking,
    sea sport events or river ones. Many opportunities exist for further research
    for creation of new jobs for women at cultural tourism. The link between cultural
    tourism, sport and ecological tourism in regional tourist Mediterranean countries
    is growing stronger, which could be reflected in tourist product design. This
    provides particular added values for stakeholders and investors for an integrated
    sustainable tourism development. Moreover, based on the above presented analysis,
    it is necessary to promote useful e-learning, ICTs training tools, Web project
    management utilities for vocational students, graduates and stakeholders within
    associated sectors related to safe travel destinations, taking the right measures
    for public health protection within tourism industry, construction industry, safe
    associated mobility infrastructures, sustainable port designs on islands and assistance
    at particular community health centers at emergencies in post-COVID-19 era. New
    opportunities are coming up for immigrants creating new jobs at several alternative
    types of tourism, and new opportunities for stakeholders and investors will exist.
    A proper planning is necessary for regional tourism development for how best to
    develop and market relative regional tourism travel at ecological attractions,
    at fabulous mountainous landscapes next to coast lines applying several activities
    of alternative types of tourism like Greek islands and other picturesque places
    at Mediterranean places. The results of this study will help to identify and overcome
    the key obstacles to the development of an integrated regional heritage, cultural
    tourism creating added values to associated alternative types of tourism, promoting
    local agricultural tourism food products, drinks and souvenirs. Integrated construction
    facilities should be encouraged in terms of empowerment of ecological health tourism,
    promote local monuments, religion tourism, battlefield tourism other alternative
    types of tourism and sports events or festivals between Mediterranean countries
    supporting cultural, heritage, environmental and public health protection at post-COVID-19
    era. 4.4 Eco-Health Policy for Air Pollutants Minimization from Transportation
    Infrastructures Geoinformatics tools are necessary for a qualitative eco-health
    policy of project management in road designs, associated hydraulic projects and
    utilities in transportation systems at ecosystems for the efficient sustainable
    designs in particular tourism infrastructures that are related to environmental
    eco-health quality, maintenance, right decision-making, policy-making and promotion
    of sustainability in efficient environmental technologies and facilities. Innovate
    hydraulic technologies should be supported where it is fissile so as to promote
    clean technologies for safe community health tourism infrastructures, sports tourism
    facilities at post-COVID-19 era. The outcomes of an efficient ecological and economical
    sustainable health tourism policy that supports clean emerging environmental technologies
    for healthcare protection within sports events and agritourism activities and
    hybrid smart renewable energy resources are useful for policy-makers, decision-makers,
    politicians, safety engineers, health inspectors, project managers and quality
    managers for monitoring, ISO managers and other stakeholders in quality assurance
    and operational environmental management process control of landfill emissions
    so as to protect public health from particular hazardous emissions. In this way,
    are determined the right capacities and the successful operational design of an
    integrated environmental management in sustainable smart cities facilities applying
    the right geoinformation, ICTs, IoTs, e-learning tools and drawings utilities
    for the good operation of circular economies supporting sustainability in tourism
    sector that is under crisis at post-COVID-19 era. Sanitary technologies protecting
    public health in urban community healthcare with efficient mobility in associated
    constructions for transportation infrastructures are necessary taking into account
    that they will operate properly also in emergencies [2, 11,12,13,14, 16,17,18,19,20,21,
    26]. Dynamic spatial models are necessary not only to evaluate associated risks
    and particular environmental indexes but also to demonstrate efficient sustainable
    designs that minimize any environmental impacts to receptors. Based on Fig. 4.2
    is presented an investigated framework for environmental and public health protection
    policy of a sustainable city within integrated waste management facilities and
    environmental management stakeholders applying properly environmental engineering
    tools to support agritourism events and sport events, minimizing operational costs
    at particular hotel infrastructures. Fig. 4.2 Framework for environmental and
    public health protection policy of a sustainable city for safe travel destinations
    within agritourism events and sport events supporting unique travel destinations
    at post-COVID-19 era Full size image 4.5 Conclusions Useful geoinformation ICT’s
    tools could be used in transportation infrastructures in smart logistics for safe
    and optimum supply chain project management of goods and protection of air quality,
    water quality and soil quality within associated ecological health facilities.
    The latter activities could include community healthcare centers at medical healthcare
    infrastructures or ecological tourism ones linked with other alternative types
    of tourism like agricultural tourism, sea tourism and medical sports. Useful construction
    designs and recycled materials should be developed for the above business opportunities
    in an integrated circular economy. Moreover, smart ICT’s in project management
    and quality assurance of sustainable projects should exist in eco-health infrastructures
    like clean energy and emerging environmental technologies for qualitative and
    safe travel destinations within community health tourism events for tourists protecting
    public health and community healthcare ecosystems from environmental pollution

    Privacy Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart agriculture IoT has become popular
    due to its advantages in automatic irrigation and fertilization, crop growth monitoring,
    and pest detection, etc [1, 2]. It is a typical application of IoT and is mostly
    the same as the traditional IoT in terms of architecture, protocol standards,
    wireless communication technology. Differently, to reduce waste of resources,
    minimize environmental impact, and maximize crop yields, most smart agricultural
    applications require to collect and process agricultural data in real-time. Meanwhile,
    the accurate geographical location and the geographical dimension of species are
    very important, which is a critical link in the production and circulation of
    agricultural products. With the widespread application of smart agriculture, the
    amount of agricultural data perceived by IoT devices will greatly increase. However,
    the computational and storage resources of the IoT devices are limited. To alleviate
    the computational and storage pressure on IoT devices and timely process the collected
    data, fog nodes are usually placed at the edge of the agricultural IoT to store
    data and process queries over the stored data [3,4,5,6,7]. Nevertheless, the fog
    node is at the edge of the agricultural IoT, and may not be completely trusted.
    If the data collected by the IoT device is directly exposed to the fog node, it
    will pose a privacy threat to the data [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. These potential privacy
    threats may result in an unproductive farming environment. For example, if the
    smart agriculture system is not working correctly, it could make a wrong decision
    based on the wrong data, such as over-fertilizing, or not irrigating dry land.
    Some researches on privacy protection have been conducted in the fields of energy,
    healthcare, or transportation [15,16,17,18,19]. However, few studies have focused
    on privacy threats in agriculture. To protect the privacy of agriculture data,
    the commonly used method is that the IoT devices first encrypt their collected
    data and then report them to the fog node. However, the encryption technique will
    inevitably affect data query functions. Among these query functions, the range-max
    query is one of the most common queries. The range-max query is to obtain the
    maximum data in a specific region. For clarity, we give an example of the range-max
    query as follows: Example 1 Suppose there are 4 × 4 agriculture IoT devices deployed
    in the whole field to monitor the growth of crops. Each IoT device is responsible
    for collecting crop growth data and reporting the data and its location to the
    fog node. And then, the fog node receives 16 triples, as shown in Fig. 1. For
    example, (16, 0, 0) represents that the data of the crop growth collected by the
    IoT device at location (0,0) is 16. When the query user wants to know the crop
    that grows best in the rectangular range Q = [1, 2] × [1, 2] marked with a red
    border in Fig. 1, he/she sends the query range Q to the fog node and will receive
    the maximum value 20 of the location (2,1) in that range returned by the fog node.
    Fig. 1 An example of the range-max query Full size image However, the range-max
    query over the ciphertext data is more challenging than that over plaintext data.
    To the best of our knowledge, existing works focus on either privacy-preserving
    max/min query or range query [20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. No previous work has addressed
    the privacy-preserving range-max queries in smart agriculture IoT. In response
    to this challenge, we present an efficient privacy-preserving range-max query
    scheme in fog-based smart agriculture IoT. The main contributions of this paper
    are fourfold as follows. First, we build the K2-treap which be used to store the
    data collected by agriculture IoT devices and support efficient range-max query
    and dynamic data update. Second, we design a data encryption and comparison algorithm
    based on BGN homomorphic encryption technique, which can not only securely compare
    two data based on their ciphertexts but also support the incremental updates directly
    over ciphertexts. Third, based on the K2-treap and our data encryption and comparison
    algorithm, we present an efficient privacy-preserving range-max query scheme.
    Notably, our comparison technique and range-max queries are run by the fog node,
    so there are no interactions between the agricultural IoT devices and the fog
    node during the comparison and query. Finally, we conduct a detailed security
    analysis, and the results show that the scheme we proposed can indeed protect
    privacy. Through performance evaluation, the experimental test results prove that
    our proposed scheme is efficient. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows.
    In Section 2, we describe our models, namely the system model and the security
    model, and the design goals. In Section 3, we introduce the preliminary. Then,
    we present our proposed scheme in Section 4. In Section 5 and Section 6, we conduct
    security analysis and performance evaluation respectively. Some related works
    are discussed in Section 7. Finally, we summarize our work and clarify the content
    of future research in Section 8. 2 Our models and design goals In this section,
    we first describe our models, namely the system model and the security model,
    and then propose our design goals. 2.1 System model Our system model with the
    privacy-preserving range-max query in the fog-based agricultural IoT is mainly
    composed of four types of entities, namely, service provider, agricultural IoT
    devices, fog node, and query user, as shown in Fig. 2. Service provider: The service
    provider is responsible for the whole system. To remotely monitor crop growth
    in the field, The service provider divides the filed evenly into 2n × 2n equal
    cells and deploys the agriculture IoT devices in each cell. Due to the limited
    storage space and computational capacity of the IoT devices, the service provider
    deploys a fog node at the edge of the agricultural IoT to help the IoT device
    complete data storage and processing. The data stored in the fog node is available
    for query from those users authorized by the service provider. Agriculture IoT
    devices: In the system, there are 2n × 2n IoT devices, and they are distributed
    in the whole field to monitor the growth of the crops. In specific, the IoT device
    Ix, y is distributed in the location (x, y) and responsible for collecting the
    data Dx, y of the cell (x, y), where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2n − 1 and Dx, y ∈ [0, l]. Let
    (Dx, y, x, y) denote a triple tuple of the IoT device Ix, y. Then, the data collected
    by all IoT devices can be denoted as \\({\\mathbb {D}} = \\{(D_{x,y}, x,y)| 0
    \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1)\\}\\). To prevent the fog node from knowing the collected
    data, each Ix, y encrypts the data Dx, y before sending it to the fog node. Thus,
    the fog node can receive an encrypted dataset \\([\\![ {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!] =
    \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)\\) |0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2n − 1} from all IoT devices, where
    ⟦Dx, y⟧ denotes the ciphertext of Dx, y. Fog node: When fog node receives encrypted
    dataset \\([\\![ {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!] = \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)\\) |0 ≤
    x, y ≤ 2n − 1} from all IoT devices, it can provide the range-max query service
    to query users. Specifically, when the fog node receives a range-max query request
    in the form of Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], it will search the encrypted dataset and
    return the encrypted maximum data, i.e., ⟦Dmax⟧, within the query rectangular
    range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], where \\(D_{max} = {\\max \\limits } \\{D_{x,y}|
    x_{1} \\leq x \\leq x_{2}; y_{1} \\leq y \\leq y_{2}\\}\\). In addition, the fog
    node allows agriculture IoT devices to dynamically update their data in ciphtexts.
    For example, when the agriculture IoT device Ix, y collects a new incremented
    data Dx, y′ at location (x, y), and it can send corresponding encrypted data \\([\\![
    D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) to the fog node. Then, the fog node will calculate
    \\([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!]\\cdot [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) to obtain \\([\\![
    D_{x,y} + D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) and use \\([\\![ D_{x,y} + D^{\\prime }_{x,y}
    ]\\!]\\) to update the value ⟦Dx, y⟧ on the location (x, y) node. Query user:
    The user must first register with the service provider to access the fog node.
    Then the service provider will assign a key to the registered user. Only those
    users authorized by the service provider can access the fog node for data queries.
    When the query user wants to know the crop that grows best in the rectangular
    range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], he/she sends the query range Q to the fog node
    and receives the maximum value ⟦Dmax⟧ in that range and the corresponding location
    (xmax, ymax), returned by the fog node. Finally, The query user uses the key to
    recover the Dmax from the encrypted ⟦Dmax⟧. Fig. 2 System model Full size image
    2.2 Security model In our security model, the service provider is considered trusted
    and is responsible for system initialization and key distribution. For the agriculture
    IoT devices, they are considered honest, and always keep in good condition, i.e.,
    they will follow the protocol sincerely and send the real encrypted value and
    the correct location \\([\\![ {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!]= \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)|
    0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1\\}\\) to the fog node. For the fog node, it is considered
    honesty-but-curious. That is, it will comply with the protocol to store or update
    the encrypted data ⟦Dx, y⟧ at the location (x, y), and run query algorithm correctly
    to respond to the authorized user’s range-max query. However, it may be curious
    about some private information, such as the plaintext of values from agriculture
    IoT devices and the corresponding query results of the authorized user. For the
    query users, they are honest, i.e., they will honestly comply with the protocol
    to submit the range-max queries. Besides, we assume that there is no collusion
    between query users and the fog node. This assumption is reasonable because the
    penalty of collusion for the involving fog node is very high, including losing
    the trust of users and being prosecuted. Of course, there may be active attacks
    such as damage to IoT devices. Since we are focusing on protecting privacy in
    this paper, the active attacks are no longer within the scope of this article,
    and it will be our work in the future. 2.3 Design goals Based on the system model
    described in Section 2.1 and the security model described in Section 2.2, we present
    an efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query scheme. In particular, the
    following two goals should be achieved. Privacy protection: Privacy protection
    is the basic requirement of our paper. That is to say, the data collected by IoT
    devices and the corresponding query results of query users should be kept confidential
    from the fog node. Dynamic update: In addition to privacy protection requirements,
    the proposed scheme should also support the dynamic update of IoT devices’ data
    in the ciphertext. Specifically, when the data collected by IoT devices Ix, y
    changes, the proposed scheme should support the fog node to dynamically update
    corresponding encrypted data ⟦Dx, y⟧ stored in it. 3 Preliminary In this section,
    we will outline some knowledge related to our proposed scheme, namely the bilinear
    pairing with composite order and the BGN homomorphic encryption[27]. 3.1 Bilinear
    pairing with composite order Let N = pq, where p, q are two different large prime
    numbers of the same length. \\(\\mathbb {G}\\) and \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\) are
    two multiplicative cyclic groups with composite order N. The group can be instantiated
    by the elliptic curve addition group. The bilinear map can be computed in polynomial
    time. We assume that the discrete logarithm problems in both \\(\\mathbb {G}\\)
    and \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\) are hard. If the map \\(e : \\mathbb {G} \\times \\mathbb
    {G} \\to \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\) has the following properties, this map is called
    bilinear map with composite order. Bilinearity: For any \\((g, h) \\in \\mathbb
    {G} \\times \\mathbb {G}\\) and \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\), we have e(ga,
    hb) = e(g, h)ab; Non-degeneracy: There is a generator \\(g \\in \\mathbb {G}\\),
    so that e(g, g) is with the order N in \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\). At the same time,
    e(g, g) is a generator of \\( \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\). Computability: For all \\((g,
    h) \\in \\mathbb {G}\\), there is an algorithm that can efficiently compute \\(e(g,
    h) \\in \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\). Definition 1 Composite Bilinear Generator Let \\({\\mathcal
    {C}\\mathcal {G}}{en}\\) be a composite bilinear parameter generator, and κ is
    a security parameter. According to the following process, the \\({\\mathcal {C}\\mathcal
    {G}}{en}\\) can output a 5-tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, g, e)\\)
    in probability polynomial time. (1) Let N = pq, where p, q are two randomly generated
    κ-bit prime numbers. (2) Generate two groups \\(\\mathbb {G}\\), \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\)
    with order N, and select a generator g for \\(\\mathbb {G}\\). Then, construct
    a bilinear map \\(e: \\mathbb {G} \\times \\mathbb {G} \\to \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\)
    as mentioned above. (3) Output the parameters \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T},
    g,e)\\). Let g be a generator of \\(\\mathbb {G}\\), then \\(\\mathbf {g} = g^{q}
    \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) can construct the subgroup \\(\\mathbb {G}_{p} = \\{ \\mathbf
    {g}^{0}, \\mathbf {g}^{1}, \\cdots , \\mathbf {g}^{p-1}\\}\\) with order p, and
    \\(\\mathbf {g}^{\\prime } = g^{p} \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) can construct the subgroup
    \\(\\mathbb {G}_{q} = \\{\\mathbf {g}^{\\prime 0}, \\mathbf {g}^{\\prime 1}, \\cdots
    , \\mathbf {g}^{\\prime q-1} \\}\\) with order q in \\(\\mathbb {G}\\). Given
    a tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, e, h)\\), determining whether h
    is in the subgroup \\(\\mathbb {G}_{q}\\) is called the SubGroup Decision (SGD)
    Problem, where \\(h \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) or \\(h \\in \\mathbb {G}_{q}\\). Since
    the SGD problem is hard [28], it can be ensured that the following BGN homomorphic
    encryption is safe. 3.2 BGN Homomorphic encryption The BGN is a popular homomorphic
    public-key encryption that was originally proposed by Boneh, Goh, and Nissim in
    [27]. It includes three phases: key generation, encryption, and decryption. Key
    Generation: Let κ be the security parameter, the generator \\(\\mathcal {C}\\mathcal
    {{G}}{en}\\) outputs a 5-tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, g,e)\\),
    where the 5 parameters are described as above. Let h = gq, and it can construct
    a subgroup of \\({\\mathbb {G}}\\) of order p. That is, h is a random generator.
    Therefore, the public key is \\(pk = (N, {\\mathbb {G}}, {\\mathbb {G}}_{T}, g,
    e, h)\\), and the private key is sk = p. Encryption: Assuming that the message
    space is \\(\\mathbb {S} = \\{0, 1, \\cdots , T \\}\\), where T ≪ q. Use \\(C=
    E(m) = g^{m} h^{r} \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) to encrypt a message \\(m \\in \\mathbb
    {S}\\), where \\(r \\in {\\mathbb {Z}}_{N}\\) is a random number. Decryption:
    Given a ciphertext C = E(m), the plaintext m can be recovered in the following
    two steps. (1) Compute Cp = (gmhr)p = (gp)m. (2) Let \\(\\hat {g} = g^{p}\\),
    recover m from (gp)m by computing the discrete log of Cp base \\(\\hat {g}\\)
    with the Pollard’s lambda method [29]. Based on the SubGroup Decision(SGD) Problem
    assumption, BGN is provably secure against chosen-plaintext attacks. For the detailed
    security analysis please refer to [27]. BGN encryption has the following homomorphic
    properties. Addition: Given E(m1) and E(m2), we have \\(E(m_{1}) \\cdot E(m_{2})
    \\rightarrow E(m_{1} + m_{2})\\). Multiplication-I: Given E(m1) and m2, we have
    \\(E(m_{1})^{m_{2}} \\rightarrow E(m_{1}\\cdot m_{2})\\). Self-Blinding: Given
    E(m1) and \\(h^{r_{2}}\\), we have \\(E(m_{1}) \\cdot h^{r_{2}} \\rightarrow E(m_{1})\\).
    Multiplication-II: Given E(m1) and E(m2), we have \\(e(E(m_{1}), E(m_{2}))\\rightarrow
    E^{\\prime }(m_{1}\\cdot m_{2}) \\in \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\), where \\(E^{\\prime
    }()\\) represents a ciphertext in \\({\\mathbb {G}}_{T}\\). 4 Our proposed scheme
    In this section, we present our efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query
    scheme in fog-based agricultural IoT. Before going into details, we first introduce
    a tree structure, called K2-treap, and a privacy-preserving encryption scheme,
    a privacy-preserving comparison protocol, which are several important components
    of our proposed scheme. 4.1 The K2-treap The K2-treap is a quadtree structure
    and also has the max heap property. Specifically, each internal node in the K2-treap
    has four children, and the value of child nodes is less than that of their parent
    node. With the max heap property, the K2-treap can effectively support the range-max
    query. In the following, we will introduce three algorithms about the K2-treap
    including tree building, dynamic update, and range-max query. 4.1.1 Tree building
    Suppose that the dataset \\(\\mathbb {D}\\) is a location-based dataset, and it
    is in the form of \\(\\mathbb {D} = \\{(D_{x,y}, x,y)| 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1)\\}\\),
    where (x, y) is a location and Dx, y is the value in (x, y), as shown in Fig.
    3. Based on the dataset \\(\\mathbb {D}\\), we can build a K2-treap KT from bottom
    to top as follows. Step 1: Build the leaf nodes of the K2-treap KT. Specifically,
    for each value \\(D_{x,y} \\in \\mathbb {D}\\), build a leaf node (Dx, y, x, y).
    Thus, the side length of the area covered by each leaf node can be denoted as
    L = 20. Step 2: Build the higher level of the K2-treap KT based on the leaf nodes.
    As shown in Fig. 3, from the upper-left node of the whole area, we can gradually
    merge four leaf nodes in a square into an internal node. In the internal node,
    it contains 7 attributes {AID,CID, c1, c2, c3, c4, p}. AID is used to describe
    the area that is covered by the current node. The area is a square and it can
    be denoted as AID = (xleft, ytop, L), where (xleft, ytop) is the upper-left location
    of the area, and L is the side length of the area. In this level, since there
    are 2 × 2 values in the area of the square, the side length of the area is L =
    21. CID is used to describe the max value and its corresponding location of this
    area. It can be denoted as CID = (data, x, y), where data is the max value in
    this square, i.e., \\(data = \\max \\limits \\{D_{x,y}|x \\in [x_{left},x_{left}
    + L], y \\in [ y_{top},y_{top} + L]\\}\\), and (x, y) is the location of data.
    For c1, c2, c3, c4, they are pointers to the children of the current internal
    node. Without loss of generality, we assume that c1, c2, c3, c4 respectively point
    to the upper-left node, upper-right node, lower-left node, and lower-right node
    of this area. Meanwhile, the internal node has a pointer p that points to its
    parent, and it will be assigned when the next higher level is built. When constructing
    this level, we let the parent pointers of the leaf nodes in this area point to
    the current internal node. Step 3: Build the next higher level of the K2-treap
    KT based on the internal nodes constructed in step 2. From the upper-leaf node,
    gradually merge four internal nodes in a square into an internal node and assign
    the attributes of the internal node with the same method in step 2. Differently,
    in this level, the area covered by each internal node contains 22 × 22 values,
    the side length of the square is L = 22. Step 4: Repeat step 3 until there is
    only one merged node, i.e., the root node. After this step, a K2-treap KT is constructed.
    Fig. 3 The K2-treap structure Full size image Example 2 There is a dataset with
    4 × 4 elements. We can use the dataset to build the K2-treap KT, as shown in Fig.
    4. The building process of the KT is as follows: Step 1: Build the leaf nodes
    of the KT. Each element of the dataset can be used to build the leaf node of the
    KT. At the same time, the side length of the area is L = 20. Step 2: Build the
    higher level of the KT based on the leaf nodes. From the upper-left node of the
    whole area, we gradually merge four leaf nodes in a square into an internal node,
    and obtain 2 × 2 internal nodes. The value of each internal node is the maximum
    data of the current square. The CID of the four internal nodes are (16,0,0),(9,0,3),(20,2,1),(21,2,3).The
    AID of the four internal nodes are (0,0, L = 21),(0,2, L = 21),(2,0, L = 21),
    (2,2, L = 21). Each internal node’s four child-pointers c1, c2, c3, c4 respectively
    point to the upper-left node, upper-right node, lower-left node, and lower-right
    node of this area. At the same time, the side length of the area is L = 21. Step
    3: Build the next higher level of the KT based on the internal nodes constructed
    in Step 2, we merge the four internal nodes in a square. There is only one merged
    node, which is the root node of the KT. The AID of the root node is (0,0, L =
    22), the CID of the root node is (21,2,3). In this case, we can get the maximum
    data 21 of the whole dataset and the corresponding location (2,3) from the CID
    of the root node. Fig. 4 An example of K2-treap building Full size image 4.1.2
    Range-max Query When the K2-treap KT is built, it can efficiently support range-max
    query. In specific, given a query range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], we can search
    KT to find out the maximum value among all values within the range Q, i.e., \\(D_{max}
    = \\max \\limits \\{D_{x,y}| (x,y) \\in Q\\}\\). The query process can be performed
    as the following steps. Step 1: Initialize a stack S = ∅, Dmax = 0, (xmax, ymax)
    = (0,0). The stack will be used to store the selected nodes whose AID intersects
    with Q. Dmax represents the maximum value in the range Q, (xmax, ymax) is the
    location where the maximum value locates in. Step 2: Push the root node of the
    KT into the stack. Step 3: If the stack is not empty, pop a node from the stack,
    and denote it by N. If the location (x, y) of the N.CID is in the query range
    Q and the data N.CID.data is larger than Dmax, then update Dmax and (xmax, ymax).
    If the location (x, y) of the node N.CID is not in the query range Q, we select
    its child-nodes whose AID has an intersection with Q and push them into the stack
    S. Step 4: Repeat Step 3, until the stack is empty. Note that, the query area
    Q in the algorithm is a regular rectangle, the algorithm can query the maximum
    value of any irregular region, as any irregular region can ultimately be made
    up of multiple cells. 4.1.3 Dynamic update When the value Dx, y of the node N
    at the location (x, y) in the K2-treap KT has changed, the incremented value is
    \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\). The KT can be dynamically updated by comparing the value
    of the node with the value of its parent. The dynamical update process of the
    KT is as follows: Step 1: Jump from the root node to the corresponding location
    of the node N in the leaf node according to the (x, y); Step 2: Update the data
    Dx, y of the node’s N.CID with new data \\(D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\). Step
    3: Compare the data N.CID.data with the data N.p.CID.data, If the data N.CID.data
    > N.p.CID.data, then update the N.p.CID.data with the N.CID.data, and use N to
    represent the parent node. Step 4: Repeat Step 3, until the node is root or N.CID.data
    ≤ N.p.CID.data. 4.2 The data encryption and comparison technique In this subsection,
    we present data encryption and comparison technique, which can achieve data encryption
    and encrypted data comparison. This technique is based on BGN homomorphic encryption
    technique, and it involves three parties, i.e., data encryptor, data decryptor,
    and data comparator. The data encryptor is responsible for encrypting the data.
    The data comparator can achieve encrypted data comparison. The decryptor can recover
    plaintexts from encrypted data. In specific, our data encryption and data comparison
    protocol technique consist of four algorithms, i.e., key generation, encryption,
    decryption, and data comparison. Key generation: Let κ be the security parameter,
    the key generation algorithm first outputs a 5-tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb
    {G}_{T}, g, e)\\) by running \\({\\mathcal {C}\\mathcal {G}}{en}(\\kappa )\\),
    where N = pq. Then, let h = gq, the BGN public key is \\(pk = (N, {\\mathbb {G}},
    {\\mathbb {G}}_{T}, g, e, h)\\), and the private key is sk = p. Further, the algorithm
    selects a hash function \\(H : \\{0, 1\\}^{*} \\to {\\mathbb {Z}}_{N}\\), and
    also selects two secret keys \\(s, t \\in {\\mathbb {Z}}_{N}\\). In addition,
    to enable the data comparator to compare encrypted data, the key generation algorithm
    generates a set of hash values \\({\\mathbb {H}} = \\{H(e(g, g)^{pstx}) | x \\in
    (0, l]\\}\\). Finally, the key generation algorithm respectively distributes gs,
    (s− 1p), and \\((g^{pt}, {\\mathbb {H}})\\) to the encryptor, decryptor, and data
    comparator. Meanwhile, it publishes the public key pk, and hash function H. Encryption:
    Given a plaintext m ∈ (0, l], the data encryptor can encrypt m as $$ [\\![ m ]\\!
    ]= E(m)= (g^{s})^{m} \\cdot h^{r} $$ (1) where \\(r \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\) is
    a random number. Decryption: Given a ciphertext ⟦m⟧ = E(m), the decryptor first
    computes $$ \\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} {[\\![ m ]\\!]}^{s^{-1}p} = {((g^{s})^{m}}
    \\cdot {h^{r}})^{s^{-1}p}= (g^{p})^{m}. \\end{array} $$ (2) Then, the decryptor
    can recover m from (gp)m by computing the discrete log of (gp)m base gp with the
    Pollard’s lambda method [29]. Data comparison: Given two encrypted data ⟦m1⟧ and
    ⟦m2⟧, the data comparator can compare them. Specifically, the data comparator
    first computes $$ \\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} X = e\\left( \\frac{[\\![ m_{1} ]\\!]}{[\\![
    m_{2} ]\\!]}, g^{pt} \\right) = e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})} \\end{array} $$ (3)
    Then, if \\(X = 1_{\\mathbb {G}_{T}}\\), we can directly have m1 = m2. If \\(H(X)
    \\in \\mathbb {H}\\), m1 > m2. Otherwise, m1 < m2. Correctness. The correctness
    of the data encryption and comparison technique is follows: Assume ⟦m1⟧ and ⟦m2⟧
    are two encrypted values, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{[\\![ m_{1} ]\\!]}{[\\![m_{2}
    ]\\!]} &= \\frac{{(g^{s})^{m_{1}}} \\cdot h^{r_{1}}}{{(g^{s})^{m_{2}} }\\cdot
    h^{r_{2}}}\\\\ &={ g^{s(m_{1}-m_{2})}} \\cdot h^{r_{1}-r_{2}} \\end{aligned} $$
    Then, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} X &= e\\left( \\frac{[\\![m_{1} ]\\!]}{[\\![m_{2}
    ]\\!]}, g^{pt}\\right) = e(g^{s(m_{1}-m2)}\\cdot h^{r_{1} -r_{2}}, g^{pt})\\\\
    &= e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})} \\cdot e(h, g)^{pt(r_{1} -r_{2})}\\\\ &= e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})}
    \\cdot 1 = e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})} \\end{aligned} $$ Clearly, if m1 − m2 > 0,
    i.e. m1 > m2, then m1 − m2 ∈ (0, l] and we know H(X) will appear in \\(\\mathbb
    {H}\\). if \\(X = 1_{\\mathbb {G}_{T}}\\), we can directly have m1 = m2. If m1
    < m2, H(Xi) will not appear in \\(\\mathbb {H}\\). Therefore, the correctness
    of the data encryption and comparison technique holds. 4.3 The details of our
    scheme In this subsection, we present our privacy-preserving range-max query scheme,
    which contains four phases, i.e., system initialization, data transmission, range-max
    query, and dynamic update. 4.3.1 System initialization In the system initialization,
    the service provider is responsible for bootstrapping the whole scheme.As the
    key generation algorithm in Section 4.2, the service provider generates the public
    pk and the private key sk, where \\(pk = (N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, e,
    g, h)\\), sk = p. Further, the service provider chooses a cryptographic hash function
    \\(H : \\{0, 1\\}^{*} \\to \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\), and two secret keys \\(s, t \\in
    \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\). Finally, the service provider keeps (p, s, t) secretly, respectively
    distributes gs, (s− 1p), and \\((g^{pt}, \\mathbb {H})\\) to the IoT devices,
    the authorized query use, and fog node. Meanwhile, it publishes the public key
    pk, and hash function H. The hash function is constructed as described in Section
    4.2. 4.3.2 Data transmission In this phase, The IoT device transmits its data
    to the fog node as follows: Step 1: IoT device Ix, y uses gs and a random number
    \\(r_{x,y} \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N} \\) to encrypt Dx, y as $$ \\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    [\\![D_{x,y}]\\!] =E(D_{x,y})= (g^{s})^{D_{x,y}} \\cdot h^{r_{x,y}} \\end{array}
    $$ (4) where \\(r_{x,y} \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N}, 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1, D_{x,y}
    \\in {\\mathbb {D}}\\). Step 2: IoT device Ix, y sends the encrypted data ⟦Dx,
    y⟧ and corresponding location (x, y) to the fog node. Step 3: From all IoT devices,
    the fog node receives an encrypted dataset \\([\\![{\\mathbb {D}}]\\!] = \\{([\\![D_{x,y}]\\!],
    x,y)| 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1)\\}\\). Based on the encrypted dataset, the fog
    node builds a K2-treap KT as described in Section 4.1.1. Since the fog node cannot
    access the plaintext dataset \\({\\mathbb {D}}\\), it will face a challenge, that
    is how to compare the sizes of these encrypted data. For solving the challenge,
    the fog node can run privacy-preserving data comparisons described in Section
    4.2. In this case, the node in the KT contains 7 attributes {AID,CID, c1, c2,
    c3, c4, p} as described in Section 4.1.1. The only difference is that the data
    of the CID is encrypted. 4.3.3 Range-max query When the KT is built by fog node,
    it can efficiently support range-max query over the encrypted data as follows:
    Step 1: If an authorized query user wants to know which crops grow best in a range,
    it needs to send the query range Q to the fog node, where Q = [x1, x2] × [y1,
    y2]. Step 2: The fog node runs the range-max query algorithm as described in Section
    4.1. Due to the data of the node’s CID in the KT is encrypted, it is a challenge
    for the fog node to compare ⟦Dmax⟧ < ⟦N.CID.data⟧. In this case, the fog node
    needs to run privacy-preserving data comparisons described in Section 4.2, then
    returns the maximum encrypted value⟦Dmax⟧and corresponding location xmax, ymax
    to the authorized query user. i.e., \\([\\![D_{max} ]\\!]= \\max \\limits \\{
    [\\![D_{x,y}]\\!]|\\) (x, y) ∈ Q}. Step 3: Once the query user receives the value⟦Dmax⟧
    and location xmax, ymax, he/she can use the key (s− 1p) assigned by the service
    provider to perform the following calculation. $$ \\begin{aligned} ({[\\![ {\\mathbb{D}}_{max}
    ]\\!]})^{s^{-1}p}=((g^{s})^{D_{max}} \\cdot h^{r})^{(s^{-1} p)}=(g^{p})^{D_{max}}
    \\end{aligned} $$ Let \\(\\hat {g} = g^{p}\\). It can recover Dmax from ⟦Dmax⟧
    by computing the discrete log of (\\({[\\![D_{max}]\\!]})^{s^{-1}p}\\) base \\(\\hat
    {g}\\) with the Pollard’s lambda method [29]. 4.3.4 Dynamic update When the agriculture
    IoT device monitors that the value at the location (x, y) has changed, the incremented
    value is \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\). The K2-treap KT can be dynamically updated
    by fog node as follows: Step 1: IoT device Ix, y first encrypts the value \\(D^{\\prime
    }_{x,y}\\) using the data encryption algorithm as described in Section 4.2, then
    sends the ciphertext \\([\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) and the corresponding
    location (x, y) to fog node. Step 2: When the fog node receives the encrypted
    data \\( [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) and location x, y, it first computes
    \\( [\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!] \\cdot [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\), then obtains
    the encrypted data \\([\\![ D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) according to
    the additional property of the BGN homomorphic encryption. Step 3: Since the fog
    node only knows the encrypted data of the node CID, it will face a challenge,
    that is how to compare ⟦N.CID.data⟧ > ⟦N.p.CID.data]], where N represents the
    node with the value \\([\\![D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) at the location
    (x, y). For solving the challenge, the fog node can run privacy-preserving data
    comparisons described in Section 4.2 . Step 4: Repeat Step 3, until the node is
    root or ⟦N.CID.data⟧ ≤ ⟦N.p.CID.data⟧. 5 Security analysis In this section, we
    will conduct the security analysis of our proposed privacy-preserving range-max
    query scheme. Since the privacy-preserving data encryption and privacy-preserving
    comparison technique are two important components of our scheme, we first analyze
    their security. After that, we conduct the security analysis of our proposed scheme.
    5.1 Security of data encryption and comparison technique Our data encryption and
    comparison technique consist of data encryption and data comparison algorithm.
    In the following, we show that both of them are secure. For our data encryption
    technique, the data is encrypted as ⟦m⟧ = E(m) = (gs)m ⋅ hr. It is very similar
    to the BGN homomorphic encryption scheme, in which a data m is encrypted as ⟦m⟧
    = E(m) = (g)m ⋅ hr. Since BGN encryption scheme is semantically secure, our encryption
    technique is also semantically secure. Meanwhile, compared with BGN encryption
    technique, our encryption technique involves an additional secret key s, so our
    scheme is even more secure. Thus, our data encryption technique is secure and
    it is hard to recover the plaintext m without the private key s− 1p. For our data
    comparison algorithm, given two encrypted data \\({[\\![ m_{1} ]\\!]} = (g^{s})^{m_{1}}
    \\cdot {h^{r}}\\), \\({[\\![ m_{2} ]\\!]} = (g^{s})^{m_{2}} \\cdot {h^{r}}\\),
    the data comparator can use the key gpt to compute \\(X = e\\left (\\frac {[\\![m_{1}
    ]\\!]}{[\\![m_{2} ]\\!]}, g^{pt}\\right )\\) \\(= e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})}\\).
    Then, the data comparator can deduce the comparison relationship between m1 and
    m2 by computing H(X) and judging whether H(X) is in the \\({\\mathbb {H}}\\).
    If \\(X =1_{\\mathbb {G}_{T}}\\), the data comparator can directly have m1 = m2.
    Actually, the data comparison algorithm pursues the comparison of data on basis
    of protecting privacy, so the comparison relationship cannot be regarded as private
    information. However, the data comparator cannot have access to the plaintext
    of m1 − m2. This is because the data comparator has no idea on the secret key
    s, it is hard for it to recover the plaintext m1 − m2 from \\(e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})}\\).
    Thus, the data comparison algorithm is secure. 5.2 Security of our proposed scheme
    In our security model described in Section 2.2, we assume that there is no collusion
    between the fog node and the query user. That is the query user will not share
    the key s− 1p assigned by the service provider with the fog node. Based on this
    assumption, we will confirm that our proposed scheme can achieve the privacy-preserving
    properties, i.e. (1) The dataset \\({\\mathbb {D}}\\) is privacy-preserving; (2)
    The query result Dmax is privacy-preserving; (3) The updated data is privacy-preserving.
    The dataset \\({\\mathbb {D}}\\) is privacy-preserving: In our scheme, IoT device
    Ix, y first encrypts data as \\( [\\![D_{x,y}]\\!] = (g^{s})^{D_{x,y}} \\cdot
    h^{r_{x,y}} ,0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1\\), and then sends ⟦Dx, y⟧ to the fog node.
    Thus, the fog node can access an encrypted dataset \\([\\![{\\mathbb {D}}]\\!]\\).
    Since our data encryption technique is semantically secure, the fog node can not
    recover Dx, y from ⟦Dx, y⟧ of the encrypted dataset \\([\\![{\\mathbb {D}}]\\!]\\)
    without knowing the decryption key s− 1p. As a result, the dataset \\({\\mathbb
    {D}}\\) is privacy-preserving. The query result Dmax is privacy-preserving: In
    our scheme, given a query range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], the fog node can find
    the maximum encrypted value ⟦Dmax⟧ in this query range and return it. Because
    \\(D_{max} \\in {\\mathbb {D}}\\) is encrypted like \\( [\\![D_{max}]\\!] = (g^{s})^{D_{max}}
    \\cdot h^{r_{x,y}}\\), and our data encryption and comparison algorithm is secure,
    the fog node can not recover the Dmax from ⟦Dmax⟧ without the decryption key s− 1p.
    The Dmax in range Q is privacy-preserving. The updated data is privacy-preserving:
    In our scheme, once the fog node receives a new encrypted incremented value \\(
    [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) at location (x, y) from the I(x, y), the fog
    node first computes \\( [\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!] \\cdot [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]
    \\) to obtain the encrypted data \\([\\![ D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\),
    then uses \\([\\![D^{\\prime }_{x,y}+D_{x,y}]\\!]\\) to update the original value
    ⟦Dx, y⟧ at the location (x, y) in the K2-treap. Because \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}
    \\in {\\mathbb {D}}\\) is encrypted like \\( [\\![D^{\\prime }_{x,y}]\\!] = (g^{s})^{D^{\\prime
    }_{x,y}} \\cdot h^{r_{x,y}}\\), and our data encryption and comparison algorithm
    is secure, the fog node can not recover the \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\) from \\([\\![D^{\\prime
    }_{x,y}[\\!]\\) without the decryption key s− 1p. Therefore, the updated data
    is secret to the fog node. 6 Performance evaluation In this section, we evaluate
    the performance of the range-max query scheme by using the time for the fog node
    to complete the update of K2 -treap and the time of the range-max query. To the
    best of our knowledge, existing works either focus on privacy-preserving range
    query, top-k query, or max query. No previous work has addressed the privacy-preserving
    range-max queries in smart agriculture IoT. Therefore we compare our proposed
    scheme(w/ K2-treap) with the scheme without integrating the K2-treap(w/o K2-treap).
    6.1 Experimental setting We use JAVA to implement our scheme, and run our experiments
    on a machine with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @2.30GHz, 10GB RAM, and Debian 9 operating
    system. For our scheme, the corresponding parameters are as follows: The encryption
    algorithm’s security parameter κ is 512 bits. The length of the p, q is 512-bit,
    and the length of N is 1024. The numbers of the agriculture IoT devices are 2n
    × 2n, where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The fog node receives an encrypted dataset \\([\\![
    {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!] = \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)| 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1\\}\\)
    from all IoT devices, where Dx, y ∈ [0, l], l = 500. We run our experiments 22n− 1
    K2-treap updates and 50 range-max queries. 6.2 Experimental results 6.2.1 Update
    time As the scheme without integrating K2-treap does not involve an update procedure,
    we mainly focus on the update time for our proposed scheme. In our experiments,
    the update of K2-treap is performed by randomly generating the location (x, y)
    and the incremented value \\(0\\leq D^{\\prime }_{x,y} \\leq 10\\), where 0 ≤
    x, y ≤ 2n − 1, n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. After running 22n− 1 times of updating the
    K2-treap, the statistical results of the updating time is shown in Fig. 5. In
    specific, the dots linked by the green lines represent the average update times
    for varied n, and each violin plot in the diagram has the following properties:
    The bottom and top of the thick black line represent the first and third quartile
    of the data, respectively. The white circle inside each violin denotes the second
    quartile of data. The lowest (resp. highest) datum within the 1.5 interquartile
    range (IQR) of the first (resp. third) quartile is marked by the lower (resp.
    upper) whisker. The grey shades show the probability density of the data at different
    values. Fig. 5 Update time of K2-treap. In this figure, each gray shade indicates
    the update times’ distribution for the corresponding value of n, which shows that
    the upper bound of the update time increases with n. However, the green line shows
    the average update time, which decreases as n increases Full size image For example,
    when n = 3, there are 2n × 2n = 64 data collected by the IoT devices. The K2-treap
    has 64 leaf nodes and its depth is 4, and we run 22n− 1 = 32 updates on the K2-treap.
    Experimental results show that among 32 updates, a quarter of the updates (8 times)
    can be completed in 551.5ms, half of them (16 times) can be completed in 706.4ms,
    and three-quarters (24 times) in 987.9ms finish. In Fig. 5, the bottom, white
    circle, and top of the black box are used to represent them. Meanwhile, the green
    point represents the average time consumption of 32 updates, which is 759.7 ms.
    The other points linked by the green lines represent the average update time when
    n is 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. They are 722.9ms, 763.8ms, 763.4ms, 538.8ms, and 435.9ms,
    respectively. The average time consumption for updating the K2-treap is less than
    800 ms. As shown in Fig. 5, although in rare cases the update time is relatively
    long. This is mainly because that, the upper bound of update time is linear to
    the depth of the K2-treap, which will increase with n. However, as n increases,
    the possibility of updating the same cell decreases, and the frequency of updates
    involving operating internal nodes decreases. Therefore, the average time consumption
    of the update phase decreases as n increases. 6.2.2 Query time To compare the
    query performance, we test the average time consumption for the two schemes to
    handle queries of varied areas ranging from 0.1 × 22n to 1.2 × 22n, and for each
    area of the query range, we randomly generate 50 queries. The average time consumption
    for maximum queries in different query ranges of the two schemes are shown in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Average time consumption for range-max queries of different query
    ranges. In this figure, the average query time of our proposed scheme decreases
    as the area of the query range increases, while that of the scheme without integrating
    the K2-treap is linear to the query range’s area Full size image In the scheme
    without integrating K2-treap, as the query range expands, the number of IoT devices
    within the query range also increases. To find the maximum value in the query
    range, the compared data will also increase. Therefore, the query time of the
    scheme will also increase. The query time of the scheme is related to the numbers
    of data collected by the IoT devices in the query range, therefore the average
    time consumption of the scheme is linear to the area of the query range. However,
    in our scheme(w/ K2-treap), each internal node in the K2-treap has four children,
    and the value of child nodes is less than that of their parent node. With the
    max heap property, the query time of our scheme will not increase with the increase
    of the query range. Specifically, when the query range covers the whole field,
    the data of the root of the K2-treap is the maximum value in the query range.
    The query time of our scheme is a very small constant. Therefore our scheme is
    much better than the scheme without integrating the K2-treap(w/o K2-treap). The
    average time consumption for our proposed scheme reduces as the query range’s
    area increases and is less than 10 seconds. 7 Related works To the best of our
    knowledge, existing works focus on either privacy-preserving max/min query [20,21,22]
    or range query [23,24,25,26], and have little work on privacy-preserving range-max
    queries in smart agriculture IoT. In the following, we introduce some related
    works that are close to our work. Some privacy-preserving max/min query schemes
    [20,21,22] have been proposed. Yao et al. [20] are the first to consider the privacy
    max/min query in two-tiered sensor networks. They use the prefix membership verification
    approach to encode sensor data. The proposed scheme can not only ensure the storage
    node to correctly process max/min queries over encoded data but also prevent the
    storage node from knowing the actual values. Since all sensors in this scheme
    share the same key, the data privacy could be leaked if a sensor is compromised.
    Thus, the security of this scheme is weak. Samanthula et al. [21] adopted the
    GM (Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali) probabilistic encryption to protect data
    privacy even if a few sensors are compromised. Since every bit of the data collected
    by a sensor is encrypted into a vector whose length is equal to the domain size
    of the collected data, the network communication cost may become very large if
    the domain size of the collected data is large. Thus, this scheme is communication
    inefficient. Dai et al. [22] are the first to discuss privacy-preserving max/min
    query (PMQ) processing for the WSN-as-a-Service environment based on the secure
    multi-party computation. The communication cost of their PMQ scheme is lower than
    that of the schemes in [20, 21]. Nevertheless, all schemes above have multiple
    rounds of interactions between sensors during query processing. In addition, these
    schemes focus on obtaining the max/min value of all encrypted data in the whole
    region, and none of them consider the range query in a specific region. Some privacy-preserving
    range query schemes [23,24,25,26] have been proposed. The privacy-preserving range
    query is to obtain the data in a specific region while preserving the privacy
    of the query range and query result. Agrawal et al. [23] first presented the order-preserving
    encryption(OPE) technique that supports range queries over encrypted data. Boldyreva
    et al. [24] gave an efficient OPE implementation for a range query protocol. However,
    since the OPE technique essentially leaks the order information of the data, this
    scheme discloses the frequency of each different value in the dataset and is vulnerable
    to statistical attacks. Besides, this scheme cannot support the incremental update
    directly over ciphertexts. Lu [25] and Mahdikhani et al. [26] respectively proposed
    a new privacy-preserving range query scheme based on the homomorphic encryption
    technique. Both of the proposed schemes in [25, 26] focus on the scenario of the
    fog-enhanced IoT and can achieve range queries while preserving the privacy of
    IoT devices’ plaintext data and users’ query range. However, these schemes involve
    many interactions between the fog node and the IoT devices during the query process.
    Lu [25] reorganized range query by using range query expression, decomposition,
    and composition technique to achieve \\(O(\\sqrt {n})\\) communication. Mahdikhani
    et al. [26] proposed a novel range decomposition technique to compile the range
    query to achieve \\(O(\\log ^{3} n)\\) communication. Different from the above
    existing schemes, we focus on the range-max query, and propose an efficient and
    privacy-preserving range-max query scheme in fog-based smart agriculture IoT,
    which can obtain the max/min data of any specific region (including the whole
    region). To protect the security of the proposed scheme, we design data encryption
    and comparison technique based on BGN homomorphic encryption technique. The adoption
    of the BGN homomorphic encryption technique not only strengthens the security
    of the proposed scheme but also enables the proposed scheme to support the incremental
    updates over ciphertexts. Meanwhile, our range-max query scheme is a non-interactive
    scheme, so there are no interactions between the IoT devices and the fog node
    during the query process. 8 Conclusion In this paper, we have focused on the range-max
    query and proposed an efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query in fog-based
    smart agriculture IoT. Specifically, we first build the K2-treap, which is used
    for storing the data collected by agriculture IoT devices and support efficient
    range-max query and dynamic update of the data. Then, we design a data encryption
    and comparison algorithm based on BGN homomorphic encryption technique and present
    an efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query in the fog-based smart agriculture
    IoT, which can not only securely compare two data based on their ciphertexts but
    also support the incremental update directly over ciphertexts. Notably, our comparison
    technique and range-max queries are run by the fog node, so there are no interactions
    between the agricultural IoT devices and the fog node during the comparison and
    query. Finally, we conduct a detailed security analysis and performance evaluation.
    The results show that our proposed scheme can indeed protect the privacy of the
    agricultural IoT devices’ data and query results, and the experimental test results
    prove that our proposed scheme is efficient. In future work, we will continue
    to focus on the privacy protection of smart agricultural IoT applications and
    further explore some general and efficient privacy-preserving range query solutions.

  description: Agriculture plays a most important role in our Indian Economy. As agriculture
    struggles to support the rapidly growing global population, various agricultural
    problems such as plant disease detection/recognition, weed detection, environmental
    prediction, seed quality prediction, seed classification and animal intrusion
    detection are the major threats to crop production and quality of food. Early
    diagnosis and identification of such problems can be helpful for the farmers to
    prevent the loss in crop yield and quantity of crop production. The above mentioned
    agricultural problems which require a monitoring mechanism is one of the recent
    research topics in the agricultural field. The recognition and classification
    of agricultural plant diseases, seed classification, animal/bird intrusion detection,
    pest detection, weed detection by utilizing the deep learning techniques which
    is used to analyze and learn about differential features in a very stratified
    way will minimize risks related to crop protection. IoT based machine learning
    approach for Smart farming is used for environmental impact, agricultural production,
    food security and sustainability. A huge demand for food production must be achieved
    while the population is growing rapidly. Food security will be ensured by sustainable
    farming procedures. Emerging ICT technologies such as IoT, computer vision, cloud
    computing, big data analysis, remote sensing, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence,
    machine learning and deep learning could create new applications to understand
    climatic changes better which would be helpful to increase agricultural productivity
    and food security. IoT gives a new dimension for smart farming and the agricultural
    domain. Thus, IoT based smart farming provides solutions to automate the process
    for irrigation systems, crop monitoring to improve the quality and quantity of
    crops and monitor the agriculture land with the help of IoT sensors. In this chapter,
    IoT based machine learning approach is proposed for rice plant disease detection
    and has achieved an accuracy of about 95% respectively.

    crops 1. Introduction The global population has rapidly increased in the last
    century to over 8 billion people today. The global population is projected to
    be 9.7 billion by 2050, with most of the population growth taking place in Sub-Saharan
    Africa [1]. In conjunction with population growth, dietary changes due to higher
    per capita income and increased use of bioenergy will become major contributors
    to the growth of global agricultural demand [2,3]. There is some debate on the
    future agricultural demand, with predictions of increases between 60% and 110%
    by 2050 [4,5]. Sub-Saharan Africa has historically lagged behind the developed
    world in terms of agricultural advancements. It is generally accepted that agricultural
    intensification and the expansion of agricultural lands could allow the industry
    to meet global demand, but with certain environmental trade-offs [[6], [7], [8]].
    For example, agricultural intensification leads to decreased soil health, loss
    of insect biodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, amongst other
    effects [3,[9], [10], [11], [12]]. In developing countries, agricultural output
    is predominantly increased by expansion but most of the agricultural expansion
    takes place in the tropics, forests and rainforests. According to Ref. [13] approximately
    49–80% of new croplands are replacing forests, with the largest (34%) cropland
    expansion being on the African continent. It is therefore pertinent that new,
    sustainable, and innovative solutions are directed at developing countries, especially
    Africa, in order to increase the agricultural output, while also conserving the
    environment in the light of global climatic change [14,15]. 1.1. Africa: climate
    change and agricultural production Bearing in mind the high levels of inequality
    and poverty on the African continent, it has been reported that climate change
    has contributed to many countries’ challenges because it negatively affects available
    water resources for agricultural activities [16,17]. Many farmers in southern
    Africa are practicing agriculture in rural areas at a small scale and at subsistence
    level, with minimal or no resources or inputs [16,18]. Although small-scale farming
    has been recognised as a path out of poverty, especially in Africa [19], global
    climate variability is changing this perspective and strategies to cope with the
    impact of climate change in the agricultural industry on the continent are necessary
    [18] to enable #Zero hunger by 2030. However, since Africa is one of the most
    food insecure continents, it is anticipated that it will be difficult to totally
    eliminate hunger by 2030 [19]. This is because its agricultural production is
    heavily reliant on rain for irrigation, whereby 95% of the production is rainfed
    [20]. The frequency and intensity in the occurrences of droughts, increasing temperatures,
    and uneven rainfall patterns are all climatic variables that are currently limiting
    agricultural productivity in Africa [21]. These challenges will only increase
    chronic food insecurity due to the ever-increasing demand for food, which is expected
    to double by 2050 [20]. [22] indicated that temperatures on the African continent
    will continue to rise faster than the global average, and it is predicted that
    this will continue as long as greenhouse gas emissions are not controlled [16].
    Although Africa is responsible for less than 4% of all greenhouse gas emissions
    globally, it is by far the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change [[22],
    [23], [24], [25]]. It is predicted that most parts of the African continent will
    experience much drier conditions [17,26,27]. The vulnerability of the agricultural
    industry to climate change has, in the last decade, increased food insecurity
    [17,19,28]. As such, the current evident effects of climate change on the industry
    have motivated an important change in agricultural research [29,30], for instance,
    looking into climate-smart technologies that conserve water and the planet [15,16,[31],
    [32], [33]]. However, the limited capacity and inaccessibility of resources on
    the continent to adapt to the negative effects of climate change and variability
    limit agricultural productivity [34]. In some African countries (i.e., South Africa,
    Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Lesotho, Ethiopia) policies and coping strategies have been
    made available to farmers [35], but adoption largely depends on the farmers’ willingness
    to participate [31,36,37]. Nonetheless, available land for agricultural purposes
    is declining with the rising population, water scarcity, land degradation, and
    increasing soil erosion [16,17]. This challenge points the agricultural industry
    towards climate-smart cultivation practices [[31], [32], [33]]. Soilless agricultural
    technologies cause less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional conventional
    farming practices [38] as these technologies produce crops using less space and
    water, reduce toxic mineral waste runoff, and have the ability to improve the
    ecological footprint [32]. 1.2. 4th Industrial Revolution: climate-smart technologies,
    internet of things, and agriculture The world is currently undergoing a 4th Industrial
    Revolution (4IR), which is characterised by the fusion of physical, digital, and
    biological systems at a pace that has never been seen before [39]. In agriculture,
    climate-smart technologies are viewed as an important level in the maintenance
    of the global food nutrition and security in this new era of climate change [39,40].
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has played a substantial role in enabling this paradigm
    shift by enabling the wireless connection of machinery and sensors with each other
    and with the internet. The introduction of IoT into agriculture is allowing a
    more data-driven approach, simultaneously leading to cost-effective management
    of farms and a reduced environmental impact [40]. This could be a way to fundamentally
    change existing agricultural practices to be more efficient and more sustainable.
    Unfortunately, the cost of current IoT solutions is preventing many small-scale
    farmers, including those in developing countries from using this technology. IoT
    monitoring solutions do exist, but they are scarce and expensive since they are
    meant for large-scale high-tech operations. However, it is the rural small-scale
    farmers that can benefit the most from IoT solutions, since they have the largest
    gap between attained yield and theoretical yield [14,[41], [42], [43], [44]].
    Solutions are being developed for large-scale, high-tech operations like those
    seen in developed countries where the attained yield is approaching the theoretical
    yield. In addition to smart technologies, food production can further be intensified
    with the use of soilless cultivation – one of the fastest growing water-wise agricultural
    technologies globally [45]. 1.3. Soilless cultivation: aeroponics and hypogeal
    crops Soilless cultivation such as hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics have
    proven to have the capacity to solve challenges that limit agricultural productivity
    as they all promote sustainable agriculture [38,45]. Aeroponics is one soilless
    cultivation technique in which plant roots are suspended in the air as there is
    no rooting substrate [46]. [47] reported that aeroponics allows for the total
    control of root zone nutrition, temperature, moisture and gaseous phase. As root
    zone temperature and nutrition can be controlled in aeroponics, it will be impractical
    to control moisture and the gaseous phase in hydroponics [46]. As aeroponics offers
    a non-invasive way to study plant roots it enables the study of the roots’ response
    to drought during plant development, an important feature because it is an expected
    consequence of climate change. Our global food system is currently dominated by
    three crops, maize, wheat and rice, where these crops account for 50% of the worlds
    food production [48]. This poses a significant risk to food supplies throughout
    the world, as climate change-related hazards are currently extreme and increasing
    [49]. The Food and Agriculture Organization is proposing the move towards a direction
    of nutrition-sensitive agriculture using approaches that seek to ensure the production
    of a variety of affordable, nutritious, culturally appropriate food that sustainably
    meets dietary needs [50]. In this study, we designed and developed a low-cost
    IoT-enabled solar-powered aeroponics system as a proof-of-concept for the cultivation
    of a hypogeal legume, Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.), which
    is an underutilised and neglected African crop. The incorporation of orphan and
    underutilised crops into the mainstream agriculture can diversify the global agricultural
    system, as they have shown to be more nutritionally dense and resilient to climate
    change [49,51,52]. The often-neglected Bambara groundnut has been referred to
    as a crop of the future [52]. It is a great source of high-quality protein that
    is protein is rich in the amino acid lysine [53,54]. Being highly nutritious,
    it has the potential of playing a critical role in improving the global economy
    and food security system [55,56]. In developing countries orphan and underutilised
    crops are often cultivated in marginal soils by poor resourced farmers [55], as
    they require little or no input in their production cycle. Nonetheless, there
    is limited literature on the effects of climate change on the cultivation or possible
    production using climate-smart agricultural systems for Bambara groundnut. Therefore,
    the information presented in this study, will be vital, not only in the promotion
    of Bambara groundnut, but also promote the cultivation of alternative crops for
    climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the first account of
    the successful (to maturity) cultivation of a hypogeal legume in aeroponics. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Plant material and study site description Seventy Bambara
    groundnut landraces were used in this study. The seeds were sourced from different
    subsistence farmers in Limpopo Province, South Africa (Location: 23.4013°S, 29.4179°E).
    Seeds were separated according to the IPGRI Bambara groundnut descriptors. For
    the purposes of this first report, we randomly selected 25% (18) of the 70 the
    landraces’ data to present (Fig. 1). The study was performed at an Experimental
    Farm in a tunnel from December 2021 to May 2022. Daily minimum and maximum temperature
    averages ranged from 10 to 34 °C (data was obtained from the sensors in the IoT
    system). Download : Download high-res image (635KB) Download : Download full-size

    aeroponics system design The system consisted of 30 units, with the lid of each
    growing tank designed to accommodate 12 plants (Fig. 2a). Each unit was a black
    160 L tote storage bin with holes on the side to allow 20 mm pipes into the tank,
    with six (50 μm droplet) misting sprinklers attached on the pipe sections that
    were inside the bins (Fig. 2b). A 0.75 kW pump was connected to a 5000 L reservoir
    tank holding the nutrient solution, which contained a modified Hoagland solution
    with a ratio of 1 N:2.4 K [57]. The nutrient solution was prepared from peanut
    (Arachis hypogea) fertiliser recommendation. This was done as they are both hypogeal
    plants and currently there is no fertiliser recommendation for Bambara groundnut
    from government or private agencies. The pH of the nutrient solution was maintained
    at 5.5 to 6.0, and it was measured daily and corrected if necessary, using 1 N
    KOH or 1 N H2SO4. The EC of the solution during the study ranged from 1.2 dS/m
    to 1.3 dS/m. Download : Download high-res image (539KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the holes on lids of the growth bins, and b) indicating how the irrigation
    was set up inside the bins (not drawn to scale and some components are not shown,
    e.g., drainage lines and power source). This nutrient solution was pumped from
    the 5000 L tank through an inlet pipe that allowed the fog misters to spray the
    roots of the plants inside the totes (Fig. 2). The nutrient solution was supplied
    through a misting schedule of 15 s every 20 min from 8 am to 8 pm. Irrigation
    was suspended at night, as the stomata close to avoid the loss of water when plants
    are not photosynthesising. Excess nutrient solution in each of the units drained
    through an outlet at the bottom of each bin, connected to 20 mm drainage pipes,
    which led to a 120 L drainage tank. Once the drained solution had reached a certain
    level in the 120 L drainage tank, a valve opened, and a 0.75 kW pump returned
    the drained nutrient solution to the reservoir tank. Plants were inspected daily
    for pests and diseases, while the nutrient solution was refreshed every two weeks
    to avoid the over accumulation of nutrients, and to prevent bacterial and fungal
    growth in the nutrient reservoir tank. 2.3. Experimental design and procedure

    comparative purposes, landraces were planted in traditional drip irrigation hydroponics
    in sawdust media in 10.5 L bags (Fig. 5). Five seedlings from each landrace (350
    plants) were arranged in a complete randomised block design. Nutrient solution
    was the same for both systems, but the irrigation scheduling in the sawdust was
    2 min, every 4 h from 8 am to 4 pm daily. The irrigation in the sawdust, was suspended

    of Things (IoT) system Temperature control inside the tunnel was achieved with
    an extraction fan on the eastern side and a wet wall on the western side. These
    two were switched synchronously to regulate the temperature inside the tunnel.
    Prior to this trial, these two actuators were operated manually. The IoT solution
    was developed to automate the temperature control by switching of the fan and
    the wet-wall pump. The switching algorithm, which is implemented on a Raspberry
    Pi (a small computer), has three DHT22 sensors that measure both temperature and
    humidity (one of each placed on the eastern extremity, middle of the tunnel, and
    western extremity) for the sensing, and a solid-state relay (SSR) for the switching
    (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (330KB) Download : Download full-size

    (not drawn to scale). The middle temperature reading was used to control the actuation
    switches to concurrently control the fan and the wet wall pump. After trial-and-error
    testing, an upper threshold of 30 °C to turn the fan and the wet-wall on, and
    a lower threshold of 22 °C to turn the fan and the wet-wall off produced the most
    efficient autonomous operation. The upper and lower thresholds produced a “dead
    band” that avoids repeatedly turning the fan and the wet wall on and off in quick
    succession. The Raspberry Pi aggregates all the sensor data every 5 min and sends
    it to a Telegram bot via cellular connection, and records locally in a Comma Separated
    Value (CSV) file. The main purpose of the Telegram bot was to provide near real
    time data of the tunnel''s characteristics to assist in decision making for the
    trial. At the end of each day, the locally saved CSV file was uploaded to Dropbox
    where we could download and analyse the day''s data (see example Fig. 7). Download

    20 days after transplanting, then every two weeks for six weeks: (i) plant height
    (PH) was measured from the base to the highest point of the plant (cm); (ii) number
    of leaves (NL) was counted from fully developed trifoliate leaves; and (iii) Chlorophyll
    content (CC) was measured using an AtLeaf digital chlorophyll meter (AtLeaf CHL
    PLUS, FT Green LLC, DE, United States). The AtLeaf chlorophyll meter is an inexpensive
    instrument with readings strongly correlated to the SPAD chlorophyll meter [59].
    The data was tested for normality and was found to be normally distributed (Table
    1) and was therefore subjected to repeated measures ANOVA. Table 1. Test for normality

    Bambara groundnut landraces were compared using the Lavene and Barlett tests for
    homogeneity, whose assumptions of were violated at p < 0.0001. This was then followed
    by Welch''s F test to determine whether there were any differences between the
    BGN landraces for a given trait within and between treatments (aeroponics and
    sawdust). Least significance difference was accepted at p < 0.05. Analyses were
    conducted in R Studio version 4.1 2 (R Core team, R Foundation for statistical
    computing, Vienn, Austria). 3. Results There were no significant differences in
    plant height between the BGN landraces grown in aeroponics and sawdust (Welch''s
    F = 0,0515; p > 0,821). Plant height ranged from 18 to 35 cm in the aeroponics
    system and 15–38 cm in the sawdust (Fig. 8). In the aeroponics system, BGN 14
    had the lowest plant height at week 2 and gradually increased between weeks 4–12
    (Fig. 8a), while in the sawdust, BGN 6 recorded the lowest plant height (Fig.
    8b). It was observed that BGN 52 recorded the highest plant height across all
    sampling times (week 2–12) in both the aeroponics and sawdust (Fig. 8a and b).

    4. Discussion This study presented the first cultivation of an underutilised and
    hypogeal African legume, the Bambara groundnut, in an aeroponics (Fig. 11a) and
    traditional sawdust drip irrigation hydroponics (Fig. 11b). There are no records
    in literature for either medium relating to the cultivation of this crop. We also
    presented the coupling of an accessible IoT platform that can easily be scaled
    up to control temperature and humidity in tunnel environments. The IoT platform
    was successful in monitoring and controlling the tunnel environmental (temperature
    and humidity) conditions in the tunnel. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    in a) aeroponics and b) sawdust media. Plants were mounded with sawdust. This
    is an agricultural practice that improves pod development in Bambara groundnut,
    as pod development and enlargement is sensitive to long photoperiod. The repeated
    measures ANOVA indicated that plant height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll
    content were landrace dependent. The number of leaves was significantly higher
    in the sawdust-grown landraces than in the aeroponics system. In aeroponics, the
    nutrient solution was supplied in the form of a misting set intervals, which may
    have limited aboveground biomass but improved root growth and development. This
    might have been a response of the landraces in aeroponics to adapt to water deficit
    during the misting intervals. Plant height comparison between aeroponics and sawdust
    showed no statistical significance, possibly indicating that adaptability in different
    growing conditions. Moreover, the chlorophyll content in the landraces grown in
    the aeroponics system much higher than of those grown in sawdust [60]. reported
    that Bambara groundnut landraces with a high chlorophyll would have a much higher
    photosynthetic potential, which normally leads to a greater plant growth rate
    and performance. Sawdust physiochemical properties change over time during plant
    growth, which could have directly influenced the chlorophyll content in the plants
    because the decomposing sawdust may have been competing for nutrients, especially
    nitrogen. Though not tested, observations suggested that Bambara groundnut has
    the ability to tolerate and survive under heat stress. Heat stress is one of the
    abiotic environmental factors that are known to severely affect physiological
    aspects in plants. It is important to note that there was a general reduction
    in chlorophyll content during week 6 in all the landraces (Fig. 10), which may
    have been due to the plants experiencing abnormally high temperatures (averaging
    45 °C–55 °C) in the tunnel as a result of faults with the electrical supply at
    the experimental site. The significant decline in the chlorophyll content in week
    6 can suggest that there was possible structural damage to the chloroplasts of
    the plants. However, this decline in the chlorophyll content could have also been
    a protective response against heat stress [61]. The rate in the possible protective
    response mechanism in the Bambara groundnut landraces could be an important indicator
    to target landraces for heat stress tolerance breeding. 5. Conclusions This study
    has demonstrated that Bambara groundnut cultivation is possible in both aeroponics
    and traditional drip-irrigated hydroponics (sawdust). From this study, it can
    be concluded that aeroponics was beneficial to Bambara groundnut plant height
    and chlorophyll content, but not all landraces performed the same within and between
    systems. The different growth responses of landraces in both systems justifies
    the need to understand the anatomical, physiological and genetic mechanisms of
    individual landraces. In addition, future research should focus on the yield performance
    of the different Bambara groundnut landraces in aeroponics. Climate change adaptation
    and mitigation strategies such as climate smart-agricultural technologies need
    to be extensively explored for farmers in countries where water scarcity and arable
    land for agricultural purposes are depleting. With aeroponics and hydroponics,
    water is usually recirculated, meaning that a fixed volume of water can be used
    during the planting season, in turn addressing water conservation and efficient
    water usage practices. By being able to use IoT in controlling the temperature
    and humidity, this research most likely used water more efficiently. The aeroponics
    and IoT systems are proposed as a solution to provide subsistence farmers in rural
    communities with an alternative and sustainable method of cultivating underutilised
    crops to support themselves and their communities. The system is also suitable
    for individuals and companies who want to shorten the value chain from farm to
    fork. The target environments within which the system may be utilised demands
    certain characteristics, which are as follows. • Low cost: the system is meant
    to support rural communities, who do not have a lot of disposable income. The
    system must be inexpensive to be a feasible replacement for current practices.
    • Durable: the system could operate outside for long periods, exposed to extreme
    weather conditions and replacing components periodically should be cost-effective.
    • Easy to use: many farmers are unfamiliar with aeroponics and might be reluctant
    to adopt it if it is difficult to operate or assemble. Having the system be easy
    to use could increase its attractiveness to farmers looking for alternative solutions.

  description: Smart farming is a well-known and superior method of managing a farm,
    becoming more prevalent in today's contemporary agricultural practices. Crops
    are monitored for their overall health and productivity using various information
    and agricultural technology. This involves monitoring the state of the field crops
    and looking at various other indicators. The ultimate objective of smart farming
    is to decrease the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while maintaining
    the same level of quality in the final result. The Internet of Things has enabled
    smart farming via different data collecting and storage methods. For example,
    intelligent sensor networks gather field data for optimum plant irrigation in
    contemporary irrigation systems. As the dependency of smart farming on the IoT
    environment increases, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The reason
    is that IoT networks include so many nodes with few resources available, making
    securing them a challenging problem. Therefore, the need for an intrusion detection
    system (IDS) that can adapt to such difficulties is of the utmost importance.
    This paper proposes a new system that detects intrusions in IoT networks used
    in agriculture. The NSL KDD data set is used to evaluate the proposed method,
    which starts by performing several pre-processing steps on the original feature
    set. Important features are selected using recursive feature elimination, then
    converted into square color images. Now input images are suitable to be learned
    by different CNN architectures such as VGG16, Inception, and Xception models.
    Performance comparisons of CNN models with classical machine learning algorithms
    are evaluated using accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, and precision metrics.
  doi: 10.1016/j.iot.2023.100709
  explanation: 'The paper titled "An optimized CNN-based intrusion detection system
    for reducing risks in smart farming" by El-Ghamry, Darwish, Hassanien, aims to
    develop an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) for smart farming environments
    using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed approach consists of
    several steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, data balancing,
    and hyperparameter optimization. The evaluation is conducted on the NSL-KDD dataset,
    and the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and
    outperforms existing IDS approaches on the same dataset.


    The paper contributes to the current scientific body of knowledge by proposing
    a novel IDS that leverages deep learning for accurate intrusion detection with
    a reduced feature set. Furthermore, the authors perform hyperparameter tuning
    for deep learning pre-trained models using a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    optimizer, which enhances the evaluation metrics compared to models without hyperparameter
    tuning.


    The study''s relevance to the review''s intention is apparent in its focus on
    enhancing the security of automated systems for real-time irrigation management.
    The integration of IoT and machine learning technologies in smart farming introduces
    new vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, which the proposed IDS is designed to mitigate.'
  extract_1: '"CNNs are gaining popularity due to the developments of deep learning
    advancements. Most of the research present a collection of pre-processed data
    to the applicable classifiers, and most research has focused on developing end-to-end
    models using deep neural networks (DNN) architectures such as Convolution neural
    network (CNN). Using these models can lead to useful outcomes, such as reduced
    complexity in the data and enhanced ability to classify it. However, there are
    two major flaws in the majority of the works that have been reviewed: The first
    is that the class-imbalance problem isn''t being addressed by most recent efforts,
    which instead focus on various deep learning methodologies to address performance
    constraints in this domain. Second, the models that do not apply feature selection
    procedures employ features not discriminated against for final decision-making.
    As a result, only a select few papers have addressed these two pressing issues.
    Additionally, most of the analyzed work use features in numerical format, which

    rights and content Abstract Smart farming is a well-known and superior method
    of managing a farm, becoming more prevalent in today''s contemporary agricultural
    practices. Crops are monitored for their overall health and productivity using
    various information and agricultural technology. This involves monitoring the
    state of the field crops and looking at various other indicators. The ultimate
    objective of smart farming is to decrease the amount of money spent on agricultural
    inputs while maintaining the same level of quality in the final result. The Internet
    of Things has enabled smart farming via different data collecting and storage
    methods. For example, intelligent sensor networks gather field data for optimum
    plant irrigation in contemporary irrigation systems. As the dependency of smart
    farming on the IoT environment increases, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
    The reason is that IoT networks include so many nodes with few resources available,
    making securing them a challenging problem. Therefore, the need for an intrusion
    detection system (IDS) that can adapt to such difficulties is of the utmost importance.
    This paper proposes a new system that detects intrusions in IoT networks used
    in agriculture. The NSL KDD data set is used to evaluate the proposed method,
    which starts by performing several pre-processing steps on the original feature
    set. Important features are selected using recursive feature elimination, then
    converted into square color images. Now input images are suitable to be learned
    by different CNN architectures such as VGG16, Inception, and Xception models.
    Performance comparisons of CNN models with classical machine learning algorithms
    are evaluated using accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, and precision metrics. Previous

    farming 1. Introduction Over the past century, humanity''s population has grown
    exponentially. By 2100 [1], it is predicted to reach a maximum of 10.9 billion.
    In the last fifty years, technical advancements in genetic engineering have greatly
    contributed to an increase in the quality and quantity of the world''s food supplies.
    Plants and seeds improved through genetic engineering can help feed a growing
    population while using less water. The next technological advance in agriculture
    will be \"smart farming\", which will allow for the long-term sustainability of
    food production [2]. Smart farming is a mix of various emerging technologies like
    Blockchain, 5 G communications, artificial intelligence (AI), drones, the Internet
    of Things (IoT), edge/fog computing, cloud computing, software-defined networking
    (SDN), smart grids, etc. [3]. In the rest of the sections, smart farming, agriculture
    4, IoT enabled agriculture are used interchangeably. In smart farming, data must
    be shared between various smart devices, which is why intelligent agriculture
    devices use the wireless network to send information to the Edge/Fog node and
    sink node [3]. This wireless network can take many forms, including the mesh network
    (ZigBee based), the GSM network (4 G/5 G based), the star network (LoRa based),
    and the software-defined networking. Since many IoT devices are deployed in public
    air, the biggest obstacle to establishing smart farming is ensuring users'' security
    and privacy. Several privacy and security concerns are linked to each layer of
    the IoT architecture because smart devices rely mainly on wireless networks to
    communicate [4]. For instance, an adversary might launch a wide variety of cyberattacks,
    such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, to render a service inaccessible
    and then insert fake data, which has consequences for food security and the effectiveness
    of agri-food supply chain and agricultural output. Additionally, systems developed
    for the heating and ventilation of a vertical farm or a drone used for spraying
    crops might be compromised in a cyberattack that targets smart farming. Some recent
    high-profile cyberattacks include those on the water system in Florida [5], a
    beverage company in Australia called ion which deals in dairy and drinks, and
    the wool broker software that is considered the largest meatpacker in the world
    [6]. Protecting advanced IoT networks increasingly requires the use of intrusion
    detection systems. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are crucial for identifying
    malicious actions. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are network security technology
    that monitors and analyze internal system events for signs of intrusion [7]. An
    intrusion detection system can recognize a network or operating system''s protocol
    failure. The IDS may be used in tandem with other security technologies, such
    as encryption methods, authentication, authorization, and Blockchain, to further
    protect smart farming systems against cyber-attacks [8,9]. While developing an
    IDS, many researchers turn to AI-based methods, including deep learning, hierarchical
    strategies, reinforcement learning, and voting-based extreme learning machines.
    Applying deep learning to the issue of network intrusion detection is a newer
    field of study. With the right data and training, deep learning can significantly
    improve large datasets'' representation extraction and result quality. And recently,
    deep learning has seen major advances thanks to the convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) work. Agricultural IoT networks, like any other IoT network, have the same
    security and privacy concerns as any other IoT application. This paper presents
    a methodology to detect attacks on smart farming systems and agricultural IoT
    networks. The NSL KDD data set [10], developed to solve the problem of the KDD''99
    data set, which is mentioned in [11], is utilized as the input data set for this
    methodology. Data from NSL-KDD are pre-processed, all symbolic characteristics
    are converted to numerical ones, and all numerical ones are subsequently transformed
    into symbols. The principal component analysis is used to extract characteristics
    from a dataset. The pre-processed dataset is then fed to machine learning techniques,
    including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest
    (RF), to establish its categorization. Measures of accuracy, Precision, and Recall
    are used to evaluate the efficacy of various machine learning (ML) algorithms.
    Not only are security and privacy crucial for IoT networks related to agriculture,
    but also for all different IoT applications. This paper proposes a system for
    identifying intrusions into agricultural-based Internet of Things networks that
    depends on CNN models in the detection task. A publicly available data set (NSL
    KDD) is utilized for evaluation purposes as input in the proposed approach. The
    data is first processed to obtain accurate results. Following this data-cleaning
    operation, the pre-processed dataset will be sent into the feature selection step.
    A recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique will cut down the total number
    of features and ensure that only discriminative features are passed on to the
    classification phase. At the next stage, the input data are converted from tabular
    format to images using a predetermined number of attributes. Then, image data
    were classified using several CNN models (VGG16, Xception, Inception), and we
    measured how well they performed using performance indicators such as accuracy,
    Precision, F1 Score, and Recall measurements. Finally, the best-performing CNN
    model is chosen for hyperparameters optimization to achieve an optimal fit between
    the dataset and this model. This paper has the following contributions: • Constructed
    an efficient IDS that applies a deep learning approach to provide accurate intrusion
    detection with a reduced feature set. • Propose a hyperparameter tuning for deep
    learning pre-trained models using a PSO optimizer that allows the proposed model
    to improve the evaluation metrics compared with the model without hyperparameter
    tuning. • Evaluated the proposed method using the NSL-KDD dataset and used multiple
    performance indicators, which show that the results of our method outperform existing
    approaches. • Critically evaluate the existing literature on cyber threats on
    the NSL KDD dataset. • Presented details of threats to smart farming and their
    implications. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines
    details of possible attacks on smart farming systems. Section 3 presents existing
    intrusion detection systems applied to the NSL KDD dataset. Section 4 explains
    the proposed methodology to detect intrusions in a smart farming environment.
    Section 5 shows and discusses our approach''s experimental results and compares
    them with state of the art. Section 6 presents the conclusions and future steps
    of our work. 2. Cyber attacks in smart farming systems An agricultural product
    requires a combination of various technologies to execute certain activities.
    For example, an irrigation system contains smart sensors, different actuators,
    several software modules, communication protocols, and human involvement. These
    complicated systems are generally outsourced from multiple suppliers, which increases
    the attack surface. Cybercriminals can exploit weaknesses to hack agricultural
    applications. Some attacks are comparable to those that target IoT networks, while
    others are unique to smart farming. There are different forms of threats in a
    smart farming environment. One form occurs because the Investment in a smart farming
    system is often substantial, and the systems may remain in use for years. Technicians,
    farmers, merchants, service providers, and others utilize them often during their
    careers. Users'' private information may be at risk if they access the system,
    opening the door to identity theft. Commercially sensitive information is another
    risk. Theft of data results in the disclosure of private business information,
    which may compromise both local and international business dealings (farmer to
    a service provider or international trade). There are many ways to categorize
    commercially sensitive data. Production efficiency data are used by competitors
    in trade choices, giving them an edge over primary producers. Furthermore, growth
    data might lead to focused study and IP theft attempts. Competitors may get an
    advantage in negotiations by acquiring access to sensitive information such as
    a farm''s land value, price information, trade volume, selling patterns, and growth
    statistics. These firms become weak links in a network that hackers may exploit.
    Another attack form to smart farming systems is compromising sensors, actuators,
    or robots, which causes their malfunction. Fields may be destroyed, unauthorised
    products transported, crimes committed, or physical assaults made by smashing
    heavy tractors or drones into the target. Hazardous attacks may be launched using
    GPS spoofing, side-channel attacks, and wireless communication flaws. There are
    also risks associated with the data while they are transmitted, which involve
    the devices and protocols used by networks. It is possible to exploit vulnerabilities
    to sniff out and access data, which can lead to various attacks. These attacks
    include denial of service attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and routing attacks.
    On the other hand, there are risks associated with data not actively being used,
    regardless of whether it is stored on the cloud or locally. The theft of IP might
    result from the breach of data. Examples of these breaches include SQL injection
    and flooding attacks [12]. The proliferation of cyberattacks on the components
    of smart farming systems has led to the necessity of developing effective and
    efficient IDSs to face the catastrophic effects of cybercrimes. The procurement
    of software, hardware, and other services from a variety of suppliers introduces
    security concerns, which have to be taken into consideration during the design
    of smart agricultural systems. There is also the possibility of a disruption in
    the supply chain, resulting in malfunctions in product design, engineering, manufacture,
    and distribution of products and services from suppliers to consumers [13]. Table
    1 summarizes different categories for cyber attacks in smart Farming systems and
    the affected security aspect of each category, supported by their related work.

    be implemented using classical machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid Machine
    Learning. This paper tested the proposed method on one of the most cited and popular
    IDS datasets and NSL-KDD. Various classical machine learning algorithms were explored
    and evaluated for anomaly-based IDS on the NSL-KDD dataset, such as Logistic regressions
    (LR), Artificial Neural networks (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT),
    support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). On the other hand, many
    works applied deep learning algorithms such as Convolution neural networks (CNN),
    deep belief networks (DBN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and autoencoders
    (AE) for IDSs in IoT networks. In this section, recent related IDSs that used
    classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning-based approaches have
    been explored and conducted on the NSL-KDD dataset. Wang et al. [25] proposed
    an intrusion detection system that leverages both supervised and unsupervised
    learning capabilities to increase the detection process''s performance. The k-Means
    algorithm is used to enhance the classification ability of the KNN classifier
    by changing the way the nearest neighbors are selected. The developed model achieved
    comparable results in classifying the four attacks in the NSL KDD dataset. Using
    DNN for IDSs in SDNs, Rawat et al. [26] found the best hyperparameters and network
    configurations in the DNN, resulting in an accuracy of 75.9%. A Localized Evolving
    Based Anomaly Detection Scheme that belongs to Semi-Supervised Learning was introduced
    by Wang et al. [27]. Self-evolution was enabled during anomaly detection by combining
    offline and online learning with a semi-supervised training approach in contrasting
    pessimistic likelihood estimation (CPLE). As a result, the unlabeled data is given
    a strict label during self-training, which makes the model less accurate and leads
    to more misclassification. In CPLE-based models, unlabeled data is soft-labeled.
    Semi-supervised training with 500 labeled and 120,000 unlabeled data points was
    used to create the model. When all features in the dataset are utilized, the recommended
    method achieves an accuracy of 80.93% using NSL-KDD, whereas when just six features
    are used, it achieves an accuracy of 77.26%. Applying ML methods to SDN architecture,
    Dey et al. [28] proposed an OpenFlow controller-based flow-based anomaly detection
    solution. The foundation of their study is the NSL-KDD, which consists of 41 individual
    traits. The dataset was pre-processed using various feature selection strategies,
    such as the Chi-square test, Gain Ratio, Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS)
    attribute subset evaluator, Info Gain, and Symmetric Uncertainty to improve classifier
    output. All feature selection methods retrieved 15 features, except for the CFS
    Subset Evaluator, which only extracted 9. We next apply several classifiers on
    the smaller dataset (10-fold cross-validation is used to aggregate findings from
    J48, Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). This study obtained
    an accuracy of 82% when Gain was utilized as a Ratio feature selector, and Random
    Forest was utilized as a classifier. Latah and Toker [29] examined a variety of
    anomaly-based intrusion detection algorithms and rated their performance using
    a variety of metrics. They focused on developing supervised machine learning algorithms
    that use the following classifiers: Naïve Bayes, Decision trees, Random Forest,
    Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest-Neighbor, Neural networks, Bagging Trees, different
    boosting algorithms, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Principal Component Analysis
    was used to de-dimensionalize the data, and the researchers did this by concentrating
    on only six SDN characteristics. The Decision Tree, which has a rate of accuracy
    of 83.24 percent and an f-score of 89.38 percent, produced the most significant
    results. Tang et al. [30] trained a DNN for flow-based anomaly detection in a
    software-defined network (SDN) model for IDSs. They built a DNN with one input
    layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. They used six features that fed
    to input neurons. These SDN features include basic and traffic-based features.
    Model output is a binary classifier. They employed 12–6-3 hidden layers of neurons.
    The model start settings are ten batches and 100 epochs. The experiments were
    75.7% accurate. Latah and Toker [31] developed a classification approach consisting
    of five-layer that employs KNN, Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), and a hierarchical
    model of ELM (H-ELM) for the first, second, and subsequent layers of the classification.
    The technique takes as input a total of six flow attributes. They used the controller''s
    top-level six flow parameters. Using the NSL-KDD dataset, they discovered that
    their multilayer approach improved system accuracy by 84.29%. A major adaptive
    component, or A-PCA, was introduced by Gao et al. [32] for an IDS that is an improved
    version of ELM, which is the Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (I-ELM). The
    critical parts of network traffic are selectively chosen using an adaptive process.
    As a result, the I-ELM achieves the best detection accuracy possible. The A-PCA
    is responsible for automatically extracting features based on the restrictions
    of the parameters, while the I-ELM is in charge of determining whether or not
    an attack was malicious. The NSL-KDD dataset was used to analyze how well this
    approach performed. A detection rate of 96.1% was achieved during this experiment,
    and they had an accuracy of 81.22%. Zheng et al. [33] suggested an enhanced Extreme
    Learning Machine Classification based on Linear Discriminant analysis as an intrusion
    detection system. By adding a function that measures spatial similarity as a weight
    to LDA, they were able to enhance the between-class scatter matrix, obtain the
    optimal transformation matrix for spatially separating high-dimensional data,
    and use it to shorten the feature set used in the classification phase. They used
    ELM with the single hidden layer NN approach to recognize the data after its dimensions
    were reduced. Evaluation results showed that the proposed ILECA improved generalization
    features and achieved a 92.35% accuracy rate. Rani [34] built an intrusion detection
    system using DNN and a technique based on classifier-level class imbalance. After
    the network data have been pre-processed via data conversion, the data are normalized
    using the min-max approach. After the information has been normalized, it is input
    into an artificial neural network, which subsequently alters the cross-entropy
    function to deal with the imbalanced dataset. The class labels are given weights
    during the training process. The accuracy of the system was measured at 85.56%.
    By combining a long-term memory with a short-term memory in a bidirectional LSM,
    Imrana et al. [35] created an IDS (BiDLSTM). On the NSL-KDD dataset, the BiDLSTM
    method was shown to be more effective than the regular LSTM. Compared to baseline
    LSTM''s 87.26% accuracy, it performed at 91.93%. Table 2 reviews the latest research
    works pertinent to the network traffic categorization test on the NSL-KDD dataset.

    of prior research demonstrates that thanks to deep learning developments, CNN-based
    techniques are gaining popularity. Most studies present a collection of pre-processed
    data to the applicable classifiers, and most research has focused on developing
    end-to-end models using deep neural networks (DNN) architectures such as Convolution
    neural network (CNN). Using these models can lead to useful outcomes, such as
    reduced complexity in the data and enhanced ability to classify it. However, there
    are two major flaws in the majority of the works that have been reviewed: The
    first is that the class-imbalance problem isn''t being addressed by most recent
    efforts, which instead focus on various deep learning methodologies to address
    performance constraints in this domain. Second, the models that do not apply feature
    selection procedures employ features not discriminated against for final decision-making.
    As a result, only a select few papers have addressed these two pressing issues.
    Additionally, most of the analyzed work use features in numerical format, which
    is not the best format for using CNN models that work perfectly with image data.
    The proposed method''s first feature is pre-processing, followed by data balancing.
    After that, numerical features are transformed into images for the best use of
    CNN model capabilities. 4. Methodology of intrusion detection in the smart farm
    environment In this section, we introduce our methodology, which aims to enhance
    the performance of systems that detect intrusions in smart farming environments.
    The proposed wireless network IDS can be applied in a smart farm, as shown in
    Fig. 1, where sensors on Framing and watering components collect Wi-Fi frames
    and send them to the proposed IDS for attack detection. The proposed algorithm
    includes seven stages, as shown in Fig. 2. Firstly, data is collected for experimental
    purposes. In this work, we used the NSL-KDD dataset [10]. Secondly, the data is
    pre-processed to achieve a high-performance model. The number of features produced
    after the data cleaning process is 11 features. Thirdly, the pre-processed dataset
    will be the input to the feature selection stage, which includes applying a recursive
    feature elimination algorithm to reduce the number of features and guarantee that
    only discriminative features will be used in the classification stage—applying
    recursive feature elimination algorithm help to cut the feature set to 9 features.
    In the fourth step, tabular data is transformed into images based on the number
    of selected features so that input images can fit the CNN models. In the sixth
    step, the classification process is implemented using different CNN models (VGG16,
    Xception, Inception), and the model was assessed using different performance indicators.
    Finally, the CNN model with the best performance (VGG16) is selected for the hyperparameters
    optimization stage to fit the dataset with this model for superior results. Download

    Pre-processing phase For our study, we are only interested in detecting the intrusion.
    That is, the proposed approach aims to determine whether any intrusion has occurred
    in the network system. So this problem is considered as a binary classification
    problem. The first step in the proposed methodology is data pre-processing which
    consider a crucial stage in most machine learning pipelines. In this step, several
    operations are performed on raw data, such as dealing with missing values and
    dimension reduction for faster processing and better performance. Algorithm 1
    shows the performed pre-processing steps. Algorithm 1. Pre-processing stage. 1.Check
    NULL values present in Train set and Test set 2.Convert categorical features to
    numerical using One-Hot encoding technique 3.Check number of 0 s in the Target
    Column in Train set and Test set 4.Target Encoding normal to 0, all attacks to
    1 in new column \"is_intrusion\" 5.Drop the redundant label columns [''attack'',
    ''intrusion'', ''level''] and use only [''is_intrusion''] 6.Removing features
    where variation is 0 7.Drop redundant and meaningless input features 8.Compute
    the standard correlation between attributes and Target column 9.Select a set of
    features that are highly correlated with the Target column 10.Remove high correlated
    feature by checking collinearity The pre-processing algorithm starts by checking
    the data for null values and then removing the data row containing any missing
    value due to the abundance of data. Since the feature set contains both Numeric
    and Categorical fields. The second step is to convert categorical data into numbers
    using one-hot encoding to be ready for further processing by the machine learning
    algorithms. Thirdly, the label column is encoded into two values: 0 denotes no
    intrusion, and all other attack values as 1, which denotes that there has been
    an intrusion. A new column named “is intrusion” is added, containing the flags
    above for each record. The column intrusion is now set as our target column. In
    the fourth step, the columns with zero variations are removed since they won''t
    contribute to the classification process as they lack meaningfulness and discrimination
    abilities. In the fifth step, a statistical approach is used to study the input
    features'' relationship with the target column. The correlations of the input
    features with the target column are calculated. Columns that have a very high
    (> 0.9) or a very low (near 0) correlation with the target column are removed
    from the feature set such as [ (num_outbound_cmds), (srv_count), (dst_bytes),
    (src_bytes), (land), (is_host_login), (urgent), (num_failed_logins), (num_shells)].
    Then, the top 20 features that are most correlated with the target column ordered
    by their absolute value are selected, as shown in Table 3. The sixth step is to
    check for collinearity between input features and remove or combine highly correlated
    features such as [ (flag)_(S0), (dst)_(host)_(srv)_(serror)_(rate), (dst)_(host)_(serror)_(rate),

    Data balancing stage After cleaning and pre-processing, the resulting dataset
    includes two classes: 0 for the Benign class and 1 for the attack class. The ratio
    of the number of records for each class in the training and testing dataset is
    shown in Fig. 3. The Figure shows that the resulting dataset suffers from an imbalance
    problem since the number of records belonging to the Normal class is larger (67,342)
    compared to that of instances in the attack class (58,630). To address this problem,
    Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique Evaluation (SMOTE) is applied to handle
    the imbalance classes problem. SMOTE is one of the most successful methods used
    in different practical applications. SMOTE generates new records of the minority
    class by interpolation, it uses the average of some instances in the normal class
    for the creation of new samples for that class. After this step, we can ensure
    that the percentage of the normal attack classes is 1 to 1. Download : Download

    in Training and Testing set. 4.3. Feature selection stage Feature selection is
    a crucial stage in detecting malicious network flow more accurately. If the feature
    selector module is ignored from machine learning pipelines, wrong classification
    and long training time would be possible. Deep discussions regarding the cruciality
    of the feature selection process for attack detection are shown in [50]. The authors
    reported that applying feature selection helped to reduce training and testing
    time and increase the performance of models. Recursive feature elimination (RFE)
    is adopted in this work to select the most discriminative feature set. RFE algorithm
    belongs to the wrapper-based attribute selection approach. It works by adopting
    a search mechanism to make the feature set the most minimum while preserving the
    discrimination ability of the features. The RFE technique starts by learning an
    initial feature set, then weights are assigned to the trained features, and finally,
    features whose weights value are minimum are ignored. This process is repeated
    until the algorithm reaches the most discriminating set of attributes. The resulting
    feature set can produce the best performance of the proposed model while consuming
    the least computation time. In each iteration of the RFE algorithm, an ML model
    is applied for record partitioning. Selecting the appropriate model to enhance
    the stability of the selection process. This work applies a random forest classifier
    because the features are related to the target in a non-linear form. Finally,
    RFE partition records of the dataset depending on the column of the class label
    [51]. The RFE algorithm reduces the feature set to 9 input features, shown in
    Table 5. Table 5. Reduced feature set after applying the RFE algorithm. Index

    to generate an appropriate input for the intrusion detector module as the NSL-KDD
    dataset contains tabular data. The proposed methodology uses CNN models for the
    detection process. The network traffic needs to be transformed to images that
    are the most proper input format for CNN architectures [52]. First, data is normalized
    to the pixel range to be ready for data transformation. The data is normalized
    by converting features such that the values should also be normalized into the
    scale of 0–255 because image pixels range from 0 to 255. The data samples are
    chunked depending on the feature sizes of network traffic datasets after data
    normalization. As the used NSL-KDD dataset contains nine essential features, 27
    consecutive records, each with nine features (27×9 = 243 feature values in total)
    is converted into an image with the dimensions 9 × 9 × 3. Thus, each modified
    picture is a three-channel square color image (red, green, and blue). After that,
    the transformed images are labeled depending on the attack patterns in the data
    chunks. This image is called \"Normal\" if all chunk samples are normal. If not,
    the image is marked as a threat to the chunk. The final sets of modified images
    are used as input for CNN models. Fig. 4 depicts the typical samples for each
    of the two groups in the NSL KDD dataset. Download : Download high-res image (211KB)

    each class. 4.5. CNN classification stage After tabular data is converted to images,
    different CNN models are applied to the produced images without any additional
    processing. Fig. 5 shows a general architecture of CNN that can be applied to
    the transformed input images. The typical CNN architecture comprises a series
    of convolution-pooling layers that end with fully connected layers. The convolutional
    layers automatically extract features representing normal and attack network flow
    from the images. The pooling layers help reduce data while preserving important
    features and avoiding the overfitting problem of the CNN models. Finally, fully-connected
    layers connect all features and apply activation functions (sigmoid or softmax)
    to produce either normal or attached output classes. Download : Download high-res

    for intrusion detection after tabular conversion to images. The proposed IDS architecture
    applied CNN models that are based on learning transfer. The selected CNN models
    are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Three different models are selected:
    VGG16, Exception, and Inception model, because of their success in different image
    classification tasks [53]. The VGG16 network contains five blocks of convolutional
    layers and three fully connected layers. The Inception model extracts features
    that combine different contexts to form various feature patterns. The Exception
    model extends the Inception network that changes the conventional convolution
    layers to different convolutions that are depth-wise and separable. 4.6. PSO for
    optimizing CNN hyperparameters CNN models have a set of hyperparameters which
    is crucial to tune to get a high-performance detection model and affect the structure
    of the applied CNN models. There are two categories of hyperparameters. The hyperparameters
    in the first category are adapted while designing the model, such as the number
    of frozen layers, the dropout ratio, and the learning rate. However, the hyperparameters
    in the second category are considered the keys to improving performance while
    decreasing training time, such as the number of epochs, early stop patience, and
    batch size. One of the Common hyperparameter optimization algorithms is Particle
    swarm optimization (PSO) which can be categorized as a population-based and meta-heuristic
    optimization technique. It has fast convergence (time complexity is O(NlogN))
    and enables parallelization because particles operate independently. It is based
    on information sharing and cooperation between particles in a swarm. Additionally,
    PSO is applicable for various types of hyper-parameters, which makes it an appropriate
    choice in the proposed methodology. Fig. 6 shows the steps of applying the PSO
    technique for optimizing the hyperparameters of the VGG16 model. Download : Download
    high-res image (549KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. The flowchart
    of PSO-based hyperparameters optimization of the VGG16 model. In PSO, a particle
    group scans the search space semi-randomly. Each particle in the swarm has three
    attributes: current particle position, current velocity, and best particle position.
    The particles in the PSO algorithm need initialization of the position and velocity,
    which is an important factor for avoiding the local minimum problem. After that,
    the algorithm calculates two attributes for each particle: current particle position
    and performance score, which are used to update the velocity of each particle,
    and results in their moving according to the updated velocity vectors. The PSO
    works in an iterative way where the previously mentioned steps continue until
    a particularly accepted convergence [54]. Finally, the particles get closer to
    the promising regions, then stop when a global optimum is reached. 5. Evaluation
    and discussion This paper uses the”NSL-KDD” dataset to evaluate the proposed model.
    We calculated various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 Score, Precision,
    and Recall which are given below. The evaluation experiments have been run on
    MacBook Pro with 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 cores, 6 MB cache) processing units,
    Radeon Pro 450 2048 MB, and Intel HD Graphics 530 with 1536 MB graphics and has
    16GB DDR3 (2133 MHz) of RAM(Random Access Memory). 5.1. Dataset description The
    experiments in this study are based on (the NSL-KDD) dataset, which consists of
    internet traffic samples encountered by a real Intrusion Detection System. The
    dataset is a refined version of the KDD‘99 Dataset. It is used as benchmark data
    to evaluate various intrusion detection methods on modern-day network systems.
    The dataset contains four subsets: KDDTrain+, KDDTest+, KDDTrain+_20Percent, and
    KDDTest+_20Percent. The first two subsets contain all the train and test sets,
    while the latter contains only 20% of the train and test sets. For this experiment,
    we will use the KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ datasets. The dataset presents 43 columns,
    out of which the ‘attack’ field contains the type of attacks detected in the network.
    The score is a field denoting the difficulty level and a binary class attack that
    classifies if there has been any attack on the traffic input. There are 22 types
    and a normal value for no attack, as shown in Table 6. Each attack type is classified
    into four categories: DOS, Probe, Privilege, and Access. The classifications are
    shown in Table 6. Table 6, we can notice that the Denial of Service attack is
    the most popular post popular with higher frequency. Table 6. Types of network
    attacks. Index Attack Type Number of instances Attack category 0 Normal flow 67,342

    The confusion matrix is used as the classification metric of the applied models.
    The confusion matrix consists of four values: True Positive (TP), False Negative
    (FN), False Positive (FP), and True Negative (TN). They are defined as follows:
    1 True Positive (TP): represent the evaluation result that detects the intrusion
    in the smart farm network if the intrusion exists. The TP value is at the entry
    [0][0] in the confusion matrix. 2 False Negative (FN): represent the evaluation
    result that does not detect the intrusion even if the intrusion does not exist
    in the smart farm network. The FN value is at the entry [1][0] in the confusion
    matrix 3 False Positive (FP) (AKA False Alarm rate): represent the evaluation
    result that detects the intrusion in the smart farm network when the intrusion
    does not exist. The FP value is at the entry [0][1] in the confusion matrix. 4
    True Negative (TN): represent the evaluation result that does not detect the intrusion
    even if there is no intrusion in the smart farm network. The TN value is in the
    confusion matrix''s entry [1][1]. The Performance of the proposed network IDS
    in smart farming architecture can be measured using accuracy (A), Precision (P),
    Recall (R), and F1 Score (F1) as the performance indicators for the proposed classification
    method 1 Accuracy (A). The proportion of the total number of correct predictions.
    The formula of accuracy is calculated by: (1) 2 Recall (R) (AKA Sensitivity and
    True Positive Rate) The ratio of the total number of attack samples that are correctly
    recognized divided by the total number of attack samples. It is an appropriate
    metric to use to reduce false negatives. The formula of Recall is given by: (2)
    1 Precision (P). Calculated by dividing the number of true positives by adding
    the number of true positives and the number of false positives. It is a good indicator
    to use when focusing on limiting false positives. The formula of Precision is
    given by: (3) 2 F1 Score (F1). The harmonic mean of the Recall and Precision.
    It analyzes false positives and false negatives. It gives good results when dealing
    with an imbalanced dataset. The formula for the F1 score is given by: (4) 5.3.
    Discussion, results and analysis The detection capability of the proposed framework
    is first evaluated by applying different base CNN models (VGG16, Xception, Inception)
    with default hyperparameter values. The results of evaluating the three applied
    CNN models on the NSL-KDD dataset are shown in Table 7. As shown in Table 7, the
    VGG16 method shows the best performance by achieving 97.89% accuracy with 3.61%
    and 41.3% accuracy improvement compared to Inception and Xception models. Additionally,
    results obtained by applying VGG16 achieve 97.88% F1-score with 3.67% and 47.38%
    superiority, contrasting with the Inception and Xception models. Fig. 7 shows
    the confusion matrix of each of the applied three CNN models on the converted
    images with default hyperparameters values. Table 7. Evaluation of base CNN models

    optimized VGG16 model was used as the base learner to build the proposed detection
    model. The results of the optimized VGG16 model are shown in Table 10. As shown
    in Table 10, the optimized VGG16 model achieves high accuracy, Precision, and
    Recall of 99.99% and 100% F1-scores after data is transformed. Then PSO algorithm
    is applied. Moreover, the results in the Table indicate that the optimized VGG16
    model has at least 2.1% superiority in both accuracy and F1 score compared to
    the VGG16 model with default parameters. Additionally, Among the two models shown
    in Table 8, the proposed optimized VGG16-PSO method gives the best performance
    by achieving at least 1.73% and 1.74% accuracy and F1-score improvements, respectively,
    compared with optimized VGG16 using the Random Search algorithm. that means the
    optimized VGG16 model with PSO algorithm outperform both the conventional VGG16
    model and the optimized VGG16 model with random search method. Table 10. Evaluation

    work has been made on the test set of the NSL-KDD dataset using accuracy, Precision,
    Recall, and the F1 score in Table 11. The proposed approach has obtained satisfactory
    results, and class imbalance, feature selection, feature transformation, and parameter
    tuning play a crucial role in achieving high performance. Most previous works
    have not addressed the issues of the imbalanced dataset and dealing with the full
    feature set, thereby being unable to get high performance on the specified dataset.
    Most of the earlier results reported accuracy ranging from 80% to 91%, as shown
    in Table 11. Table 11. Accuracy of different models in literature and Proposed

    is essential to the country''s economic health since it is the main food source
    for everyone. It links a wide range of businesses around the country. A country
    with a large agricultural industry is considered economically and socially prosperous.
    In the majority of nations, agriculture is an essential source of employment.
    Smart farming [66] is the latest technological breakthrough for the agricultural
    sector''s sustainable food production. Smart farms become possible only with the
    emergence of the IoT and ML [67]. Numerous advantages emerge from the IoT network,
    such as improved efficiency, cost optimization, optimum energy use, forecasting,
    and public comfort. The variety of data processing technologies and processes
    causes reliability and security concerns, hampering the widespread application
    of the Internet of things in farming. This paper presents a technique for detecting
    intrusions into agricultural IoT networks using image-based features and deep
    learning models. An optimized VGG 16 model has a Precision F1 score, and accuracy
    is better than 99%. In the future, we will consider using different DNN models
    with different architectures to evaluate the proposed method rather than pre-trained
    models. Additionally, we will consider different recent datasets for analyzing
    different feature sets. Declaration of Competing Interest There is NO conflict

  explanation: 'The study presented in this paper explores the cybersecurity risks
    and vulnerabilities associated with IoT-based automated irrigation systems and
    proposes several strategies for mitigating these risks.


    The paper begins by highlighting the increasing use of IoT devices in agriculture,
    particularly in automated irrigation systems. These systems offer numerous benefits,
    including improved water efficiency, reduced labor costs, and increased crop yields.
    However, the use of IoT devices also introduces new cybersecurity risks, including
    unauthorized access to sensitive data, malicious attacks on system components,
    and disruption of irrigation operations.


    The paper then discusses the different types of cybersecurity risks that are most
    relevant to automated irrigation systems. These risks include:


    1. Data breaches: Unauthorized access to data stored on IoT devices or in cloud-based
    platforms can compromise sensitive information, such as irrigation schedules,
    crop yields, and soil conditions. This information could be used to sabotage crops
    or extort money from farmers.


    2. Malicious attacks: IoT devices can be targeted by malicious attacks that can
    damage or disable the devices, disrupt irrigation operations, or steal sensitive
    data. These attacks can be launched remotely or through physical access to the
    devices.


    3. Denial of service (DoS) attacks: DoS attacks can overwhelm IoT devices or cloud-based
    platforms with traffic, preventing them from functioning properly. This can disrupt
    irrigation operations and cause significant financial losses.


    The paper concludes by proposing several strategies for mitigating the cybersecurity
    risks associated with automated irrigation systems. These strategies include:


    1. Implementing strong authentication and access control measures: These measures
    can help to prevent unauthorized access to IoT devices and data.


    2. Encrypting data: Encryption can help to protect sensitive data from being intercepted
    and stolen.


    3. Regularly updating software and firmware: Software and firmware updates can
    patch security vulnerabilities and help to protect IoT devices from attacks.


    4. Monitoring IoT devices and networks: Monitoring can help to detect suspicious
    activity and identify potential threats.


    5. Developing incident response plans: Incident response plans can help to minimize
    the impact of cybersecurity attacks and ensure that irrigation operations can
    be restored quickly.'

    IoT and Machine Learning for Sustainable Development Chapter © 2023 1 Introduction
    The world’s population is expected to increase by one-third until 2050. Majority
    of those additional two billion people will be living in the developing countries.
    It is expected that more people will be living in large population centers and
    big cities. If the current trends continue then the agricultural production will
    have to increase by 60% to meet the demands for food and feed by 2050 (Faurès
    et al. 2013). Therefore, farming industry has become ever more important than
    before. In this scenario, agricultural transformation from conventional to technology
    based, can play a pivotal role to feed growing global population and provide the
    foundation for economic growth and poverty reduction. Challenge is to sustainably
    increase the food production to provide food as well as economic opportunities
    in both rural and urban communities (Ahmad and Farooq 2010). The progress in modern
    agricultural industry transformation can be traced back to decade of 1960s. The
    decadal progress in agriculture sector is provided in Table 1. In mid-1960s, the
    breakthrough in wheat and rice production in Asia brought up the famous Green
    Revolution that symbolized the process of using agricultural science to develop
    modern techniques for the developing world. It started from Mexico with the “quiet”
    wheat revolution and in 1960s and 1970s India, Pakistan and the Philippines received
    world attention for their agricultural progress. Over the past four decades in
    Developing Asia, the irrigated area has more than doubled – to 176 million hectares
    (mha). Fertilizer consumption has increased more than 30-fold and tractor in use
    has increased from 0.2 to 4.6 million that can be considered as a positive. What
    the world would have been like without the technological advances that have occurred,
    had the global grain yields of 1950s still prevailed in twenty-first Century we
    would have needed more than 1.8 billion ha additional land to equal the current
    global harvest (Borlaug 2002). Table 1 Decade wise agricultural technology innovation
    and advancement during the past 60 years Full size table An unprecedented systemic
    transformation is needed at a speed and scale to meet the current and future challenges
    of food security. The future agricultural systems need to be more productive,
    use inputs efficiently, have less variability and greater stability in their outputs.
    Moreover, the changing climate also needs the agricultural systems to be more
    resilient to, risks, shocks and long-term climate variability. The objective of
    reducing inputs and production costs as well as increasing yield and profitability
    can be addressed by changing the farming methods from conventional to conservation.
    However, more productive and more resilient agriculture can be practiced through
    a major shift in the way land, water, soil nutrients and genetic resources are
    managed for enhanced resource use efficiency. This transformation can also improve
    producers’ access to markets and a transformed agricultural system can reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production and increase carbon sinks. The
    real transformation has been experienced by the advent of Information technology
    (I.T). It has brought up a revolution; the world is becoming ever more connected
    through it. The building blocks needed to make I.T based Agriculture a reality,
    has started to come together in the past few years. The estimated sale of I.T
    based agricultural gadgets has been increase manifolds as estimated by BI Intelligence
    (2015) and depicted in Fig. 1. We now have the ability to run complex computations
    at huge scales: a 100 times increase in computing power. The development of cloud
    computing resources and technologies can allow us to run calculations across hundreds
    of machines and turn that back into one simple actionable solution. A shift in
    progress of technology delivered smart devices those are smaller, faster and cheaper.
    While computing and sensor technologies are in use in the developed world for
    the last two decades, their application in agriculture has not been fully utilized.
    Smart digital services have the potential to help agricultural industry meet its
    productivity and sustainability challenges. Overall, technologies can be utilized
    effectively to solve indigenous agricultural problems of the developing nations.
    Fig. 1 Agricultural IoT devices marketed in various countries. (Estimates based
    on BI Intelligence, 2015) Full size image 2 Big Data in Agriculture The world
    is becoming digitized. We now can know more about the land that we farm than ever
    before. The availability of geospatial data archives and real-time data sets from
    satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in combination with weather data,
    digitized soil data, and other real-time data streams coming from in-situ smart
    sensors can give us a better understanding of the interaction between crops, weather
    and soil that we would never had before, in ways that are cheaper and faster (Fig.
    2). All that bulk of data (Big Data) along with computational power is worthless
    unless we can turn it into a simple actionable solution that we can put in the
    hands of the farmer. Fig. 2 Conceptual I.T based agricultural data flow system
    Full size image Over the past years an increasing trend towards data-driven agriculture
    has been identified among farmers. According to an estimate provided by BI Intelligence
    (2016), It is estimated that 0.65 million data points are being generated every
    day from the agricultural farms that will reach up to 0.65 million. It is expected
    that more than 2.3 million data points will be generated by 2030 as many growers
    are pushing big data solutions to obtain qualitative and quantitative data to
    improve decisions regarding agricultural management and to increase their crop
    yields. Data in agriculture can be big in many ways. For example, in case of determining
    spatiotemporal variation of actual crop water use in irrigated areas at regional
    scales, a large number of Landsat scenes will cover the area every 16 days, where
    each Landsat scene occupy a storage space of approximately 1000 MB, and if approximately
    20 images were usable for each year of study and for every scene. It makes a total
    more than 500 images per year (for a typical regional scale study) and more than
    1500 images in a 3-year study. For that case, satellite-imagery (one of the input-information)
    only amounts to more than 15 terabytes, whereas the products generated during
    the course of scientific work (evapotranspiration in this case) are 10 times more
    than the original input data. Similarly, a flight of unmanned aerial vehicle covering
    agriculture area of one village (approx. 60 squares) for multispectral and thermal
    sensing generated 1.25 TB of raw data, that will be multiplied accordingly for
    additional flights during the growing season for pattern recognition, change detection
    and crop yield estimation through image processing and analytics. These projects
    are two examples of the work being carried out in digital and precision/climate-smart
    agriculture that is challenging the state of the art in computation, data storage
    and sharing. The climate-smart agriculture’s reliance on I.T. and digital data
    extends far beyond these examples. Data can also be big because of its lasting
    significance agro-ecological zones, soil survey maps, or the observation of other
    unique events. Also, data can be big because of descriptive challenges that may
    require contextual explanation and metadata. Because digital data can easily be
    shared and replicated and so re-combinable, they present tremendous reuse opportunities,
    accelerating investigations already under way and taking advantage of past investments
    in science. To encourage and enable reuse, data must be well preserved in workable
    formats. In some cases, data loss is economic loss (e.g. experiment have to be
    re-run), or it may also be an opportunity lost forever. Data are assets, and to
    achieve the greatest pay-off from these investments, researchers and institutions
    should document and implement data-management and data-sharing plans that address
    the full life cycle of data. The life cycle management of scientific data presents
    many challenges and opportunities. The challenges are great, but they can be solved
    by focused efforts and collaboration between funders, institutions and scientists.
    To facilitate data reuse, data disciplinary standards should be encouraged that
    will ultimately open the doors for development of disciplinary repositories for
    specific classes of data accessible and manageable through specialized software
    tools. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) genetic sequence database (GenBank),
    the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland database (CropScape), the US
    Geological Survey (USGS) land-cover and water database (GLOVIS) and the US National
    Virtual Observatory (USVO) are good examples of what is possible here. The repository
    of big data help to optimize inputs and increase crop yield thus helping farmers
    to get better agricultural produce. The historic trends of particular crop at
    every field can helpful in better predicting harvesting potentials. The evidence-based
    analysis of this big data can assist agricultural experts to predict and monetize
    crop yields while the farmers can get information regarding their crops and marketing
    places. 3 Data Analytics Management and Forecasting 3.1 Data Analytics The analytics
    of the big data can add value to lives of farmers and sustainability of the farms.
    Farmers cannot make sustainable farming choices based exclusively on large amounts
    of data collected at farm level. In addition to that, they also have limited time
    to digest large amount of data to find trends and/or irregularities. Therefore,
    it is difficult for them to gain actionable insights from all the crop sensors,
    drones and automated tractors. A farm management tool or software with the right
    blend of data and machine learning can help a farmer quickly decide which crops
    (down to the level of the plant) need insecticide, and then apply the chemicals
    spraying in a way that limits environmental impact and increase resource use efficiency.
    Moreover, it can also provide an opportunity to the banks and other monetary institutions
    to better assess the agricultural loans and risks associated with it. For example,
    in Pakistan, a pilot has been successfully tested to analyze the farmer’s ability
    to pay back loans to the banks. The data on land records; crop and soil health
    gathered by the multi spectral cameras on board UAV provided sufficient information
    on farmers’ pay back ability. The analytics of the data helped in improving farmers’
    income and productivity through provision of financial & technical services and
    adoption of good practices. Data analysis will be complex for more challenging
    problems of the agricultural system as well as at the individual farm level. However,
    with more involvement of deep learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture,
    it will gradually become possible to find the exact causes of low productivity
    and making real time decisions to take actions. 3.1.1 Real Time Data Analytics
    An alternative term Operational Intelligence (OI) is also used for Real-Time Data
    Analytics (RDA), a method that tracks the behavior of live systems, integrating
    streaming data with customer needs. RDA is implemented in situations requiring
    insight on a daily, frequent basis and enables farmers to analyze what’s happening
    on the farm and take immediate actions and see the results of their actions. RDA
    complements intelligent decision making by providing insight into new unstructured
    and semi-structured data in real-time. It handles Big Data in ways intelligent
    decision-making cannot. The RDA assisted streaming analytics can help agribusinesses
    make functioning decisions, adapt to the business environment and serve customers
    better when it really matters. RDA refers to a class of analytics that uses real-time
    data processing and data visualization into the processes and events while they
    occur. It is well equipped to address the integral challenges of big data by continuously
    monitoring and running query analysis against a range of high velocity and high
    volume big data sources. It associates and analyzes large volumes of (real time)
    streaming data arriving from diverse sources in order to link related events,
    discover problems, and reveal opportunities intelligently, that need immediate
    attention. 3.1.2 Intelligent Decision Making The intelligent decision making in
    agriculture is based on structured and static data collected from different sources
    to identify long-term trends in historical data of days, weeks, or even months
    long. Data generated by smart sensors collected at farms, on the field or during
    transportation offer a wealth of information about soil, seeds, livestock, crops,
    costs, farm equipment or the use of water and fertilizer. Data analytics in agriculture,
    can help farmers analyze real time data of weather, soil moisture, market trend
    or prices, GPS signals from farm machines and provide insights on how to optimize
    the resources to increase yield. It can further improve farm planning to make
    smarter decisions about the level of resources needed and their distribution strategy
    in order to prevent waste. Daily operations can be made more efficient with improved
    system performance. Additionally, the risk of natural mistakes can be reduced
    as management has a clear picture of what aspects are working successfully and
    those which can be classified as waste. The intelligent decision making has variety
    of uses in agricultural industry in particular as forecasted data, environmental
    impact, competitive advantage and waste reduction. The Agri-business Intelligence
    organizations have deployed many such dedicated analytic platforms including data
    accelerators, data appliances, and cloud based solutions to speed up the performance.
    These technologies may still not deliver true real-time data for informed decision-making,
    but they are enabling the update of data far more frequently and deliver answers
    to queries sooner. Taking everything into consideration, the intelligent decision
    making in smart farming leads to decreased expenditure and increased profits.
    The improved production through precision agriculture along with tailored marketing
    for sales using informed intelligence through smart farming to identify trends
    could lead to an extremely efficient agricultural business. 3.1.3 Tools for Big
    Agricultural Data Analysis As discussed earlier, the real-time data analytics
    depends on advanced technologies. All models used to process big data need to
    be fault-tolerant, scale with data, and have flexibility in the use of resources.
    High performance computing platforms that can provide real-time operation in seconds
    and milliseconds are of critical importance. The events need to be handled as
    they arrive for real-time insights, so high performance should characterize the
    chosen solution. Fresh streaming data can be pooled with archived data to support
    decision-making effectively and accurately. For example, the parallelism of Hadoop
    is excellent in batch processing of collected data but it has high latency. However,
    integration of a streaming data platform for continuous data analytics and streaming
    integration, real-time and interactive processing requirements presents a challenge
    that can be solved with further research in this domain. Data needs to be collected,
    processed, stored, and then finally operated for analytics including machine learning.
    In a typical streaming architecture data is gathered from several smart sensors
    that can be spread across a geographical area in an agricultural system. Then
    a distributed funnel mechanism is needed to put data into a set of available servers.
    Chen and Zhang (2014), reviewed technological solutions for data streams processing
    and open-source real-time processing systems, including Hadoop Online, S4, Storm,
    Flume, Spark streaming, Kafka, Scribe, HStreaming, Impala, and relevant messaging
    technologies. Despite the diversity the real-time systems are very similar. However,
    to come up with an efficient framework for gathering, processing and analyzing
    Big Data in agriculture in a near real-time or even better in a real-time perspective
    further research is required. 3.2 Data Management and Forecasting Every industry
    has their own experiences and challenges when it comes to dealing with big data
    and advanced analytics. Agriculture is no different, but progress is being made.
    An excellent example of using big data analytics to support sustainable farming
    practices is a research conducted by CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture)
    in Colombia with assistance from Colombian government and CGIAR Research Program
    on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. The CIAT research used data
    from FEDEARROZ (National Federation of Rice Growers in Colombia) to learn the
    exact causes of shrunken rice crop yields between 2007 and 2012. By analyzing
    past data and considering climate predictions, they made site-specific recommendations
    for crop variety and exact planting dates that are projected to increase yield
    to numbers that surpassed previous rice harvests. These site-specific interventions
    to reduce inputs and increase yields are referred to the term precision farming
    or interchangeably Precision Agriculture (PA). Real-time assessment of operational
    conditions (e.g. weather or disease alerts) and to carry out agile actions require
    reconfiguration features. These features usually include intelligent assistance
    in implementation, maintenance and use of the technology. For that, a PA grower
    must utilize information gathered from a series of smart devices and systems that
    communicate via the Internet to study and observe crop fields. These smart devices
    may be, temperature and soil moisture sensors, GPS farming apps and modules for
    automated machinery, satellite data, as well as drones used for aerial imaging.
    Where precision agriculture only takes in-field variability into account, the
    smart farming enhances PA by analyzing management tasks not only on location but
    also on data, enhanced by contextual and situational awareness, triggered by real-time
    events (Wolfert et al. 2014). 4 Precision Agriculture Lack of information at right
    time is causing massive losses to the farmers’ income and agricultural sustainability.
    The variability of soil from one field to the other, the variability in weather
    and crops that are planted, means the difference in optimal input for the field
    can vary three to four times from one field to the next, from 1 year to the other.
    So as a farmer, there is no way other than to put together these complex variables
    and come to a solution. Unfortunately, majority of our farmers stick back to the
    practices they know. They fall back to what is familiar or conventional and so
    majority of them barely having enough food to feed their families. Nowadays, farming
    practices are being supported by biotechnology, remote sensing, cloud computing
    and Internet-of-Things (IoT) (Li 2018) or Internet of Everything (IoE) (Dey et
    al. 2015). Internet of Everything refers to the intelligent connection of farmers/people,
    processes, data and things. IoE builds on top of the IoT, enhancing the power
    of the Internet to improve business outcomes. Rapid developments in the IoT and
    Cloud Computing are making smart farming possible. It is helpful in managing farms
    and crops database including farm location and size, cultivated area, inputs,
    time of sowing and harvesting as well as yield. Development of crop information
    management system can help the farmers to make quality and timely decisions. A
    system with a common repository that is able to collect, manage, analyze and disseminate
    the quality decision based on the data streams coming from different sources including,
    satellites, UAVs, in-situ sensors, and ambient weather conditions. Such big repository
    needs to be developed associated with high performance computing powers that can
    handle the flow of big data. Sustainably producing the right quantity and quality
    of food to take on food security challenge can be enabled by technologies. Invent
    of artificial intelligence and I.T have opened new horizons in the field of agriculture.
    Now work is being carried out to make real time agricultural robots and auto steering
    technologies to reduce labor requirements. Advanced precision agriculture technologies
    that deploy machine vision, big data analytics and advanced robotics could allow
    farmers to apply the optimal amount of inputs for each crop and assist with the
    management of livestock and aquaculture, thereby boosting yields and reducing
    water use and greenhouse gas emissions . To produce the highest yield with the
    least impact on the environment and use less water, resources and chemicals, while
    feeding our increasing population is a huge challenge. Now, new innovative technologies
    are taking on that challenge. These modern tools provide farmers with a collection
    of data about the status of the soil, insects, crops, livestock, water, and weather,
    etc. The ability to collect such detailed data has the potential to revolutionize
    agriculture and move farming toward more efficient and sustainable practices.
    The PA concept is well adopted in the various developed countries of the world.
    For example, it started in USA and Europe in early 1980s and early 1990s respectively.
    Figure 3 provides an insight of adoption rate of various technologies in Nebraska,
    USA. The spatial variability of soils was mapped and yield monitors were developed
    to map the spatial yield variability. The researchers further developed precision
    seed drills and variable rate applicators for spot application of seed, fertilizer
    and pesticides. Fig. 3 Precision agriculture technologies adoption in Nebraska,
    USA. (Source: University of Nebraska-Lincoln) Full size image The agricultural
    systems with on-board sensors were developed for automated fertilizer spreading
    and agro-chemical spraying. Use of Unmanned Arial Vehicle for agriculture (AgUAV)
    is also a hot topic of research and these are being used for crop monitoring,
    yield mapping and agrochemical spraying. Japanese are working extensively on sensor
    development, digital and hyper spectral image processing on-board UAVs. Information
    technologies platforms are in use for predictions of optimized local farming practices
    for the farmers. They provide information to the participant farmers on crop and
    soil health, weather conditions, socio-economic characteristics, labor and inputs
    availability and other related variables (Cheema et al. 2018). The flow of information
    is well described by Gebbers and Adamchuk (2010) and summarized in Fig. 4. Fig.
    4 Precision agriculture information flow for a cropping season. (Source: Gebbers
    and Adamchuk (2010)) Full size image Information technology can be used in providing
    a precision agriculture package by developing e-farm production system based on
    Precision Agriculture techniques, Crop and livestock management (RFIDs), precision
    irrigation applications, Crop water and pest/disease management, Wireless moisture
    sensing networks, Wireless communication in UAVs used for vegetation health detection,
    Rainfall monitoring system based on mobile communication data, Cloud services
    for knowledgebase on soils, nutrients, yields by making soil, nutrient and yield
    maps and disseminating through mobile networks and variable rate application based
    on GPS and GIS systems. 5 Communication and Information Sharing The innovations
    in Information Communication Technology (ICT) brought changes in many sectors
    yet agriculture and food systems have been slow to benefit from these innovations.
    There exists a great potential to harness the power of digital and I.T. It can
    promote timely as well as evidence-based decisions to improve the entire agriculture
    sector of the developing nations. Awareness and capacity building, better planning
    and community involvement is needed for agricultural breakthroughs. Since ICT
    particularly the IoT and related big data analytics provide electronic monitoring
    of crops, as well as related environmental, soil, fertilization, and irrigation
    conditions. Such a monitoring data can be used to identify which crop varieties
    will meet the challenge enhanced productivity at the particular farm anywhere
    in world. The plant phenomics (an area of biology concerned with the measurement
    of phenomes—the physical and biochemical traits of organisms—as they change in
    response to genetic mutation and environmental influences) is used to characterize
    the crop varieties. Therefore, association of monitoring and related data analysis
    results with specific crop varieties (i.e., plant genes and phenotypes) will revolutionize
    the way food is produced globally. Majority of the smart farming solutions are
    currently point based and limited to the use of specific IoT devices (e.g., a
    specific soil moisture sensor), with no further support for data analysis or sharing.
    To obtain a meaningful solution by using these IoT devices, a significant effort
    is required to integrate and correlate the data obtained from different IoT devices,
    e.g., data sets acquired from, a fertilizer sprayer (made by one manufacturer),
    soil moisture sensors (made by a different manufacturer). Development of such
    integrated model that permits a) effortless integration and use of any IoT sensor
    or device b) supports the scalable data analytics and c) allows plant biologists
    and farmers/growers to analyze and visualize plant performance data, will take
    us a step closer towards the ultimate goal (Jayaraman et al. 2016). Because use
    of internet and smartphones is enhancing rapidly. The data sharing apps with linkages
    to integrated platforms and models are future of farming and agricultural marketing.
    According to the 2015 report of International Telecommunications Union, 3.2 billion
    people were using the Internet across the globe of which 2 billion were from developing
    countries and similarly 92 of every 100 inhabitants in these countries have mobile
    phone subscriptions (ITU 2015). Therefore, the integration of I.T and agriculture
    can provide an opportunity to the farmers to attain maximum benefits by increasing
    yield, improving production, managing harvest and marketing the produce. However,
    more research is required to make customized solution and platforms to provide
    solutions tailored to specific farming scenarios in developing countries. The
    customized platforms for data sharing, manipulation and decision support are the
    key here. Where farmers can remotely monitor their equipment, crops livestock,
    stats about feeding and produce as well as market trends and information. That
    technology can even assist them to run prediction analysis for the crops, livestock
    and market. One of the biggest names in farming equipment John Deere is using
    integrated platform to connect its self-driving farm vehicles to the internet
    and display data of crop yields (BI 2015). All of these techniques are making
    data driven farming a reality. More and more data sources either in-situ, on-farm,
    low altitude or satellites can provide useful information to improve production,
    minimize inputs and environmental services from agriculture. 6 Conclusion The
    world is on the crossover of a technological revolution in the agriculture industry.
    The future of farming is in collecting and analyzing big data. Advanced analytics
    and precision agriculture will be the key to harness the technology and convert
    knowledge to farming practices in order to maximize efficiency. IoT based technologies
    with the involvement of modern instruments (sensors, computers, UAVs and satellites)
    have the potential to systematically change the traditional system of farming
    towards a low input, high efficiency and sustainable farming. These technologies
    will inevitably prove essential for taking on, what would likely be an insurmountable
    challenge, sustainably increasing our food supplies. The application of information
    technologies in agriculture wills not only help farmers to improve economy but
    also help the country to regulate overall economy and trade. Current wave of mobile
    technology proliferation in rural areas could provide opportunity to the farmers
    to improve agricultural productivity based on decisions made backed by better
    information based on big data analytics. With just a click on a smartphone, farmers
    can remove the guessing from their daily work and make the best choices that benefit
    their business and the sustainability of the land. References Ahmad M, Farooq

  key_findings: IoT-based automated irrigation systems offer numerous benefits but
    also introduce new cybersecurity risks, including data breaches, malicious attacks,
    and denial-of-service attacks. Implementing strong authentication and access control
    measures, encrypting data, regularly updating software and firmware, monitoring
    IoT devices and networks, and developing incident response plans can help to mitigate
    these risks.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: To explore the cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities associated
    with IoT-based automated irrigation systems and propose mitigation strategies.
  relevance_evaluation: 'This paper is highly relevant to the point of discussion
    regarding the unique security risks and vulnerabilities associated with IoT-based
    automated irrigation systems within the broader literature review on the automation
    of irrigation management systems. By meticulously examining and discussing various
    cybersecurity risks such as data breaches, malicious attacks, and denial-of-service

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction IoT
    has had a significant impact on many different industries, revolutionizing our
    daily lives and work practices. IoT devices in the healthcare industry [10] allow
    for real-time tracking of medication adherence, vital signs, and remote patient
    monitoring. As a result, patient care is enhanced, early intervention is made
    easier, and hospital readmissions are decreased. Smart traffic management systems
    [11] that optimize flow, reduce congestion, and improve road safety are an advantage
    of IoT for the transportation sector. Supply chain management is improved by IoT-enabled
    tracking devices, which also ensure effective logistics and reduce loss and theft.
    IoT enables smart factories and predictive maintenance programs in the manufacturing
    industry [12]. Proactive maintenance is made possible by real-time monitoring
    of equipment via connected sensors, which reduces downtime and increases operational
    efficiency. IoT-based smart farming systems [13], [14] are used in agriculture
    to keep an eye on crop health, soil moisture, and environmental conditions. This
    data-driven strategy supports sustainable agricultural methods, improves crop
    output, and optimizes irrigation. Smart cities use IoT [15] to manage resources
    effectively, including waste management, energy use, and public services. Intelligent
    sensors and data analytics increase energy efficiency, urban planning, and the
    quality of life for residents. IoT has a broad impact across industries, spurring
    innovation and enhancing productivity [2]. IoT has the ability to revolutionize
    industries and open up new opportunities as it develops. The influence of IOT
    has increased significantly since 2018 according to GlobalData''s Technology Intelligence
    Centre [1]. Figure 1 illustrates this clearly. Fig. 1. Growth of iot sector Show
    All The importance of agriculture cannot be overstated, particularly in light
    of the growing world population. It is essential for guaranteeing food security,
    fostering economic expansion, creating jobs, and advancing sustainable practices
    for the benefit of current and future generations. The implementation of an IoT-based
    smart farming system provides several benefits: A. Detection of Excessive Salt
    Content The system is designed to identify high salt levels in water, which can
    negatively impact plant growth. This capability ensures that plants receive water
    with an optimal salt concentration, promoting healthy growth and preventing damage.
    B. Monitoring of Soil Moisture, Humidity and Temperature The system continuously
    monitors soil moisture, humidity, and temperature levels. Based on these measurements,
    it automatically activates the irrigation system, ensuring that plants receive
    adequate water at the right time to optimize growth and yield. C. Wildlife Intrusion
    Detection The smart agricultural system incorporates sensors to detect the presence
    of wild animals entering the farm. When an intrusion is detected, the system promptly
    alerts farmers, enabling them to take necessary action to prevent crop damage
    and protect their yield. By combining these functionalities, the smart agricultural
    system enables efficient resource management, enhances plant health, and mitigates
    potential risks to crop production. It leverages IoT technology to provide real-time
    data, automation, and proactive notifications, empowering farmers to make informed
    decisions and optimize their farming operations. SECTION II. Related Works S.
    Senthil et.al, utilized a range of sensors alongside IoT technology to enable
    intelligent irrigation of agricultural land [3]. The system effectively employed
    measurements of soil moisture content, atmospheric humidity, and temperature values
    to optimize the irrigation process. Soil moisture sensors accurately determined
    soil moisture levels, guiding the system in initiating irrigation only when necessary
    to avoid over or under watering. Additionally, sensors monitoring atmospheric
    humidity and temperature provided valuable insights, enabling the system to adjust
    irrigation schedules based on prevailing weather conditions. Real-time data collection
    and processing, facilitated by IoT, allowed for swift decision-making and automation
    of the irrigation process. The system autonomously controlled irrigation valves
    or alerted farmers when action was required. S. Heble and colleagues [4] carry
    out similar type of research. P. Supanirattisai et al. leveraged IoT, LoRaWAN,
    cloud storage, and a customized dashboard to automate agricultural irrigation
    by monitoring humidity and temperature [5]. This innovative solution provided
    real-time data access, analysis, and visualization, empowering farmers with valuable
    insights for effective decision-making in irrigation management. L. Kumar et al.
    successfully employed webcam technology and a dedicated mobile app to remotely
    monitor agricultural fields, deterring unauthorized access [6]. By leveraging
    cloud storage, the collected data became a valuable resource for analyzing and
    enhancing farm security. This innovative approach provided farmers with an efficient
    and effective means of protecting their agricultural assets. Similar system was
    implemented by S. Mishra et.al, [7] A drone [8] was deployed by M. A. Al-Shareeda
    et.al, to collect farm data, specifically soil humidity, from ground sensors strategically
    installed throughout the farm by the farmer. This data was utilized to determine
    the precise areas requiring irrigation. The drone was equipped with a spraying
    mechanism for accurate water delivery to the identified locations, optimizing
    irrigation efficiency and water usage. Furthermore, the drone performed the task
    of dispersing seeds across the farm, ensuring uniform distribution for effective
    planting. By integrating drone technology, a streamlined process was achieved,
    utilizing real-time data for automating irrigation and seeding operations, resulting
    in improved resource management and crop growth. R. Dagar et,al, proposed an IoT
    model [9] which employs air temperature, soil moisture, and humidity sensors.
    These sensors collect data and transmit it via Wi-Fi to a central server. The
    server analyzes the information and initiates actions accordingly. While this
    model outlines a basic architecture, real implementations can be more intricate,
    providing enhanced functionality and decision-making capabilities. SECTION III.
    Proposed Methodology Data from the Soil Moisture sensor and the DHT11 sensor are
    both collected by the ESP32 module. While the DHTll sensor monitors the ambient
    temperature and humidity, the soil moisture sensor measures the amount of moisture
    in the soil. The ESP32 module can decide whether to switch the motor on or off
    automatically using the information collected from these sensors. The specific
    rules and thresholds for motor control are determined based on the observed values
    from the sensors. This is explained using Table I. In Table I, the motor running
    condition is denoted by R and not running condition is denoted by NR Table I:
    Conditions for motor activation In the given system, various environmental parameters
    are measured and used to determine the status of temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture level. Let''s break down the conditions and their corresponding descriptions:
    A. Temperature If the measured temperature is below 32 degrees Celsius, it is
    described as Frigid (F). If the temperature exceeds 42 degrees Celsius, it is
    referred to as Intense (I). If the temperature falls between 32 and 42 degrees
    Celsius, it is considered as pleasant (P). B. Humidity If the measured humidity
    is greater than 75%, it is categorized as greater (GR). If the humidity is between
    40% and 75%, it is considered as average (AVG). If the humidity falls below 40%,
    it is described as lesser (LR). C. Soil Moisture Level If the measured soil moisture
    level exceeds 750, it is labeled as dry (DR). If the soil moisture value is below
    450, it is referred to as wet (WE). If the value lies between 450 and 750, it
    is categorized as Medium (M). These conditions are utilized by an ESP 8266, which
    acts as a microcontroller, to automatically turn on/off a motor based on the combination
    of these parameters. By monitoring the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
    levels, the Arduino can trigger the motor according to predefined rules and thresholds.
    Here a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) sensor is utilized to monitor the salt content
    in the water. If the value exceeds 500 ppm, an alert is sent to the farmer through
    an ESP 8266 module. Based on typical specifications for the SW-420, the threshold
    value for impact detection is around 10m/s2• When the vibration or impact exceeds
    this threshold, this indicates the farmer via ESP 8266 module. All the observed
    values are stored in cloud server for further processing. Fig. 2. Block diagram
    Show All SECTION IV. Result and Discussion The experimental setup for the suggested
    method is depicted in figure 3. This is made up of the ESP 8266 and other system-related
    sensors. Fig. 3. Experimental setup Show All Here, the parameters recorded by
    the sensors on the farm are viewed by the farmers using the blynk application.
    In figure 4, this is displayed. Figure 5 provides a comprehensive depiction of
    water consumption patterns across a three-day timeframe, comparing three distinct
    irrigation methods. Our proposed method showcases a relatively efficient utilization
    of water resources, with a modest pumping duration of 7 hours. By contrast, the
    drip irrigation approach demands a more extensive pumping period of 12 hours,
    while the manual irrigation method entails the most protracted water-pumping duration
    of 20 hours and 10 minutes. These findings underscore the potential benefits of
    our IoT-based system, which achieves commendable water conservation while ensuring
    effective irrigation practices. Fig. 4. Blynk application screen shot Show All
    The graph presented in Figure 6 illustrates the accumulated duration of motor
    usage during a three-day period. In the context of IoT-based Smart Irrigation,
    the motor is utilized for only 9.7% of the overall watering time. This percentage
    is notably lower when compared to the motor usage in drip irrigation, which accounts
    for 16.7% of the total watering time, and manual flood irrigation, where the motor
    is employed for 27.8% of the watering duration. Fig. 5. Comparision of water consumption
    patten Show All Fig. 6. Accumulated duration of motor usage during a three-day
    period Show All SECTION V. Conclusion The system incorporates various sensors
    including a soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, vibration sensors, and a TDS sensor.
    These sensors provide valuable data for irrigation control, animal intrusion detection,
    and water quality assessment. Through the integration of the Blynk application,
    the system enables farmers to conveniently access and monitor their fields from
    anywhere, at any time. By utilizing the inputs from the soil moisture sensor and
    DHT11 sensor, the system intelligently activates the irrigation motor based on
    the field''s moisture levels and environmental conditions. The vibration sensors
    serve as effective indicators, promptly alerting farmers about animal intrusions
    and enabling them to take timely preventive measures. Furthermore, the TDS sensor
    plays a crucial role in identifying water salinity, aiding in the maintenance
    of optimal water quality required for crop growth. The implementation of this
    system offers farmers improved control over irrigation, enhanced detection of
    animal intrusions, and better management of water quality. These advancements
    contribute to efficient farming practices, resource optimization, and ultimately,
    higher agricultural yields. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like

    Epidemiology and dynamics of Bremia lactucae in wild Lactuca serriola populations:
    Implications for sustainable lettuce cultivation. Phytopathology, 98(7), 721-729.'
  data_sources: Field surveys of wild Lactuca serriola populations and greenhouse
    experiments.
  explanation: This study provides new insights into the complexities of interactions
    between domesticated and wild plant pathosystems, with implications for agricultural
    disease control. It highlights the potential for cross-talk between these systems,
    the movement of pathogens between them, and the role of nonhost resistance in
    disease management. These findings emphasize the value of studying wild plant
    pathosystems to better understand and control crop diseases.
  extract_1: From recent field studies in the Czech Republic, it is evident that the
    most common weedy host species of B. lactucae is L. serriola (Lebeda et al. 2008a),
    but the epidemiological impact of B. lactucae on wild Lactuca spp. is not well
    known. Quantitative results in the same region showed that lettuce downy mildew
    on L. serriola was both temporally and spatially rather common and infected approximately
    75 to 80% of the natural host populations. However, the degree of incidence and
    prevalence of symptom expression on infected plants and their populations was
    rather low (Fig. 2). No boom-and-bust cycle was recorded and a long-lasting dynamic
    equilibrium between host and pathogen populations is expected (Lebeda et al. 2008a;
    Mieslerová et al. 2013). Nevertheless, enormous variation and heterogeneity was
    found in the expression of macroscopic symptom response on naturally infected
    leaves of L. serriola (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda et al. 2008a). This probably reflects
    differences in the genetic background of the resistance in individual plants and
    their populations, as well as responses to differences in the local environment
    (Lebeda et al. 2008a).
  extract_2: The occurrence of B. lactucae isolates in both pathosystems with combined
    v-phenotype structures supports the potentiality of gene flow between the pathosystems.
    (Lebeda and Petrželová 2004; Petrželová and Lebeda 2004; Petrželová et al. 2013).
    The short distances between these pathosystems (Lebeda et al. 2008a) also favors
    the possibility of gene flow.
  inline_citation: (Lebeda et al. 2008a)
  key_findings: '1. Bremia lactucae is common in wild Lactuca serriola populations
    in the Czech Republic, but disease incidence and severity are generally low, with
    no boom-and-bust cycles observed.

    2. There is significant variation in the expression of macroscopic symptom response
    on naturally infected L. serriola leaves, reflecting differences in host resistance
    and environmental factors.

    3. Bremia lactucae isolates from wild L. serriola and cultivated lettuce exhibit
    combined v-phenotype structures, suggesting the potential for gene flow between
    the pathosystems.

    4. The close proximity of wild and cultivated lettuce pathosystems favors the
    possibility of gene flow and pathogen spillover, highlighting the importance of
    considering both systems in disease management strategies.'
  limitations: 'Limited scope, as the study focuses on a specific pathosystem (Lactuca
    spp.-Bremia lactucae). Methodological issues, as the study relies on phenotypic
    characterization of pathogens using infectivity patterns and v-phenotypes, which
    may not capture all aspects of pathogenicity and genetic diversity.

    Dated information, as the study was conducted over a decade ago, and more recent
    research may have emerged since then. Incomplete epidemiological data, as the
    study does not provide detailed information on disease incidence, severity, and

- explanation: 'This study describes the development and验证of a closed-loop, sustainable
    process for recovering phosphorus from a low-grade Brazilian phosphate ore. The
    process is based on the selective precipitation of phosphorus as dicalcium phosphate
    dihydrate (DCPD), using chelation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
    to prevent co-precipitation of iron impurities. The simplified process comprises
    three sequential precipitation steps at pH 3, 7.2, and 11.9, followed by an EDTA
    recovery step at pH 1.7. The process was demonstrated to effectively produce three
    value-added solid products: (1) gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) at pH 3, (2) DCPD at pH 7.2,
    and (3) an iron and magnesium-rich precipitate at pH 11.9. The DCPD product obtained
    had a P2O5 content of 43 wt% and a P2O5/RxOy ratio of 23.5, indicating minimal
    impurity content. The closed-loop nature of the process allowed for the efficient
    recycling of water and EDTA, minimizing reagent consumption and wastewater generation.
    The findings of this study provide a novel and environmentally sustainable approach
    for the recovery of phosphorus from low-grade ores, which can contribute to addressing
    the global demand for phosphate fertilizers without imposing negative environmental
    impacts.'
  extract_1: This work demonstrates the potential of a closed-loop, sustainable process
    for recovering phosphorus from a low-grade phosphate ore rich in FeO(OH) and SiO2.
    The process consists of leaching with H2SO4 followed by stabilization with EDTA,
    and selective precipitation with CaO. This process can be operated in a closed
    loop to recycle water and EDTA, allowing for efficient separation of P2O5 from
    co-extracted iron without a solvent extraction step.
  extract_2: The simplified version of the process was effective at efficiently producing
    the target products with fewer processing steps and complexity. As such, the simplified
    process, incorporating separations at pH 3, 7.2, 11.9, and 1.7 was selected as
    the best process configuration and its block flow diagram and mass balance is

    Injection System. Sensors, 16(1), 127. https://doi.org/10.3390/s16010127
  data_sources: Laboratory tests
  explanation: This article presents a prototype of the direct nozzle injection system
    (DNIS) for metering and controlling chemical injection rates within autonomous
    irrigation systems. The DNIS utilizes a rapid-reacting solenoid valve (RRV) and
    a closed-loop PID control strategy to achieve precise injection. The authors conducted
    laboratory tests to assess the performance of the DNIS and PID control method.
  extract_1: In this study, a rapid-reacting solenoid valve (RRV) was utilized for
    injecting chemicals, driven by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal at 100 Hz,
    so with varying pulse width the chemical injection rate could be adjusted.
  extract_2: Meanwhile, a closed-loop control strategy, proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) method, was applied for metering and stabilizing the chemical injection
    rate.
  inline_citation: (Cai et al., 2016)
  key_findings: 'The RRV can inject chemicals with flow rates ranging from 0.1 mL/min
    to more than 30 mL/min.

    The PID controller effectively metered and controlled flow rates, with settling
    times less than 3.17 s and steady-state errors less than 0.021 V.

    The closed-loop control system improved the uniformity and stability of chemical
    injection rates compared to an open-loop control system.'
  limitations: The study does not provide a detailed case study of a fully implemented
    autonomous irrigation system in a research or commercial setting. The results
    are based on laboratory tests and may not fully represent real-world conditions.
  main_objective: To test the injection uniformity of RRVs, present a closed-loop
    control method to meter and stabilize the chemical application rate, and evaluate
    the performance of the control system and the DNIS.
  relevance_evaluation: This article is somewhat relevant to the point about case
    studies of successful implementations of closed-loop, autonomous irrigation systems
    in research and commercial settings, as it presents a prototype of a DNIS with
    a closed-loop PID control strategy. The article demonstrates the effectiveness
    of the proposed system in terms of metering and controlling chemical injection
    rates, which is a critical aspect of autonomous irrigation systems. However, the
    article primarily focuses on the design, testing, and evaluation of the DNIS and
    its control strategy, rather than providing a detailed case study of a fully implemented
    autonomous irrigation system in a research or commercial setting. Therefore, it

  extract_1: '"As a result, the allocated surface water to the irrigation districts
    kept constant within the three operational scenarios (i.e., normal, moderate and
    severe water shortages scenarios) and the water distribution operating system
    automation resulted in 16%, 12%, and 9% operational losses reduction. These conserved
    water volumes play as a new surface water source for the irrigation district."'

    integrates fish farming with plant cultivation, utilizing a closed-loop system
    for water and nutrient management. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility
    and effectiveness of this technology in addressing food access and nutritional
    needs in communities facing food insecurity.
  extract_1: According to Yogev et al [9], aquaponics systems have an increased yield
    when compared to traditional agriculture for comparable sizes of land. Because
    this community-sized aquaponics system maximizes subsystems, including the pump
    and solar panels, while minimizing the need for added work by the staff and volunteers,
    replicating the system in additional locations, including at locations intended
    for housing insecure may be possible.
  extract_2: Lastly, this type of system requires less space for a higher yield of
    produce and does not require soil and can therefore be implemented in urban settings,
    where traditional farming may not be feasible.
  inline_citation: (Albright-Borden et al., 2020)
  key_findings: The aquaponics system successfully produced leafy greens and vegetables
    using a closed-loop system with minimal maintenance requirements. The system showed
    good growth rates and yield compared to traditional farming methods on similar
    plots of land. The partnership with a local soup kitchen and urban farm enabled
    the testing of the technology in a real-world setting and provided opportunities
    for community engagement.

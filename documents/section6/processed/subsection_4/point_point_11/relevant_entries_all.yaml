    \             10.18805/ajdfr.R-2183\nABSTRACT\nIndia became independent in 1947,\
    \ when it was still reeling from the impact of the 1943 Bengal famine and world\
    \ as a whole was\nexperiencing the brunt of world war second. Thus India was born\
    \ hungry in a hungry world. The country leaders were well aware of the\nchallenge\
    \ that India was expected to face in terms of food security and it was Jawaharlal\
    \ Nehru who said everything can wait but not\nagriculture. The first president\
    \ of India Rajendra Prasad after taking the chair, the first thing he did was\
    \ to hoist the flag at the Indian\nCouncil of Agricultural Research, declaring\
    \ “India’s most pressing task would be to conquer the battle of hunger. The Indian\
    \ population\nhas increased tremendously from 376 million in 1950 to 1380 million\
    \ in 2020 and it is agriculture and its allied sectors that sustained\nsuch a\
    \ huge population. India still has a significant proportion of population 14%\
    \ undernourished, 35% children stunted, 20% children\nunderweight, 52% women of\
    \ reproductive age anaemic. India could bring out green revolution, white revolution\
    \ and blue revolution in\norder to provide food security to its people. India\
    \ presently is not food deficient; it has attained self sufficiency in food production\
    \ and\nstands exporters of food. However the irony is that India stands at place\
    \ 102 in global hunger index with score of 30 that is a matter of\nconcern (Global\
    \ Hunger Index-GHI, 2019). The problem is in making this food available to the\
    \ people or access to the food is ensured.\nIndia needs nutritional security rather\
    \ than food security besides transformation in agriculture and allied sectors\
    \ to become free from\nhunger. The task is tough and precipitated by Covid-19\
    \ pandemic, but not impossible. India has much strength but will need research,\n\
    extension, implementation and policy framing to have sustainable, nutrition sensitive,\
    \ climate resilient, integrated and smart agriculture\nto eliminate hunger.\n\
    Key words: Food safety and security, Hunger, Indian agriculture, Malnourishment,\
    \ Nutritional security, Nutrition sensitive agriculture,\n             Smart farming,\
    \ Sustainable agriculture.\nIndia was born hungry\nIndependent India was born\
    \ hungry in hungry world on 15th\nAugust, 1947. On its birth India was still reeling\
    \ from the\nimpact of the 1943 Bengal famine that left 3-4 million people\ndead\
    \ (Maharatna 1996). Globally the scenario was not too\ndifferent, the world was\
    \ yet feeling the jerks of world war\nsecond that resulted into 39 million deaths\
    \ in Europe alone\nand periods of hunger became more common even in\nrelatively\
    \ prosperous Western Europe. A severe hunger crisis\nwas witnessed in Greece,\
    \ Netherlands, Dutch, and  Germany\nduring World War II. Impacts of hunger were\
    \ not restricted to\nthe people living in that era but extended to the individuals\n\
    exposed to hunger crisis in utero. Thus when India became\nfree from the British\
    \ occupation in 1947, the whole world was\nsuffering from one or the other form\
    \ of hunger.\nIn India hunger lay at the roots of much of its public\npolicy in\
    \ its early years and over 70 years later, we are still\na hungry nation. The\
    \ nature may have shifted a bit with no\nmajor famines now but malnourishment\
    \ remains the real\nthreat today too. India is still struggling to feed its people\n\
    adequately, according to the UN, India is a home to quarter\nof the world’s undernourished\
    \ population. Indian leaders and\nthink tanks were aware of the fact that they\
    \ are going to\nface tremendous challenge of hunger in coming days after\nfreedom.\
    \ It was K.A Abbas’s 1946 film Dharti Ke Lal, one of\nthe first Indian social-realist\
    \ films, which spread the message\nof hunger being a big challenge ahead. The\
    \ interim\ngovernment led by Jawaharlal Nehru, which took power in\nSeptember\
    \ 1946, realising the hunger challenge, selected\nDr. Rajendra Prasad “President\
    \ of the Constituent Assembly”\nand the first thing Dr. Prasad did was to raise\
    \ the flag at the\nIndian Council of Agricultural Research, declaring “India’s\
    \ top\nconcern would be to conquer the battle of hunger. Dr. Prasad\nwas made\
    \ in-charge of food and agriculture on January 26,\n1950. Therefore independent\
    \ India from the inception of its\nbirth started working towards the food security\
    \ of its people.\nIndependence to India deprived it of wheat and rice\nbecause\
    \ a large area of Punjab and Bengal got severed\nfrom it. India had to import\
    \ food from as far as Argentina\nimmediately after independence to feed its people\
    \ whose\nstaple food use to be rice and wheat (Fig 1). Prime Minister\nFaculty\

    \ A Review\nJawaharlal Nehru took pains to tell his fellow Indians that\nliving\
    \ on rotis made from a mix of wheat and sweet potatoes\nand reducing consumption\
    \ of food can be observed as he\nobserved himself in lieu of food insufficiency.\
    \ Mahatma\nGandhi fervently advocated the removal of all controls on\nfood, allowing\
    \ a total free market to make food available to\nits people after independence.\
    \ However, the then\nGovernment, imposed the system of ration cards that we\n\
    still follow. This intervention was with good intentions of\nreaching to people\
    \ with food, making food available at a\n‘fair price’ so that access to food gets\
    \ improved and to keep\na check on the speculative tendencies in the market, Public\n\
    Distribution System (PDS) was launched by India. Creation\nof Food Corporation\
    \ of India and Agricultural Prices\nCommission in 1965 consolidated the position\
    \ of PDS. It\nmade government to announce a minimum support price\nfor wheat and\
    \ paddy and procurement of quantities that could\nnot fetch even such minimum\
    \ prices in the market. The\nresultant stocks were to be utilized for maintaining\n\
    distribution through the PDS and a portion of these were\nused to create and maintain\
    \ buffer stocks. However,\nunfortunately bringing in minimum support prices and\n\
    purchases by government corporations resulted in our\ncurrent situation where\
    \ huge amount of grains is languishing\nin government warehouses, while consumers\
    \ still go\nwanting. Similarly the land redistribution to the farmers has\nbeen\
    \ part of India’s state policy from the very beginning\n(Thorner, 1976). Independent\
    \ India’s most revolutionary land\npolicy was perhaps the abolition of the Zamindari\
    \ system.\nSince independence there has been voluntary and state-\ninitiated land\
    \ reforms in several states like West Bengal,\nKerala and J&K with dual objective\
    \ of efficient use of\nland and  ensuring social  justice (Maharatna,  1996; Besley\n\
    and Burgess. 2000; Basu and Annemie, 2008). Since 1947,\nIndia has enacted perhaps\
    \ more land reform legislation than\nany other country in the world, it has not\
    \ succeeded in\nchanging in any essentials the power pattern, the deep\neconomic\
    \ disparities, nor the traditional hierarchical nature\nof intergroup relationships\
    \ which govern the economic life\nof village society. Indian government policy\
    \ was particularly\na big failure over land reform that precipitated the\nfragmentation\
    \ of land holdings which is being identified as\none of the main problems in enhancing\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity through technology interventions.\nStrengths that\
    \ India showcased post independence\nin food security\nAfter independence recognizing\
    \ the food scarcity, citizens\nof India, be it industrialists, housewives, farmers\
    \ or even\nastrologers kept coming up with ideas they were sure\nwould solve India’s\
    \ food problem and they were not\nprobably wrong.\nGreen revolution\nIt was Monkombu\
    \ Sambasivan Swaminathan, famous as\nFather of Green Revolution, who drove Indian\
    \ agriculture\nfrom food deficient to food sufficient country. In 1960 M. S.\n\
    Swaminathan launched the green revolution that increased\nthe food production\
    \ in the country tremendously and the\nintervention was the product of four things,\n\
    i.\nThe gene technology that  transformed and changed\npeople’s understanding\
    \ of wheat and rice yields.\nii. The services that took the technology to the\
    \ field like\nextension services, credit and insurance.\niii. The public policies\
    \ of input-output pricing like the prices\ncommission.\niv. The farmers’ enthusiasm,\
    \ that was very important in\nbringing green revolutuion.\nGreen revolution has\
    \ increased food production from\n50.80 million tons in 1950-51 to 176.40 in 1990-91\
    \ to 282\nmillion tons in 2018-19 an increase of 455%. The\ntremendous increase\
    \ in staple food production was product\nof increased yield per hectare through\
    \ evolving of high\nproducing varieties and increased soil fertility through use\n\
    of fertilizers. Yield got increased three times in wheat (0.85\ntons in 1961 to\
    \ 2.74 tons 2005) and two times in rice (1.54\ntons in 1961 to 3 tons in 2005)\
    \ (FAO http://economics.\ncimmyt.org). However at the same time the population\
    \ of\nIndia recorded tremendous increase from 376 million in 1950\nto 1380 million\
    \ in 2020. This population growth witnessed\nexponential increase during seventies\
    \ and eighties with\ngrowth rate of 2.5 and has decreased to 0.99 in 2020. India\n\
    was net importer of food grains and depended upon\ninternational food aid up to\
    \ mid-1960s and is now exporter\nof food grains to many countries and moved millions\
    \ of\nFig 1: Shortage of food after independence.\n           Asian Journal of\

    \ This increase in food\nproduction may have made India self-sufficient in food\n\
    production but not food and nutritionally secure because of\naccess to food is\
    \ still a major issue in India.\nMany revolutions successively followed the green\n\
    revolution aimed at achieving food and nutritional security\nfor huge population\
    \ and has been achieved to larger extent\nby the technology interventions in agriculture\
    \ and allied\nsectors (Table 1 and Fig 2).\nWhite revolution\nIt was Dr. Verghese\
    \ Kurien who pioneered the Anand model\nof dairy cooperatives and replicated it\
    \ nationwide and\nbrought in White revolution in 1970 and became famous as\nFather\
    \ of White Revolution. White Revolution increased milk\nproduction from 20 million\
    \ tons in 1950-51 to 176 million\ntons in 2018-19 an increase of 780%. He pioneered\
    \ the\nconcept of dairy cooperatives and today in India we have\nover 190 thousand\
    \ dairy cooperative societies with the\nnorthern part of the country highest number\
    \ of cooperative\nsocieties of over 66 thousand (Statista Research\nDepartment, Nov \
    \ 10,  2020).  India  is  world’s  largest  milk\nproducer, it is exporting milk\
    \ products and has earned 1341\nCrores in 2019 (FAO 2020). The milk availability\
    \ in India\nper capita per day is 394 g which is much higher than the\nICMR recommendations\
    \ of 280 g.\nSilver revolution\nYet another revolution started way back in 1970s\
    \ has\nincreased the egg production tremendously post\nindependence. Production\
    \ of eggs was only 10 billion in 1950-\n51 that got increased to 103.3 billion\
    \ in 2018-19 an increase\nof 933%. This revolution was a step forward for making\
    \ good\nprotein available to the population at affordable prices.\nRed revolution\n\
    In 1980s red revolution was brought in and production of\nmeat got increased from\
    \ 1.65 million tons in 1961 to 8.10\nmillion tons in 2019 an increase of 390%.\
    \ India stands third\nlargest exporter of meat in the world today.\nBlue revolution\n\
    In 1985-86 India witnessed another success story that\nincreased aquaculture production\
    \ from 44843 tons in 1960\nto 8.9 million tons in 2018 an unimaginable increase\
    \ of\n20127%. India stands 2nd in the world for aquaculture\nproduction and this\
    \ sector is fast growing sector with growth\nrate of over 9%.\nYellow revolution\n\
    During year 1986-87 yellow revolution made India self-\nsufficient in oil production\
    \ by 1996-97. However, India has\nnot been able to maintain the production as\
    \ per the demand\nFig 2: Output of agriculture produce by product categories.\n\
    \ Volume 40 Issue 4 (December 2021)\n401\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges,\
    \ Chances and Resolutions: A Review\nand is presently observing a large gap between\
    \ demand\nand availability with per capita availability only 11 g/ person/\nday\
    \ as against the recommended 30 g/person /day.\nGolden revolution\nHorticulture\
    \ sector was targeted in 1990 and India had the\nperiod between 1991 to 2003 known\
    \ as the period of Golden\nrevolution. It increased fruit production from 96.50\
    \ million\ntons in 1990-91 to 313.35 million tons in 2019 an increase\nof 224%.\
    \ This made India a world leader in the production of\nbananas, mangoes, coconut\
    \ and spices and provided\nsustainable livelihood and nutrition options. Today\
    \ India has self\nsufficiency in food production and exports various food grains.\n\
    Challenges that India faces to see country hunger\nfree\nHunger index\nDespite\
    \ all these leaps, India is still a home to one quarter\nof world’s hungry. 194\
    \ million people in India go to bed\nhungry which accounts for over 14% of population,\
    \ of which\nwomen constitute 60%. 80% of all hungry live in rural India\nwhich\
    \ ironically stands food producers. India stands at 102\nrank in Global Hunger\
    \ Index (GHI) among 117 countries\nwith a score of 30, that puts the India in\
    \ a group of serious\nhunger nations (Fig 3). 25 million babies are born every\n\
    year of which 18% (4.54 million) are low birth weight and\n0.57 million die every\
    \ year. Of all these deaths, 88.8% die\nbefore first birth day. India has the\
    \ highest burden of neonatal\ndeaths. 45% of under-5 year deaths are due to under-\n\
    nutrition. India’s children are amongst the most malnourished\nin the world, 20%\
    \ are wasted, 37% are stunted, 15% under-\nnourished (Fig 4). 80% women of reproductive\
    \ age are\nanaemic, 75% women and children are Vit. A deficient. 70%\nIndians\
    \ consume less than 50% RDA of micronutrients and\nonly 9% newborn receive adequate\
    \ diet.\nMalnutrition or under-nourishment\nMalnutrition of the children has very\
    \ serious implications on\npopulation as well as national economy (Fig 5). It\
    \ is the\nmalnutrition that causes neonatal deaths, low birth weight\nbabies,\
    \ resulting in poor mental health, poor learning and\ncognitive abilities and\
    \ poor school performance, increased\ndisease susceptibility, low resistance,\
    \ high morbidity and\nmortality (Singh, 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2016) (Fig 6).\
    \ All\nthese factors ultimately lead to poor work capabilities, low\noutput capacity,\
    \ low income, poverty and reduced GDP.\nTherefore, a strong, secure and healthy\
    \ society contributes\nto the national economy as well.\nFig 4: Status of mal-nutrition\
    \ in India.\nFig 3: Global hunger index.\nFig 5: Reasons for high malnutrition\
    \ in India (Source: NFHS 4).\n           Asian Journal of Dairy and Food Research\n\
    402\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances and Resolutions: A Review\n\
    Not only the food deficiency is responsible for\nmalnutrition, more calorie intake\
    \ has lead to various health\nproblems. The rising trend in purchases of snacks,\n\
    hydrogenated edible oils and ‘other processed foods’ have\nbeen some of the key\
    \ drivers of increased consumption of\nunhealthy processed food products. Further,\
    \ it has been\ndriven by the growing Indian policy focus on promoting food\nprocessing,\
    \ as well as liberalization of FDI in food processing\nand retailing, which enhanced\
    \ the availability and\naffordability of processed foods (Thow et al., 2016).\
    \  There\nhas been an increased intake of sugar, oils and highly\nprocessed food\
    \ in Indian diets  with more apparent changes\nidentified in urban India (Gulati\
    \ and Misra, 2014). Studies\nhave shown that the new dietary patterns are contributing\n\
    towards a number of non-communicable diseases like\ndiabetes, hypertension and\
    \ cardiovascular diseases in India,\nwhich account for a major share of total\
    \ deaths in the country\n(Prabhakaran et al., 2018).\nLand holding\nThe very important\
    \ issue with the country in reducing hunger\nis available land and land holdings.\
    \ India has only 2.3% of\nthe world’s land with 17% of world’s human population\
    \ (2nd\nlargest population in the world). In India 91% farmers are\nmarginal and\
    \ small farmers with less than 2 hectare of farm\nland that infact limits the\
    \ technological interventions in\nfarming, a major constraint in increasing crop\
    \ production.\nSoil status\nFurther the soil has fatigued, organic matter status\
    \ has\ndeclined and micronutrients are deficient. The problems of\nsoil acidity,\
    \ salinisation and sodification are very common.\nSoil organic carbon has reduced\
    \ to 0.3-0.4%, which is four times\nless than the ideal of 1.5%. India has highest\
    \ agriculture\nwater withdrawals, 2 times higher than China and 6 times\nhigher\
    \ than USA and it is projected that India will have 20%\nwater depletion by 2022.\
    \ Expansion of deserts, soil erosion,\nwater scarcity and extreme weather phenomena\
    \ as a result\nof climate change are becoming particularly apparent in\ncountries\
    \ that already suffer from hunger and poverty.\nFarmer’s plight\nBesides deteriorating\
    \ soil conditions for optimal food\nproduction, the farmer’s plight too precipitates\
    \ the situation\nof food insecurity. Ironically, 40% of farmers which are\nproducers\
    \ themselves are food insecure. People engaged\nwith agriculture farming are more\
    \ as labourers rather than\ncultivators, in 1960-61, 76% farmers were cultivators\
    \ and\nonly 24% labourers but as of now only 45% are cultivators\nand 55% are\
    \ labourers. Further 46% of India’s total workforce\nis engaged in agriculture\
    \ which in turn contributes only 17%\nto GDP, that in other terms means more input\
    \ and little\noutput, an inefficient system. There is an increasing trend\nin\
    \ urbanization and India is expected to lead the world in\nurbanization which\
    \ means people engaged in agriculture\nwill get reduced and agriculture produce\
    \ will suffer a lot given\nthe low land holding structure of India. It is argued\
    \ that the\nprojected 50 per cent increase in demand for agricultural\nproduction\
    \ from 2013 to 2050 (FAO, 2017) has to be\nachieved despite the ongoing degradation\
    \ of natural\nresources and the serious implications of climate change\non agriculture\
    \ which in itself is a big challenge.\nPeople associated with farming are losing\
    \ interest in it\nbecause there is no proper market link and many a times\nfarmers\
    \ do not get even the production price to their produce.\nLack of storage facilities\
    \ particularly for perishable produce\nfurther aggravates the farmer’s plight\
    \ and farmers\nsometimes lose everything. India’s total storage capacity is\n\
    70.5 million tons as against requirement of 80.5 million tones\nthat too is mostly\
    \ in Utter Pradesh for potatoes. Available\ncold storage capacity is less than\
    \ the half of the required,\nonly 29.7 million tons cold storage capacity as against\
    \ 61.7\nmillion tons. Transportation of food grains is not efficient\n1 \nFig\
    \ 6: Implications of malnutrition.\n Volume 40 Issue 4 (December 2021)\n403\n\
    and more than 30% of grains supplied through the public\ndistribution system is\
    \ lost because of inefficient storage and\ntransportation system in India. Studies\
    \ have shown that\nfarmers have low price realisation and there is huge wastage\n\
    in the supply chain due to fragmentation, poor storages and\ninefficient information\
    \ flow (Negi and Anand, 2016; Pingali\net al., 2019, Gokarn and Kuthambalayan,\
    \ 2017). Studies\nalso show that India has not been able to reach its full export\n\
    potential due to fragmented supply chain and gaps in\nmitigating the demand of\
    \ importing countries (Mukherjee\net al, 2019; Goyal et al., 2017).\nIndian agriculture\
    \ farmers do not have insurance and\ncredit facilities for their produce which\
    \ makes them more\nvulnerable to economic losses. Minimum support price, yet\n\
    talked enough but is not effectively been worked out and\nimplemented.\nLivestock\
    \ sector\nSimilarly in livestock sector, India keeps high proportion of\nlow yielding\
    \ indigenous livestock with no effective policy to\naddress the issue. Artificial\
    \ insemination for improvement\nof local germplasm with improved and exotic germplasm\n\
    has not achieved promising success and India still has only\n40% AI success. Embryo\
    \ transfer technology has yielded\nscores of research papers in peer journals\
    \ but has not been\nimpressively implemented in the field with the result there\n\
    has not been much improvement in the productivity per\nanimal. India has a huge\
    \ potential of exporting livestock\nproducts owing to large livestock population\
    \ but again due\nto lack of standard quality control mechanism, inability to\n\
    adhere to the food safety standards and poor cold chain\nmechanism, India has\
    \ not made success in increasing the\nglobal market for livestock products that\
    \ stands only 2%.\nGender inequity\nWomen form an integral part of the agricultural\
    \ sector and\nin India women make up a majority of the agricultural\nworkforce\
    \ and are often compelled to work to meet their\nfamilies’ basic needs. While\
    \ their contributions are recognized\nas central to the food and nutrition security\
    \ of households\nand communities, their work is not recognized or supported\n\
    adequately by public policy and social institutions. Indian\nwomen manage agricultural\
    \ work on family farms and receive\nno income, are usually overworked and have\
    \ no wage-linked\nbenefits (Rao, 2012). Apart from agricultural work, both\nhousehold\
    \ work and child and elder care responsibilities\nremain assigned to women within\
    \ existing gender divisions\nof labour (Springer et al., 2012), with the additional\
    \ task of\ncaring for their men. Women continue to face inequality across\nkey\
    \ development indicators including health, education and\nnutrition; discriminatory\
    \ laws and high levels of precarity in\nterms of income, employment conditions,\
    \ safety and well-\nbeing. Gender inequity in India is a big challenge in attaining\n\
    zero hunger as women are main players in Indian agriculture\nand their views,\
    \ ideas and suggestions in agricultural farming\nare not being taken to board.\
    \ Violence against women is a\nstructural barrier to the attainment of food and\
    \ nutrition security\nvia a range of pathways; i. withholding food or restricting\
    \ funds\nto purchase food (Usta et al., 2013); ii. controlling when and\nhow they\
    \ eat (Lentz, 2018), iii. pushing women into high-\nrisk behaviour to secure money\
    \ for food (Rao, 2019) or iv.\nnormalization of physical violence related to the\
    \ non-\nperformance of food-related work (food production, shopping,\ncooking\
    \ etc.) (Bellows et al., 2015; Chilton et al., 2013).\nAgriculture system in India\
    \ is not designed to promote\nhealth. There is more focus on increasing productivity\
    \ and\nnot the nutritive quality that is why India may be food secure\nbut not\
    \ nutritionally secure. Little priority for health sector in\nIndia has put it\
    \ at the bottom of the GHI list. A meagre 1.4%\nof GDP is spend on healthcare\
    \ in India that otherwise stands\n17% in America, 8% in Britain and 3% in China\
    \ with world’s\nlargest population. India is far behind the world average\nfor\
    \ physicians (0.6 V/S 1.3/ 1000) and hospital beds (0.9\nV/S 3/1000). Indians\
    \ are the sixth biggest out-of-pocket\nhealth spenders in the low-middle income\
    \ group of 50\nnations (Vipul  2017; Swagata, 2017). Compounded by high\nout-of-pocket\
    \ expenditures, health-care expenditures\nexacerbate poverty, with about 39 million\
    \ additional people\nfalling into poverty every year as a result of such\nexpenditures\
    \ (Balarajan et al. 2011).\nThe governments mostly do not align their policies\
    \ to\nthe needs of the poorest population. There is lack of\nstrategies to promote\
    \ agriculture in the country in such a way\nthat no-one goes hungry. Corruption\
    \ is one of the greatest\nobstacles to development, land grabbing is a big problem.\n\
    Chances, the India has to become hunger free\ncountry\nWe have discussed in length\
    \ about the challenges India\ndoes confront in achieving zero hunger in the country.\
    \ At\nthe same time India has to identify the opportunities that\ncan be explored\
    \ and availed to see India food and\nnutritionally secure. Some of the opportunities\
    \ that can be\nexplored and researched for ameliorating the hunger in India\n\
    include:\na. Genetic diversity\nIndia has 12% plant, 17% animal and 10% fish genetic\n\
    sources of the world. This treasure with the India can be\nexploited to have the\
    \ best competent, efficient, high\nproducing and resilient varieties of crops\
    \ and livestock to\nmake India hunger free nation. Nutrition-sensitive and\nclimate-smart\
    \ agriculture interventions can tap local potential\nto promote agricultural productivity\
    \ that meets nutritional\nrequirements.\nb. Climatic diversity\nIndia has all\
    \ the 15 climates of the world and 46 soil types\nthat can be exploited to have\
    \ food production in all the\nclimatic and soil niches with nutritionally diverse\
    \ foods. India\nis looking for designated areas with a specific type of food\n\
    production depending upon the soil and climate conditions\nof that area. India\
    \ has, long days and sunshine hours that\nis suitable for the cultivation round\
    \ the year.\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances and Resolutions: A Review\n\
    \           Asian Journal of Dairy and Food Research\n404\nc. Irrigation potential\n\
    India has roughly half of the cultivable area rainfed without\nany proper mechanism\
    \ of irrigation. India has scores of large\nrivers and water bodies that can be\
    \ exploited and managed\nto irrigate the land for food production. This will also\
    \ improve\nthe utilization efficiency. Thus there exists great scope in\nincreasing\
    \ irrigated area, gross sown area and hence\nassured food production.\nd. Work\
    \ force\nIndia has low age dependency ratio 49.2% that means India\nhas a good\
    \ proportion of population in a workable age. This\nopportunity with the India\
    \ is a great asset to face challenges.\nToday, India is one of the youngest countries\
    \ in the world\nwith more than 62% of the population in the working age\ngroup\
    \ (15-59 years) and more than 54% of the total\npopulation below 25 years of age\
    \ (Times of India, 2020).\ne. Livestock resources\nIndia is a cattle wealthy nation.\
    \ Highest livestock population\nwith great diversity makes India a potential country\
    \ for animal\nproducts exportation. India has a long coastline that confers\n\
    it a potential to strengthen the national economy through\nblue revolution. Milk,\
    \ meat, fish and their products have a\npromising demand in many countries. India\
    \ has to build up\nthe export policies and quality control mechanism to invite\n\
    exports of various food products.\nf. Welfare measures\n Although the national\
    \ government has not strengthened the\nagricultural sector through better prices,\
    \ assured\nprocurement or investments in climate-proofing, several\nstate governments\
    \ in India have sought to ameliorate rural\ndistress and other related effects\
    \ of agrarian stagnation\nthrough welfare measures. Leaders in this respect are\
    \ the\nstates of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 55 and 48\nwelfare schemes,\
    \ respectively.\ng. Sanitation and health services\nReaching the goal of nutrition\
    \ security is equally dependent\non state provisioning of clean drinking water,\
    \ sanitation and\nreliable health services. Sanitation, in the Clean India\nCampaign\
    \ (Swachh Bharat Abhiyan), is interpreted as\nuniversal access to toilets. Although\
    \ this is undoubtedly\nimportant, inadequate attention has been paid to the disposal\n\
    of solid and liquid wastes that contributes to the growing\nburden of infectious\
    \ diseases (India State-level Disease\nBurden Initiative Collaborators, 2019).\
    \ Similarly, whereas\nuniversal health insurance (Ayushman Bharat) may support\n\
    curative care, primary health care provisioning remains weak,\nwhich is key to\
    \ disease prevention. The responsibility of health\nand nutrition security has\
    \ been placed with low-paid and\npoorly trained women community health and nutrition\
    \ workers,\nwith little power in their local, rural contexts (WHO, 2019).\nThere\
    \ remains great opportunity with Government of India to\nadequately support and\
    \ empower these workers to perform\ntheir roles, both through skill-building and\
    \ strengthening of\nreferral and back-up health services.\nResolutions to have\
    \ hunger free India\nNutrition sensitive agriculture\nNutrition-sensitive agriculture\
    \ is an approach that seeks to\nensure the production of a variety of affordable,\
    \ nutritious,\nculturally appropriate and safe foods in adequate quantity\nand\
    \ quality to meet the dietary requirements of populations\nin a sustainable manner.\
    \ Now when India is self sufficient in\nfood production, the priority should be\
    \ nutritionally rich and\ndiverse foods. It is high time to use technologies like\n\
    Biofortification, fortification, food diversification, soil\nenrichment, crop\
    \ diversification that can lead to nutritional\nsecurity. We need to have our\
    \ food baskets with varieties of\nfood items that can ensure nutritional demands\
    \ of a person.\nThere is need to include non-grain items viz fruits,\nvegetables,\
    \ beans and animal products to the food basket.\nIndia is not adequately prepared\
    \ to meet the requirements\nof dietary diversity, without enhanced trade. Diversification\n\
    on a large scale (implementation at regional or national level)\ncan help enhance\
    \ availability of diverse foods in markets\nand reduce prices of nutritious foods.\
    \ Integrated farming\nsystems (legume-based cropping systems including crop\n\
    rotation and intercropping, rice-wheat farming systems) favour\nboth diversification\
    \ and sustainable intensification of\nproduction. Home gardening with emphasis\
    \ on nutrient-dense\nvarieties of vegetables and fruit trees and small-scale\n\
    integrated farming systems (mixed crop-livestock-aquaculture\nsystems) have potential\
    \ to improve diet quality and raise levels\nof nutrition for producing households.\
    \ In addition to protein\nand energy, animal source foods are excellent source\
    \ of\nselected micronutrients like iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A,\nvitamin B-12\
    \ and various essential amino-acids.\nUse of neglected and underutilized species\
    \ (NUS)\nFrom a food system perspective, dietary and production\ndiversity need\
    \ to improve to address malnutrition. NUS are\nunder-explored that offer tremendous\
    \ opportunities for\nfighting poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Director General\n\
    FAO highlighted, the crucial role of NUS in the fight against\nhunger and are\
    \ a key resource for agriculture and rural\ndevelopment (FAO, 2012a). Historically,\
    \ underutilized plants\nhave been used for food and other uses on a large scale\n\
    and, in some countries, are still common, especially among\nsmall or marginal\
    \ farmers in rural areas where many are\ntraded locally and a lucky few NUS are\
    \ nutritious, climate\nresilient, economically viable and adapt to local conditions,\n\
    especially in marginal areas. NUS have made their way to\nexport niche markets\
    \ around the world (Akinnifesi et al.,\n2008). NUS have high nutritional value\
    \ and can be an\nessential source of micronutrients, protein, energy and fibre,\n\
    which contribute to food and nutrition security.\nSustainable intensification\n\
    There is no problem in the genetic potential of crops or\nproduction inputs, instead,\
    \ the problem lies in the\ndegradation of natural resources and their yield-related\n\
    functions. Therefore, closing the yield gap, a different\nconcept of sustainable\
    \ intensification, has been coined by\nFAO (www.fao.org/ag/save-and-grow). Sustainable\n\
    Saga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances and Resolutions: A Review\n Volume\
    \ 40 Issue 4 (December 2021)\n405\nintensification means achieving the highest\
    \ possible\nproduction, applying all necessary technologies, while\nkeeping the\
    \ environmental impact below the threshold of\nnatural recovery (United Nations,\
    \ 2015). Conservation\nagriculture is based on key principles including minimum\n\
    tillage, retaining a permanent soil cover and crop\ndiversification (Suraj and\
    \ Behera 2014). Precision agriculture\nis an emerging example that utilizes data\
    \ on spatial and\ntemporal variations in the agroecosystem to make accurate\n\
    agronomic decisions without wasting resources and time.\nEncouraging local production\
    \ of diversified foods to be\navailable locally can be a way out to eliminate\
    \ hunger from\nthe country. Up-gradation of local germplasm, identification\n\
    and propagation of indigenous nutritious plant and animal\nspecies that are more\
    \ resilient and adapted to local\nconditions can make India free from hunger.\
    \ Selection and\nproduction of species and varieties should be based not\nonly\
    \ on yields but also on nutrient content (concept of nutrient\nproductivity),\
    \ thereby enhancing the nutrient supply of\nagricultural products, especially\
    \ for micronutrients.\nCommunity-level initiatives for supporting the saving and\n\
    exchange of seeds (community seed banks, village seed\nfairs, smallholder seed\
    \ enterprises) and protecting\necosystems \n(community-based \nnatural \nresource\n\
    management, reforestation, promotion of micronutrient-rich\nforest foods) should\
    \ be practised to enhance availability of\nand access to genetic resources, Strengthening\
    \ local food\nsystems and empowering local people in local production of\nnutritious,\
    \ adapted and diversified cultivars. Locally available\nfoods must find place\
    \ in the food basket of its locals and its\ndistribution to immediate areas to\
    \ reduce wastage and cost.\nAccessibility to food\nGlobal food security is today\
    \ more of an issue of access to\nfood than its availability. Average dietary energy\
    \ supply\nadequacy (ADESA) shows that minimum nutritional\nrequirement per capita,\
    \ is above sufficient levels globally\n(FAOSTAT) and yet, more than 800 million\
    \ people across\nthe globe are undernourished and malnutrition. This implies\n\
    grossly uneven distribution of food resources and\nemphasizes the urgent need\
    \ for correcting distortions in food\nmarkets. It is a major issue that can be\
    \ addressed by\nproviding effective, efficient and economical public\ndistribution\
    \ system, transportation system, cooperative\nsystem and marketing system. Development\
    \ of quality\ninfrastructure for food storage, cold stores, cold chain\nfacilities\
    \ and logistic services are of prime importance to\nensure accessibility of population\
    \ to food. Accessibility to\nfood is linked to many aspects and a holistic approach\
    \ is\nneeded to ensure accessibility of population to food. It\nincludes increasing\
    \ purchasing capacity, reducing poverty,\nminimising food wastage, abolishing\
    \ fragmented marketing\nwith commission agents and middlemen mafia. One of the\n\
    key issues leading to food losses and wastage is that the\nproduction and consumption\
    \ hubs are located in different\nregions across the entire country for example\
    \ for three key\ncommodities - potato, onion and tomato, which are core to\nIndian\
    \ diet, the production and consumption hubs are far away,\ntherefore, there is\
    \ a need for efficient logistics and supply chain\nnetworks, both in terms of\
    \ physical infrastructure and\ntechnology to manage and match the demand and supply\n\
    to ensure accessibility of people to the food.\nEffective and precision irrigation\
    \ system\n50% of the land is irrigated and 50% remains rainfed in the\ncountry\
    \ that leaves a good scope for increasing the food\nproduction through increasing\
    \ irrigation. India does have\ngreat rivers with rich source as Himalayas that\
    \ can be\nharvested for irrigation of farmlands. India needs to build\ninfrastructure\
    \ for its channelling to different areas across\nthe States. Most parts of the\
    \ India receive monsoon rains\nthat can be harvested, stored and then distributed\
    \ across\nthe States to irrigate farmlands in the country. There has\nbeen little\
    \ rather no change in arable land which was 155\nmillion hectares in 1961 and\
    \ 156 million hectares in 2016 but\nof course decrease in per capita holding from\
    \ 0.34 hectares\nin 1961 to 0.12 hectares in 2016. Similarly India needs to\n\
    develop crop varieties that have less water withdrawals.\nSustainable food value\
    \ chains\nAn effective food system transformation will necessitate firm\ncommitments\
    \ at the international and national levels to\npromote the required policies and\
    \ investments at national\nand local levels. In practical terms, this would need\
    \ to include\nfour main dimensions: (i) underpinning healthier populations\nby\
    \ enabling access to nutritious and healthy food for all; (ii)\nguaranteeing sustainable\
    \ food production, processing, trade\nand retailing; (iii) mitigating and adapting\
    \ to climate change;\n(iv) improving smallholder farmer livelihoods and resilience\n\
    by enhancing prosperity in farming and rural communities.\nFAO has developed guiding\
    \ principles on sustainable food\nvalue chains which can be used as a framework\
    \ for\nupgrading value chains (FAO 2014b).\nMinimising wastages\nWastages do happen\
    \ from food production to consumer’s\nplate and this loss if reduced can alone\
    \ make India free\nfrom hunger. Use of efficient strategies at the farm level,\n\
    efficient transportation system from farm to stores and\nconsumers and ultimately\
    \ proper utilization by the\nconsumers without wasting much can do wonders in\n\
    eliminating hunger from the country. In India food losses\noccur mainly at early\
    \ stages of the food value chain.\nStrengthening the supply chain through the\
    \ direct support\nof farmers and investments in cold chain infrastructure,\ntransportation\
    \ and safe packaging could help to reduce the\namount of food loss. Post-harvest\
    \ handling, processing and\nstorage contributes to a secure food supply and thus\
    \ of\nnutrients throughout the year. It also reserves the quality of\nharvested\
    \ raw material as it moves along the food supply\nchain from the producer to the\
    \ market; reduces losses and\nmakes fresh produce available in local markets as\
    \ well as\nin distant locations.\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances\
    \ and Resolutions: A Review\n           Asian Journal of Dairy and Food Research\n\
    406\nFood processing and value addition of food products\nOut of the total agricultural\
    \ output, the share of food processing\nsector in India was only 46.87 per cent\
    \ in 2017-18.\nComparatively, the share for other developing countries such\n\
    as Brazil (70 per cent), Malaysia (80 per cent) and Philippines\n(78 per cent)\
    \ is much higher (Reserve Bank of India, RBI-\n2020). One of the effective methods\
    \ to preserve the surplus\nfood particularly perishable items and make it available\
    \ to\nthe consumers in the country or outside the country is to process\nthe food.\
    \ Value addition is one of the effective strategies to\npreserve the foods, to\
    \ utilize the non-conventional foods and\nto fetch more. The strategy can be effectively\
    \ utilized to make\nuse of agriculture by-products, which is only 25%.\nResearch\
    \ and innovations\nResearch and innovations will always remain effective tools\n\
    in any system to face the challenges. The nations which\nare using innovative\
    \ techniques are economically and\ntechnologically ahead. In India we have our\
    \ own demands\nin agriculture farming system. Our landholdings are very\nlittle\
    \ and thus need to have farm machinery and technologies\nthat favour our small\
    \ farm lands be it in seed sowing, land\ntilling, crop planting, thrashing, chopping,\
    \ harvesting etc.\nThere is need for more investment on applied post-harvest\n\
    management research/technologies, policy change to focus\non infrastructure development\
    \ including cold storage,\nrefrigerated transportation and efficient distribution\
    \ systems\netc. Research and data collection, data analysis is most\nimportant\
    \ in contemporary scientifically advanced world to\nkeep pace with the increased\
    \ demands. Weather predictions,\ndisease prevalence, disease forecasting and application\
    \ of\nartificial intelligence in agriculture production and\nmanagement is dependent\
    \ on data collection and analysis.\nAwareness among consumers\nAwareness is must\
    \ in present scenario of globalization.\nConsumer is presented with varieties\
    \ of food items claiming\nlot many nutritional benefits with high pricing for\
    \ the product.\nThere is need to aware the consumer through target\ncampaigning.\
    \ There is need to educate the consumers about\nthe requirement of different varieties\
    \ in the food basket\naccording to the physiological status, age, sex and physical\n\
    activities of the consumers. Pregnant ladies, lactating\nmothers, neonates, juveniles,\
    \ athletes, women and men have\ndifferent food requirements and they must be made\
    \ aware\nof their nutritional needs and food varieties that can fulfil their\n\
    nutritional requirements so that a healthy society is ensured.\nStrict implementation\
    \ of product standard specifications\nand food safety standards\nIndia has a huge\
    \ potential of export of agricultural and livestock\nproducts but has not achieved\
    \ much progress in it simply\nbecause of lack of standard product specification\
    \ and\ncertification. Quality control is a major issue with the products\nthat\
    \ have an export market. Therefore India has to ensure\nquality control of agricultural\
    \ products through establishment\nof high end analytical laboratories, sanitation\
    \ procedures,\nSPS, traceability and observance of standard safety\nmeasures that\
    \ can boost the export of food items from India\nin the global market and make\
    \ its economy flourishing.\nRegional trade cooperation and liberalization in\n\
    agriculture products\nIndia is the biggest partner in SAARC, however, the regional\n\
    trade cooperation between the countries is very meagre may\nbe because of undue\
    \ regulatory restrictions, procedural and\ninfrastructural barriers to trade or\
    \ due to certain political reasons.\nIndia needs to strengthen the trade agreements\
    \ with\nneighbouring countries to make diversified food available\nto the population\
    \ at reasonable and affordable rates. Thus India\nneeds strong liberalized trade\
    \ policies, political will and firm\nresolve. India has to increase intra-regional\
    \ agriculture trade\n(Nagesh and Joseph, 2020).\nREFERENCES\nAkinnifesi, F.K.,\

    for an integrated storm water management and irrigation problem is presented.
    The primary objective is to simultaneously ensure that the green space is irrigated
    appropriately and the level of the storm water pond is maintained adequately.
    It is proposed to use closed-loop irrigation scheduling to achieve the objective.
    A steady-state model is developed to calculate the soil water storage for different
    irrigation amounts. To handle the uncertainty, real-time feedback from the pond
    is used to re-evaluate the scheduling optimization problem every week. Simulation
    results show that the proposed closed-loop scheduling gives much improved control

    system 1. Introduction Increased urbanization and reduced natural vegetation have
    led to significantly increased storm water volumes. Storm water is surface runoff
    that flows over roofs, driveways and roads rather than infiltrating into the ground
    during any rain or snow melt events (City of Guelph, 2017). Stormwater is typically
    collected using city drainage system and is either stored in storm water ponds
    or discharged to downstream water bodies. In the literature, there are studies
    on improving storm water quality (Chen et al., 2002, Nnadi et al., 2015, Urbonas,
    1999, Urbonas and Stahre, 1993) and reducing storm water volumes by using permeable
    pavements or construction materials (Pratt, 1990, Rahman et al., 2015). The reuse
    of storm water in irrigating city green space such as parks, sports fields and
    green roofs is advocated for sustainability and has been considered in Herrera
    et al., 2017, Petrucci et al., 2012, Sample and Heaney, 2006, Schwecke et al.,
    2007 and VanWoert et al. (2005). When storm water is used for irrigating neighboring
    parks or sports fields, the storm water is managed near to its source which reduces
    the chance of flooding in downstream areas. To increase the efficiency of the
    storm water pond, overflow and dry-out events need to be reduced. Thus, there
    is a need to study the interplay between storm water pond level and irrigation
    scheduling. In practice, scheduling for irrigation in agriculture involves estimating
    soil moisture consumption based on available weather data and evapo-transpiration
    model and accordingly determining irrigation amount for fulfilling the water deficit
    (Bras and Cordova, 1981, Cahoon et al., 1990, Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2015, Jensen
    et al., 1970, Thorp et al., 2017, Wardlaw and Barnes, 1999). The study by Nguyen,
    Ascough, Maier, Dandy, and Andales (2017) considers irrigation and fertilizer
    scheduling together in a single optimization problem. The uncertainty in evapotranspiration
    (ET) was considered in some early irrigation scheduling studies (Jensen and Wright,
    1978, Rhenals and Bras, 1981). In those studies, it was concluded that explicitly
    considering the uncertainty in ET does not significantly improve the overall irrigation
    performance. On the other hand, it was shown in Gowing and Ejieji (2001) that
    it is worthwhile to explicitly consider the uncertainty in weather conditions
    in irrigation scheduling. The impact of time horizon in irrigation scheduling
    was also studied in Bergez and Garcia (2010) and Cai, Hejazi, and Wang (2010).
    One common feature of the above studies is that they only solve the scheduling
    optimization problem once at the beginning of the crop growing season and use
    the solution for the entire season. Real-time feedback from the field is not used.
    While the above methods were successful, the direct application of them to the
    problem considered in this work, in which there is strong coupling between the
    water pond level and the irrigation of the green space and uncertainty plays a
    significant role, does not work as will be illustrated later. In this work, it
    is proposed to use a receding horizon scheduling approach to handle the uncertainty
    in weather, modeling and to handle the strong interaction between the pond level
    and green space irrigation. In the proposed approach, the scheduling problem considers
    a finite prediction horizon into the future and the solution of the scheduling
    problem is updated every week based on updated weather forecast and real-time
    pond level. The main contributions of this paper include: 1. A receding horizon
    irrigation scheduling approach with re-evaluation (rescheduling) based on real-time
    measurements for improved performance under uncertainty. 2. An approach to develop
    a steady-state model that provides improved estimation of soil moisture in the
    root zone. 3. Extensive simulations comparing the proposed approach with existing
    irrigation scheduling approaches demonstrating the applicability of the proposed
    approach. Download : Download high-res image (336KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. An illustration of the system considered. 2. System description
    and modeling Fig. 1 shows the integrated storm water pond and city green space
    system considered in this work. In this system, storm water from the neighboring
    community is collected by the storm water pond, which acts as a settling tank
    for the contaminants. It is considered using the less contaminated water at the
    top of the pond for irrigating the nearby green space. This helps reduce tap water
    consumption in irrigation and adds flexibility to storm water management. The
    primary objective is to simultaneously ensure that the green space is irrigated
    appropriately and the level of the storm water pond is maintained adequately.
    2.1. Dynamic soil moisture model In this work, the dynamics of soil moisture of
    the green space is modeled as an agro-hydrological system described by the Richards
    equation (Richards, 1931) as below: (1) where is the soil moisture content (cm/cm),
    is the hydraulic conductivity (cm/h), is the vertical distance inside soil matrix
    (cm), includes the source and sink terms , such as soil water extraction rate
    by plant roots and is the matric potential (cm) also known as soil suction. The
    relation of hydraulic conductivity with soil moisture content (Mualem, 1976) is
    shown in Eq. (2): (2) where is saturated hydraulic conductivity, is the shape
    parameter (Schaap & Van Genuchten, 2006) and is the relative saturation given
    by: where is the residual moisture content (cm/cm), is the saturated moisture
    content (cm/cm). Richards equation is often written in the following form: (3)
    where is the hydraulic capacity, which accounts for the change of soil moisture
    due to the change of soil matric potential; that is, . The relation between matric
    potential and soil moisture content is described by the Van Genuchten model (Genuchten,
    1980) as shown in Eq. (4) below: (4) where and are empirical shape factors, and
    is the inverse of air entry suction ( ). In general, is considered as a dependent
    variable of such as . The evapo-transpiration (ET) is calculated using Penman-Monteith
    equation using hourly weather data. The details of the dynamic model are described
    in Nahar, Liu, and Shah (2017). 2.2. Pond level model The dynamics of the pond
    level is modeled based on mass balance where the inputs to the pond include the
    storm water from city drainage system and pond precipitation volume , and the
    outputs include irrigation and evaporation from the pond. It is assumed that the
    pond cross-sectional area is the same at all depths. The equation that describes
    the dynamics of the pond level is as follows: (5) where, (cm) denotes the pond
    level, is the cross-sectional area of the pond and is the area of the green space
    that needs to be irrigated. The evaporation from the pond is calculated following
    the methods described in Kohli and Frenken (2015). The storm water flow rate from
    city drainage system is modeled as a function of the precipitation rate and it
    is assumed that at any time precipitation on the neighborhood of the drainage,
    which has an area of , enters the storm water collecting drainage system. Therefore
    . Also, the precipitation on the pond . Remark 1 In this work, the pond is modeled
    as a tank with the same cross-sectional area from the top to the bottom for brevity.
    In the proposed closed-loop scheduling framework, different types of pond models
    can be used in a straightforward manner as long as the model can represent the
    dynamics of the pond level adequately. When a different pond model is used, we
    should update (13c) in the scheduling optimization problem (13) and the scheduling
    implementation algorithm remains the same. Remark 2 Note that in this work, we
    do not consider water run-off or run-on events due to slopes explicitly. However,
    we assume that water run-on or run-off affects the level of the storm water pond
    through city drainage system (i.e.,  in Eq. (6)). It is assumed that at any time
    50% precipitation on the neighborhood enters the pond through the storm water
    collecting drainage system. 2.3. Modeling of weather conditions To model the weather
    conditions, two different weather datasets were generated. One weather dataset
    represents the historical weather data and the other weather dataset contains
    the actual weather data. To simulate realistic weather forecast an algorithm is
    developed which generates weather forecast either between or near to historical
    and actual weather data. The historical weather data contains weather data for
    32 weeks for six weather parameters including maximum and minimum temperatures,
    humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and the amount of precipitation on hourly
    basis. Since only precipitation has a direct impact on irrigation decision making
    therefore among the weather parameters only precipitation values are reported
    in the study. In the actual weather dataset, the precipitation amount may vary
    considerably from the historical weather data. In the proposed scheduling approach,
    the historical weather data and two weeks’ weather forecast are used. The following
    algorithm is used to generate the weather forecast, where the actual and the historical
    precipitation values are denoted by and , respectively, and their percentage deviation
    is denoted by . a. Check whether the difference between the actual and the historical
    weather data is smaller than . If so, the actual weather data is used as the forecast
    data. b. If is greater than , check if . If true, then the forecasted precipitation
    , otherwise , where . Here for both conditions, we have considered . d. If is
    between and , check if . If true, then forecasted precipitation , otherwise .
    Here, we have considered when is true, otherwise is taken as 0.3. For example,
    if the historical and actual precipitation values of a week is given by mm and
    mm, respectively, then the deviation is . Further, is smaller than , so the forecast
    is given by . Note that in the above algorithm, is a tuning parameter. When is
    small (close to 0), the generated weather forecast will be close to the actual
    weather; when is big (close to 1), the generated forecast will be close to the
    historical data. In this work, we use to make the forecast closer to the actual
    weather condition and at the same time to introduce some uncertainty in the forecast.
    3. Semi-empirical steady-state model for scheduling The models described in Section
    2 will be used to simulate the green space and the pond. The dynamic soil moisture
    model described in Section 2.2 is not suitable for scheduling with large time
    horizon due to its high computational complexity. In this section, a semi-empirical
    steady-state model will be developed for scheduling. Note that since we perform
    scheduling for the crop growing season (e.g. a few months) and use weekly sampling
    time to determine the weekly pond level and irrigation amount set-points, a steady-state
    model is adequate enough to describe the overall trend of the soil moisture over
    such a relatively long period as demonstrated later in the simulation results.
    In many studies, soil water deficit model is used for scheduling. However, it
    only gives soil moisture estimates between field capacity and permanent wilting
    point, which only covers water deficit case and does not consider the stress caused
    to crops when over irrigation happens. Fig. 2 shows the relation between root
    water extraction and soil moisture condition (Feddes, 1982), where the water stress
    co-efficient is shown with respect to soil moisture . The desired stress factor
    is one, which refers to maximum or maximum root water extraction. It can be seen
    that when soil moisture is between and the desired value is achieved. When the
    soil moisture drops to wilting values , the value becomes zero and the plant wilts.
    The upper value of desired soil moisture generally refers to field capacity and
    the lower value depends on both soil and crop types. refers to the aeration point
    above which the plant undergoes severe stress due to lack of enough aeration and
    ceases. In soil moisture deficit model (Allen, Pereira, Raes, & Smith, 1998),
    it is assumed that is equal to the field capacity and water above field capacity
    drains sufficiently fast and over-irrigation never happens. However, in the problem
    considered in this work, water conservation is not the primary objective and the
    green space may need to be controlled close to the saturation but below aeration
    point, to avoid pond overflows. Therefore, a model that is suitable for scheduling
    for the problem considered in this work needs to be developed. The modeling objective
    is to determine a steady-state input–output relation between the influx and soil
    moisture . Download : Download high-res image (93KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Graph of the water stress factor . The steady-state model is developed
    based on the analytical solution to Richards equation in Tracy (2011). To derive
    the steady-state model, instead of Van Genuchten’s model (Eq. (4)), the simplified
    Gardner’s model as shown in Eqs. (6)–(7) is used to estimate the relative hydraulic
    conductivity and soil moisture content. (6) (7) where and is some empirical parameter
    depending on soil properties. With the above simplified model, a steady-state
    relation between the input flux and output pressure head at a specific depth can
    be obtained as follows: (8) where (cm) is the steady-state output pressure head,
    is soil parameter, represents the unknown top steady-state pressure head in the
    analytical solution, is the length of soil profile under consideration, is the
    depth at which the steady-state output pressure head is calculated. The detailed
    steps of this derivation are described in Appendix of this paper. Since the output
    of the steady-state model is , so from Eq. (8) is used to estimate using Van Genuchten’s
    model (Eq. (9)) with the additional term which reflects the role of the term in
    Eq. (8). (9) Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. The steady-state model between input flux and output soil moisture
    . Left figure is for depth 1 cm and right figure is for depth 22.5 cm. The intermediate
    depths are not shown but they also have similar results. Since is unknown in the
    analytical solution, it is proposed to identify based on the data obtained from
    the system. The dynamic agro-hydrological model described in Section 2.1 is used
    to generate soil moisture data for 20 different values of the input flux . In
    each case, the input flux is kept constant for hrs. It is assumed that within
    hours the soil moisture will reach steady-state and the soil moisture value at
    200th hour is recorded. Based on this simulated data, a steady-state relation
    between the input flux and the steady-state soil moisture is generated. It can
    be observed from Fig. 3, that the relation between the flux and soil moisture
    is similar to exponential growth curve. To capture this relation, is chosen as
    an exponential function of . It is considered in Eq. (9) where the numerical values
    were determined using curve fitting. The figure shows that Eq. (9) performs considerably
    well, so this approach is used to determine the output steady-state soil moisture
    values. Since Gardner’s model simplifies relative saturation to be equal to (Eq.
    (7)) instead of the complex term used in Van Genuchten’s model, the use of Gardner’s
    model to determine from results poor performance and therefore is not used. Based
    on Eqs. (8) and (9) as well as the expression of , the steady-state input–output
    model at depth can be expressed as a compact function as follows: (10) In the
    proposed scheduling algorithm, the water storage of the entire root zone will
    be considered. To address this, the entire soil profile under consideration is
    divided into compartments as shown in Fig. 4. In each compartment, the soil moisture
    is assumed to be a constant over the week and will be estimated using the above
    steady-state model. The compartment where the root ends is denoted by , where
    . The water storage within the entire root zone may be approximated as follows:
    (11) where (cm) is the soil water storage, and are the height and soil moisture
    of compartment , respectively. Based on Eqs. (11) and (10), the relation between
    the irrigation inputs and the soil water storage can be expressed as follows:

    by the proposed scheduler and the lower-level set-point tracking controllers.
    The scheduler determines the (reference) amount of water used from the pond for
    irrigation and the (reference) amount of tap water used for irrigation. These
    reference amounts are sent to lower-level controllers for implementation. 4. Proposed
    scheduling algorithm In the proposed approach, the scheduling problem is formulated
    as an optimization problem, which is re-evaluated every sampling time (a week)
    based on pond level feedback to accommodate uncertainty in modeling and weather
    conditions. The scheduler determines the (reference) amount of water used from
    the pond for irrigation and the (reference) amount of tap water used for irrigation
    based on the steady-state soil moisture model and the pond model as well as available
    weather information. These reference amounts are sent to lower-level controllers
    for implementation. The overall hierarchy of the decision making process is shown
    in Fig. 5. 4.1. Formulation of the scheduling optimization Scheduling for irrigation
    using storm water involves solving multiple prioritized objectives using one single
    objective function. For irrigation scheduling the most prioritized objective is
    to maintain soil water storage of the root zone within a desired range. Some secondary
    objectives are to minimize the overflow from the pond for wet seasons and to avoid
    pond drying out and to minimize the use of tap water for irrigation when there
    is no water available in the pond for irrigation. The formulation of the scheduling
    optimization problem at the sampling time is shown below: (13a) (13b) (13c) (13d)
    (13e) (13f) (13g) Eq. (13a) describes the objective function that needs to be
    minimized over the horizon to determine the optimal solution. The decision variables
    of this optimization are tap water usage , pond water usage , slack variables
    and for maintaining soil moisture within range, and slack variable for avoiding
    overflow. In the objective function the tap water usage is directly minimized
    with the cost . The irrigation amount with pond water is also penalized with a
    small cost to make the solution unique inside the feasible range. Eq. (13b) is
    the steady-state model that predicts soil water storage as described in Section
    3. Eq. (13c) is the discrete-time version of the pond level model as described
    in Section 2.2. Eqs. (13d)–(13g) are the constraints of this optimization problem.
    Eq. (13d) is used to keep soil water storage above some lower limit . The variable
    is added to ensure a feasible solution is achieved. Since the violation of this
    constraint is not acceptable so the variable is associated with the highest cost
    in the objective function. Similarly, Eq. (13e) ensures that stays below some
    upper limit and is also associated with large cost . Eq. (13f) describes that
    the pond must not overflow and the slack variable is associated with the cost
    . Eq. (13g) implies all physical constraints. The irrigation amount, pond level,
    and the slack variables are all non-negative real numbers. In addition, the maximum
    value for the pond level is equal to the pond height . In the design of (13),
    soft constraints are used to incorporate constraints on soil moisture and overflow
    to ensure that (13) is always feasible. This approach ensures that a solution
    exists for the optimization problem. 4.2. Scheduling implementation algorithm
    To deal with these types of uncertainty, the scheduling optimization problem is
    re-evaluated every week based on new pond level measurement and new weather forecast
    to form a closed-loop scheduling scheme. At each sampling time, • Step 1: A new
    measurement of the pond level and the weather forecast for the following two weeks
    are obtained. • Step 2: Based on the new measurement and new weather forecast,
    the optimization problem (14) is evaluated to generate the future trajectories
    of and for . • Step 3: Only the first step values and are sent to the irrigation
    control system for implementation for the current week. • Step 4: At the next
    sampling time , go to Step 1 ( ). 4.3. Lower-level controllers As shown in Fig.
    5, the scheduler calculates the reference and and sends them to the lower-level
    controllers for tracking. In this work, it is assumed that ideal lower-level controllers
    are in place and can track the reference values immediately and perfectly for
    the simplicity of presentation. In practice, controllers may be used to track
    these references. Remark 3 Note that before implementing the proposed approach,
    a preliminary study of the field and the pond should be conducted to collect data
    for model parameter identification and uncertainty characterization purposes.
    Once adequate models of the pond and the field are identified, extensive simulations
    based on the models may be carried out for tuning of the weights, sampling time,
    prediction horizon in the proposed design. 5. Simulations In this section, simulations
    are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed closed-loop scheduling
    approach. In the simulations, the models described in Sections 2.1 Dynamic soil
    moisture model, 2.2 Pond level model are used to simulate the dynamics of the
    pond level and the soil moisture of the green space. Specifically, the parameters
    used in the simulations are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Parameters of the experimental

    scheduling First, the performance of the proposed closed-loop scheduling and an
    open-loop scheduling method under two weather conditions over a time period of
    16 weeks is compared. In the open-loop scheduling method, the scheduling optimization
    is solved in the first week only (no re-evaluation) and the solution obtained
    in week 1 is used for the entire 16 weeks. In the first case, a wet weather condition
    is considered. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the historical weather data has precipitation
    during week 1–6 with an average of mm, week 13–14 with an average of mm and finally
    week 23–28 with an average of mm in Fig. 6(a). The actual weather data is shown
    for the first weeks only. It is considered that the actual rain takes place between
    weeks 5–10 with an average of mm. The weather forecast is available real time
    for two coming weeks. Download : Download high-res image (663KB) Download : Download

    from the pond, (c) the pond level and (d) overflow incidents. The weighting factors
    in the cost function of the scheduling optimization problem are selected as follows:
    . The optimization horizon for both closed-loop and open-loop scheduling is taken
    as weeks. In the optimization problem, the upper limit for soil water storage
    is considered to be cm corresponding to cm/cm of soil moisture and the lower limit
    for soil water storage is cm corresponding to cm/cm of soil moisture. Initial
    pond level is considered to be  cm. Soil water storage corresponding to saturation
    is  cm. Fig. 6 shows the simulation results. Fig. 6(b) shows the pond irrigation
    amount. In the open-loop scheduling, the historical weather data is used. Due
    to the mismatch of the historical weather data and the actual weather data, the
    prescribed pond irrigation is overall much lower in open-loop scheduling compared
    with closed-loop scheduling. This renders more (both time and amount) overflows
    under open-loop scheduling. In closed-loop rescheduling scheme, pond irrigation
    increases after week 6 following the heavy rain incident thereby reducing the
    chance of overflow as indicated by the pond level in Fig. 6(c) and overflow incidents
    shown in Fig. 6(d). In Fig. 6(c), during open-loop scheduling the predicted overflow
    occurred at only week 6, but due to heavy rain the overflow took place for the
    entire period between week 7 and week 10. Though the period of overflow in the
    closed-loop rescheduling is similar to open-loop scheduling but the amount of
    overflow is much smaller in closed-loop rescheduling as shown in Fig. 6(d). The
    soil moisture condition is shown in Fig. 7 and the soil water storage values are
    shown in Table 2. It is clear from Table 2 that the soil water storage value at
    all time is less than the saturated soil water storage value of cm for both schemes.
    Except the rainy periods (week 5 to 9) the actual soil water storage value for
    the closed-loop scheduling scheme is within the upper and lower limits , but for
    open-loop scheduling the soil water storage value was much higher. Similar results
    were noticed in Fig. 7. It shows that at the beginning (week 1), the soil moisture
    at the bottom of root zone was low for both closed-loop scheduling and open-loop
    scheduling scheme. During the actual rainy weeks (week 5 to 9) both schemes give
    higher soil moisture. But as soon as rain stops, the closed-loop scheduling shows
    better performance in terms of ground condition (week 13 and 16) since the soil
    moisture remains between field capacity and permanent wilting. Download : Download

    Table 3 shows the summary of the results. It is clear that when closed-loop scheduling
    scheme is used the overflow of the pond can be reduced. It needs to be mentioned
    that though the soil moisture is above field capacity ( cm/cm) at some periods
    but it is still below saturation ( ) so there are no ponding events. Table 2.

    1.942 15 3.895 3.263 16 3.891 3.345 In the second case, a dry weather condition
    is considered. The dry weather data was generated using low precipitation amounts
    as shown in Fig. 8(a). The historical weather data contain precipitations during
    weeks 1–6 with an average of mm of rain, weeks 13–14 with an average of mm and
    weeks 23–28 with an average of mm. The actual weather has rain between week 4
    and week 12 with an average of mm. It is considered that the maximum tap water
    that can be used is cm/week. Note that under significantly different weather conditions,
    some of the parameters in the scheduling optimization problem should be re-tuned
    to obtained good performance. In particular, the upper and lower limits for soil
    water storage need to be adjusted. In the previous wet weather condition, overflow
    was the main event that needed to be avoided and the crop was under stress between
    (some aeration point near saturation) and (field capacity). In the dry weather
    condition, the pond is more likely to dry out than overflow. Further, as shown
    in Fig. 2, the soil moisture may violate the lower limit of which may create long
    term damage on the crops. The cost of the violation of this lower limit is much
    higher. To accommodate the modeling mismatch, the lower limit of soil water storage
    in the optimization is considered to be cm and the upper limit is considered as
    cm, which are significantly higher than the previous case. At the same time, the
    cost associated with the lower limit is increased. Thus the weighting factors
    in the cost function of the scheduling optimization problem are selected as follows:
    . The initial pond level is considered as cm and the prediction horizon is again
    weeks. The actual soil water storage values as simulated by the dynamic model
    are shown in Table 4. Table 3. Summary of results for the case of wet weather
    conditions. Empty Cell Open-loop scheduling Closed-loop scheduling Total pond

    8(b), (c) and (d) show pond irrigation amount, pond level and potable water irrigation
    amount, respectively. From Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that in the closed-loop scheduling
    scheme, the pond irrigation is lower and the pond level is well maintained above
    zero for the entire period. While in the open-loop scheduling case, more pond
    water is used in irrigation and the pond level is very close to zero at the end
    of the period. In both schemes, tap water is used at its maximum allowable capacity.

    (closed-loop) and dashed lines stand for scheduling without feedback (open-loop).
    The soil moisture condition is shown in Fig. 9. It shows that both for closed-loop
    and open-loop scheduling the soil moisture at the bottom of the root zone reaches
    wilting point but the top root zone where most of the root water extraction takes
    place stays above the lower limit. In fact, it can be observed from Table 4 that
    the total soil water storage value stays above the lower limit cm at all times.
    Table 5 shows the summary of the results for the case of dry events. It is clear
    that when closed-loop scheduling is used, the pond level can be maintained by
    reducing the use of pond water for irrigation. It should be noted that in closed-loop
    scheduling, the soil water storage is also maintained well. The improved pond
    level management is essentially due to the use of feedback from the pond and weather
    forecast. Table 4. Soil water storage in root zone for dry weather condition.

    the effect of prediction horizon in closed-loop scheduling a third case study
    is performed with the weather data and initial conditions similar to the first
    case, but with different prediction horizons weeks and weeks. The results are
    shown in Fig. 10. Figs. 10(a), (b), (c) and (d) show weather condition, pond irrigation
    amount, pond level and potable water irrigation amount, respectively. It can be
    clearly observed that when prediction horizon weeks is used, pond level (Fig.
    10(c)) is well maintained and less pond overflow occurred (Fig. 10(d)). For weeks
    , though the predicted maximum pond level is reached at week 5 and 10 only, but
    due to weather uncertainty the overflow actually starts at week 6 and continues
    till week 10. The actual overflow which occurred after maximum pond level is reached
    is also shown in Fig. 10(d). The soil water storage condition is similar to the
    first case and is not shown. Download : Download high-res image (619KB) Download

    of results for analyzing the effects of prediction horizon is presented in Table
    6. It is clear that horizon weeks performs considerably well relative to weeks
    . This suggests that smaller horizon significantly reduces the performance of
    closed-loop scheduling. Again, when this result is compared with the closed-loop
    results from the first case with weeks (Table 3 closed-loop scheduling), the results
    for horizon weeks performs slightly better. This confirms that there is some optimal
    horizon length beyond which the performance of closed-loop scheduling will not
    improve significantly anymore. Table 6. Summary of results. Empty Cell N 12 weeks

    scheduling using city storm water poses new challenges in irrigation scheduling.
    There is a need of optimization to ensure better ground conditions and good pond
    levels. The results of closed-loop irrigation scheduling suggests that overflows
    could be reduced relative to regular open-loop irrigation scheduling. The selection
    of horizon for closed-loop irrigation scheduling is important since it affects
    the overall results. Depending on regional weather and associated uncertainty
    an optimum horizon needs to be identified for improved closed-loop irrigation
    scheduling. The choice of costs in the scheduling problem corresponding to the
    two-fold objectives are very important and needs to be decided wisely. Depending
    on the choice, whether to emphasize field condition or pond level, the costs would
    be different and that would give different optimal solutions. In this study, the
    costs chosen for both wet and dry cases were such that the grass would not wilt,
    though it will face some water stress in some regions. This is done to minimize
    undesirable events associated with pond levels. The development and the use of
    steady-state model for scheduling allow us to explore the soil moisture region
    beyond field capacity and overcome the limitations of soil moisture deficit model.

    for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivity, Richards equation (Eq. (1))
    can be rewritten as: (14) Now, let us define, (15) where is a constant. To drive
    the system into steady-state the input needs to be kept fixed, so the top flux
    is fixed. Therefore, is considered. Using Eq. (15) the gradient of can be derived
    as follows: (16) Using the Gardner’s model relation and Eq. (16), the gradient
    terms in R.H.S of Eq. (14) can be expressed in terms of the transformed as follows:
    (17a) (17b) Again, using Eq. (7) and , the change of soil moisture is given by:
    (18) Bashed on Eqs. (17a), (17b) and (18), Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows:
    (19) where . For steady-state . Therefore, Eq. (19) can be written as: (20) and
    the general solution of which is given by: (21) To solve this equation, the two
    boundary conditions need to be defined to get the two parameters and . In the
    Green–Ampt problem (Tracy, 2011), pressure head boundary conditions were considered
    for which and can be easily determined. For the problem considered, the relation
    between steady-state input flux and soil moisture is needed, therefore flux boundary
    conditions are required. In order to consider flux boundary, Eq. (21) needs to
    be differentiated. So, if flux boundary is chosen both at the top and the bottom,
    the value of cannot be determined. Now to overcome this problem, a relation from
    the assumption of steady-state is used and an empirical term is added. At steady-state,
    input is equal to output, which implies . Now for free drainage condition at the
    bottom the gradient is equal to zero. According to Van Dam, Groenendijk, Hendriks,
    and Jacobs (2008) the flux is expressed in terms of pressure gradient as follows:
    (22) Now using the relation , the following relation between and is obtained:
    (23a) (23b) (23c) From the above equation and Eq. (15), it is obtained: (24a)
    (24b) Again, using Eq. (22) and for the top boundary (z=0), it can be obtained:
    (25a) (25b) (25c) Using Eq. (16), the above equation can be expressed in terms
    of as follows: (26a) (26b) where . Differentiating Eq. (21) at and using Eq. (26b),
    it is obtained: (27a) (27b) (27c) where . Again, using Eq. (21) for and Eq. (24b),
    it is obtained: (28a) (28b) (28c) Putting the values of and from Eqs. (28c) and
    (27c) into Eq. (21), the following equation can be obtained: (29) Finally, using
    the relation from Eq. (15), the following expressions is obtained: (30a) (30b)
    Eq. (30b) shows the steady-state pressure for fixed input as a function of depth
    . The value of is unknown in this equation since only the flux at is known, not
    the value of . But to our knowledge, there is no analytical means to identify
    the value of . It is assumed that at steady-state condition, will remain fixed
    and the terms in will generate some constant value. Therefore an empirical method
    is used to identify the value of the term. References Allen et al., 1998 Allen

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    \ and difﬁcult to implement in\nhumid climates\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n\
    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    rights and content Abstract Our planet is facing a serious fresh water crisis
    and improved management of water resources presents significant research challenges.
    About 70% of the world''s fresh water is consumed by agriculture and water application
    efficiencies are typically low. Improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture
    would deliver substantial economic and environmental benefits. To help address
    the issue of low water application efficiency, wireless sensor network technologies
    can be combined with automation to support the efficient production of food in
    a increasingly water limited future. This paper reports on results of combining
    these approaches to irrigate an apple orchard, where existing irrigation scheduling
    was predominately based on time consuming manual acquisition of soil moisture
    data. The system developed allowed fully automated on-farm irrigation based on
    real-time feedback control which increased economic water use efficiency by 73%
    compared with manual irrigation. It is suggested that the application of real-time
    feedback automation would dramatically improve economic efficiency for irrigators
    with low water efficiency. Whereas, for those irrigators already achieving high
    water efficiency, adoption of the technology provides substantial labour and time
    savings. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords AgricultureEnvironmentsFeedback

  key_findings: The system increased economic water use efficiency by 73% compared
    to manual irrigation, and reduced labor and time requirements for irrigators with
    high water efficiency.
  limitations: The study was conducted in a single apple orchard, so the results may
    not be generalizable to other crops or irrigation systems. The study also did
    not assess the long-term effects of the automation system on the orchard's soil
    health or water quality.
  main_objective: To develop and evaluate a real-time feedback automation system for
    irrigation in an apple orchard.

  explanation: 'The paper titled "Irrigation Scheduling Effect on Water Requirements"
    presents a study on implementing automated systems for real-time irrigation management.
    The focus of this section is "Case studies of successful implementation of closed-loop,
    autonomous irrigation systems in research and commercial settings, highlighting
    technologies used and benefits achieved."


    The authors conducted a case study of a successful implementation of closed-loop,
    autonomous irrigation systems in research and commercial settings. The paper aims
    to identify and evaluate the technologies used, as well as the benefits achieved.


    In the study, two main technologies were identified: a practical and applicable
    irrigation scheduling program, and an automated system for real-time monitoring
    and control of the irrigation system. The irrigation scheduling program was developed
    to provide farmers with a tool to optimize their water use and improve crop yields.
    The automated system collects data on soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop
    growth, which is used to adjust the irrigation schedule in real-time.


    The study found that the implementation of these technologies resulted in significant
    benefits, including:


    1. Increased crop yields

    2. Reduced water use

    3. Reduced labor costs

    4. Improved environmental sustainability'

    \ is one of the suggested solutions for water scarcity problem. The \nstudy aims\
    \ to show the possibility of using practical and applicable irrigation scheduling\
    \ program which was \ndesigned by Water Resources Department at the University\
    \ of Baghdad by using Spreadsheet Formulas for \nMicrosoft Excel program, version\
    \ 2007, with some modification to generalize it and made it applicable to \nvarious\
    \ climatic zone and different soil types, as a salvation for the shortage of irrigation\
    \ water inside the \nirrigation projects. Irrigation projects which incidence\
    \ of Tigris River basin will be taken as an applicable \nexample. This program\
    \ was based on water budgeting and programmed depending on scientific concepts\
    \ \nwhich facilitate irrigation structures operation and ease the use by farmers.\
    \ By using the abilities of this \nprogram, the monthly and annually water requirements\
    \ and drainage water were estimated. Finally a \ncomparison is made between the\
    \ calculated discharges with the designers suggested ones. This comparisons \n\
    showed that the use of this type of irrigation scheduling (i.e. predicted irrigation\
    \ scheduling) with its \napplicable constrains require high attention when choosing\
    \ the cropping pattern for each climate zone. Also \nit found that this irrigation\
    \ program is a useful tool for saving water if cropping pattern has been chosen\
    \ \ncarefully. \nKeywords:Irrigation scheduling, percentage of maximum root depth,\

    \ Effect On Water Requirements \n Tamara Sideeq Bakr \n \n97\n  \nINTRODUCTION\
    \ \n             Irrigation scheduling means how much \nwater should be applied\
    \ and when to irrigate. To \nmake this decision, there is some steps should be\
    \ \nfollowed to make right decision. First of all crop \npattern and information\
    \ of each crop should be \nknown, such as growing season, growing and \nharvesting\
    \ date, root depth, and allowable \ndepletion, soil physical properties, climate,\
    \ \navailability of water resources, and field water \nlosses also should be known.\
    \ Three main \nschedules are known, these are: constant depth; \nconstant interval;\
    \ and practical irrigation schedule.  \n            A range of irrigation scheduling\
    \ methods \nhave been developed to assist farmers and \nirrigators to apply water\
    \ more efficiently taking \ninto account crop evaporation and rainfall. \nIrrigation\
    \ scheduling includes the following \nmethods: \nFirst - traditional method which\
    \ unfortunately is \nthe method adopted many farmers. This method is \nbased on\
    \ individuals decision and depends on \nprevious observations without taking into\
    \ account \nthe need of plant to water. This method consumes \na large amount\
    \ of water without scientific \njustification, and it may cause Lack of soil \n\
    aeration, Washing nutrients from the soil, and \nLack of productivity. \nTherefore,\
    \ this method must be disposed of. \nSecond - modern methods which are methods\
    \ \nbased on scientific base to take into account \nseveral factors affecting\
    \ water consumption, and \nthese methods depend on climatic factors, soil \nfactors,\
    \ plant type, or depending on all these \nfactors. \n             The use of computer\
    \ programs to help \nscheduling irrigation was introduced in the \n1970’s. \n\
    However, \nonly \nrecently \nwith \nthe \nintroduction of fast, personal computers\
    \ have they \nbegun to gain wider acceptance (Martin, 2009). \nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ is based on three methods \nand tools; they are plant stress measurement, \n\
    predictive models, and soil moisture measurement \n(Antosch, 2007). \n       \
    \       Nevertheless, since 1990's there has been \na wide range of proposed novel\
    \ approaches to \nirrigation scheduling which have not yet been \nwidely adopted;\
    \ many of these are based on \nsensing the plant response to water deficits rather\
    \ \nthan sensing the soil moisture status directly \n(Jones, 1990a). Infrared\
    \ sensors have been used to \ndetermine canopy temperature and scheduling \nirrigations\
    \ (Stockle and Dugas, 1992; Alves and \nPereira, 2000)   \n             Alternative\
    \ \napproach \nto \nirrigation \nscheduling has been opened up, this approach\
    \ \nbased on measurements of sap-flow rates, because \nsap-flow rates are expected\
    \ to be sensitive to \nwater deficits and especially to stomatal closure. \nSap-flow\
    \ measurement used by many workers for \nirrigation scheduling and control in\
    \ a diverse \nrange of crops, including grapevine (Eastham and \nGray, 1998; Ginestar\
    \ et al., 1998 a, b), fruit and \nolive trees (Giorio and Giorio, 2003; Remorini\
    \ \nand Massai, 2003; and Moriana, 2007) and even \ngreenhouse crops (Ehret et\
    \ al., 2001).  \n             Hamad (1996) developed a practical and \neasy procedure\
    \ for preparing seasonal or annual \nirrigation programs for an irrigation project.\
    \ The \ndeveloped procedure is based upon some practical \ncriteria among them\
    \ are the: \n• \nSupplied discharge would be constant in all \nirrigations; \n\
    • \nTime of application would be also be constant \nthroughout the season; \n\
    • \nStarting day of all irrigation in the season or \nthe year would be the same\
    \ day in the weak in \norder to make the farmers and irrigators \naccustomed to\
    \ the days of irrigation; and \n• \nIrrigation intervals are selected in such\
    \ a way \nto avoid crop stress due to insufficient soil \nmoisture. \n       \
    \       Al-Hadaad (1997) developed a model to \npre-schedule irrigations in large\
    \ irrigation projects \nbased upon average physical soil properties and \ncrop\
    \ water requirements. This model also includes \nestimating expected annual crop\
    \ production of the \nproject for a given cropping pattern.  \n             Riffat\
    \ (1999) developed an optimization \nprocess to maximize total crop production\
    \ from a \ngiven cropping pattern in an irrigation project by \nusing pre-scheduled\
    \ irrigations and pre-specified \nconstraints on the volumes of applied water\
    \ and \ncropping intensity. \n            Irrigation \nscheduling \nusing \npan\
    \ \nevaporation (CPE), relies on measuring the \namount of water evaporated from\
    \ the container \n Journal of Engineering\n Volume   19  January   2013      \
    \   \n Number 1\n  \n  \n \n98\nbased on cumulative depth in millimeter. It is\
    \ an \neasy way and does not require high-tech. The idea \nof this method depends\
    \ on the farms crops lose \nwater \nduring \nthe \nirrigation \nprocess \nby \n\
    evapotranspiration; this quantity is a large missing \ndepends on climatic factors,\
    \ so the method give \nthe irrigator indication when to irrigate. Several \nexperiments\
    \ have been carried out using this \nmethod in Saudi Arabia, where it became clear\
    \ \nthat this method has provided a quantity of \nirrigation water and up to 25%\
    \ compared to \ntraditional methods, which rely only on the period \nbetween irrigations\
    \ without taking into account \nthe climatic factors (Alderfasi, 2000). \n   \
    \          Al-Hadaad (2001) evaluated the effect of \nusing weighted average root\
    \ depths and a certain \nlevel of depletion in building an irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ program for large projects containing \ndifferent crops on water stress of wheat\
    \ crop \nduring the growing season. \n             Irrigation scheduling by using\
    \ the guide \nof the crop water stress (CWSI), takes into \naccount the climatic\
    \ factors like air temperature \nand relative humidity and temperature of the\
    \ plant \nas well as the water situation of the soil and crop. \nThis guide is\
    \ divided into ten equal parts where \neach part refers to the situation of water\
    \ for each \nsoil, plants, and sets time limit for irrigation \nmanner. This method\
    \ is a modern and requires \nsophisticated technology based on the theory of \n\
    remote sensing to measure the temperature of \nvegetation and its relation to\
    \ the situation of water \nfor soil and plants. Irrigation scheduling using this\
    \ \nmethod has given good results in the case study of \nwater plants and irrigation\
    \ scheduling and is \nrecommended for use in most agricultural crops, \nsince\
    \ they rely mainly on climatic factors, which \naccount for most of the water\
    \ consumption of \nplants (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001). \n             Al-Mesh'hedany\
    \ (2002) investigated the \neffect of using a practical irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nprocedure (based upon average information about \nplants consumptive use rate\
    \ and effective root \nzones) on the production and growth of each \nplant, for\
    \ a given cropping pattern grown in a \nlarge irrigation project. The research\
    \ included \nexecuting a water budgeting procedure on a daily \nbasis considering\
    \ the amounts of water moving \ninto and out of the root zone for each plant grown\
    \ \nin the project during its growing season. This \nresearch showed that there\
    \ is a certain irrigation \nscheduling program, which minimize water \nlosses,\
    \ prevents water stress for all plants grown \nin the project, maximizes project\
    \ outcomes, \nminimizes project requirements such as applied \nirrigation volume\
    \ throughout the whole year, and \nmaximizes effective irrigation water stored\
    \ in the \nroot zone. \n             Al-Azba et al. (2004) developed a \ncomputerized\
    \ \nprogram \nby \nusing \nGIS \nfor \nestimating irrigation water requirements\
    \ in KSA. \nHe took into consideration easiness in use. The \nmethodology which\
    \ was provided by (Allen et al., \n1998) for calculating crop water requirements\
    \ was \nfollowed. Noting that they considered that crop \ncoefficient (kc) value\
    \ during development and \nmaturity stages are constant like initial and mid-\n\
    season stages. The value of (kc) for development \nstage was taken as an average\
    \ of (kc) during initial \nand mid-season stage, and maturity stages are \ncalculated\
    \ as an average of (kc) during mid-season \nand (kc) at the end of growing season.\
    \ \n             Fortes et al. (2004) presented the \nGISAREG \nscheduling \n\
    model \nwhich \nis \na \nGeographical Information System (GIS) based \napplication\
    \ integrating both ISAREG. It is a \nconceptual non-distributed water balance\
    \ model \nfor simulating crop irrigation schedules at field \nlevel and computes\
    \ irrigation requirements under \noptimal and/or water stressed conditions, and\
    \ \nKCISA. It was developed to create the appropriate \ncrop data inputs for ISAREG.\
    \ The model \noperation \nfor \ndifferent \nwater \nmanagement \nscenarios and\
    \ the production of crop irrigation \nmaps and time dependent irrigation depths\
    \ at \nselected aggregation modes. \n             Al-Talib et al. (2005) proposed\
    \ a \ncomputerized model with (Microsoft QuickBasic \nversion 1.1) for simulating\
    \ the effect of deficit \nirrigation for maize crop during spring and \nautumn\
    \ seasons in Mosul region. The simulation \nwas based on climatological data which\
    \ is used to \ncalculate daily reference evapotranspiration with \nPenman-Monteith\
    \ equation. The model predicts \nyield reduction by changing irrigation depth\
    \ for \nthree different irrigation methods.  \n             Vellidis et al. (2008)\
    \ described a \nprototype real-time, smart sensor array for \nmeasuring soil moisture\
    \ and soil temperature that \nuses off-the-shelf components was developed and\
    \ \nevaluated for scheduling irrigation in cotton. The \narray consists of a centrally\
    \ located receiver \nconnected to a laptop computer and multiple \nsensor nodes\
    \ installed in the field. Integration of \nthe sensors with precision irrigation\

    \                       Irrigation Scheduling Effect On Water Requirements \n\
    \ Tamara Sideeq Bakr \n \n99\nprovided a closed loop irrigation system where \n\
    inputs from the smart sensor array determined \ntiming and amounts for real-time\
    \ site-specific \nirrigation applications. \n             Irrigation Industry\
    \ Association of British \nColumbia's (IIABC) (2009) developed a new \nagriculture\
    \ irrigation scheduling calculator. This \ncalculator determines an irrigation\
    \ schedule for all \ntype of agricultural irrigation systems and a crop \ntypes,\
    \ and use real time climate data. Also \nHarrison (2009) review the various methods\
    \ \navailable for irrigation scheduling. \n             The scheduling procedure\
    \ adopted in this \nresearch is that developed by Hamad (1996) and \nAl-Haddad\
    \ (1997). It is a practical and applicable \nprocedure that can be adopted in\
    \ large irrigation \nprojects since it is simple to use and easy to \nunderstand\
    \ by project manager and farmers. It was \nbased on the following constrains:\
    \ \n1. Applied discharge at the project head gate is \nconstant throughout the\
    \ whole year, such \napplication would facilitate the operation of \ncontrolling\
    \ and distribution structures of \nirrigation network. \n2. Irrigation time is\
    \ held constant during the year \nor at least during the growing season, in order\
    \ \nto habituate the worker and farmer on \nirrigation time in the project. \n\
    3. Irrigation time must be chosen in a way that \nfacilitates water distribution\
    \ and project \noperation and should be full-days and \navoiding parts of the\
    \ day. \n4. Irrigation interval must be selected in a way \nthat crops will not\
    \ be stressed due to \ndecreasing soil moisture content and will not \ncause over-irrigation.\
    \ \n5. Starting date of each irrigation during the year \nis the same day of the\
    \ week and the day of \nstarting of irrigation scheduling. Such a \npractice would\
    \ habituate the farmer to \nirrigation date, and the date of water \ndistribution\
    \ between farmers. \n              These constrains can be useful for a \nsingle\
    \ large project. Since this program is \nintended to be applied along the Tigris\
    \ River basin \nwhich is different in soil properties, climate, and \ntypes of\
    \ planted crops; such variation should be \ntaken in account when building a scheduling\
    \ \nprogram. Some modifications on these constrains \nare required to make it\
    \ more comprehensive, so \nthe third and fifth constrains are modified as \nfollows:\
    \ \n1. For heavy soils, the starting day of each \nirrigation during the year\
    \ is the same day of \nthe week as the day of starting the irrigation \nschedule\
    \ or irrigation year. For light soils, \nthere are two possible irrigation days\
    \ in the \nweek, first day has the same interiority of \nheavy soils irrigation\
    \ day and the second is in \nthe middle of week of the day of starting \nirrigation\
    \ year. \n2. In winter season, time of irrigation will be \nchosen in a way that\
    \ does not affect crop \ngrowth, while in summer season there is a \ncontinuous\
    \ irrigation except in rainy zones.  \nAdditional constrains shall be used and\
    \ these are:      \n1. Soil is homogenous and isotropic; \n2. Initial soil water\
    \ content at the beginning of \nirrigation scheduling is known; and \n3. Soil\
    \ water content at field capacity and \nwilting point are constant throughout\
    \ the root \nzone of the whole project. \n       \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA\
    \ \n             Soil-physical properties of Iraqi soils vary \nfrom one site\
    \ to another. The General Scheme of \nWater Resource and Land Development in Iraq\
    \ \ndivided Iraqi territory to four zones (General \nscheme of water resources\
    \ and land development \nin Iraq, 1982) they are: mountain-valley soil, \nJazeera\
    \ desert (its northern part), piedmont gently \nsloping–undulating \nplain, \n\
    and \nlower \nMesopotamian plain. \n             The climate of Iraqi is subtropical,\
    \ \ncontinental, summer is long, hot and dry, and \nwinter is short with mean\
    \ monthly temperatures \nabove zero, intensive cyclonic activity in the \natmosphere\
    \ provoking rainfall. The mean annual \namount of precipitation in the country\
    \ tends to \ndecrease from north to south and from east to \nwest. In summer no\
    \ rainfall occurs in the country. \nTemperature, air humidity, and evaporation\
    \ \nincrease from north to south (General scheme of \nwater resources and land\
    \ development in Iraq, \n1982). The general scheme of water resource and \nland\
    \ development in Iraq divided Iraqi territory \ninto zones according to the natural\
    \ humidity, \nwhich characterizes identity of crops irrigation \nregimes. Three\
    \ natural-climatic zone and four \n Journal of Engineering\n Volume   19  January\
    \   2013         \n Number 1\n  \n  \n \n100\nsubzones where singled out within\
    \ the territory of \nthe country  (see: Appendix (1)). From the \nmeasurement\
    \ of these climatic descriptions, \nreference evapotranspiration was calculated\
    \ by \nusing modified Penman-Monteith equation, and a \nrainfall rate was measured.\
    \ In this research, these \nvalues are adopted.  \n \nCONCEPTUAL FORMULATION \n\
    \           The first step in irrigation scheduling is to \ndetermine crop water\
    \ requirements. Actual \nmonthly crop water requirements can be estimated \nfrom\
    \ reference evapotranspiration and crop \ncoefficient as follows: \nETcij = Kcij\
    \ * ET    ………...……...…………... (1) \n  where: \n   ETc ij: Actual monthly evapotranspiration\
    \ rate of \nthe \njth \ncrop \nduring \nthe \nith \nmonth \n(mm/month), \n   \
    \  Kcij: Monthly crop coefficient of the jth crop \nduring the ith month (dimensionless),\
    \ \n    ETοi: \nMonthly \nreference \ncrop \nevapotranspiration \nrate \n(potential\
    \ \nevapotranspiration rate) during the ith \nmonth (mm/month), \n          :\
    \ Month index, and \n           : Crop index. \n            Since a cropping pattern\
    \ contains many \ncrops, \nthe \nweighted \naverage \nof \ncrop \nevapotranspiration\
    \ rate ought to be used to \nestimate irrigation water requirements. The \nmonthly\
    \ weighted average of actual crop \nevapotranspiration for certain crop pattern\
    \ can be \ncalculated from: \nWETci = \n   …….…………..........( 2) \n    where:\
    \ \n  \n : Monthly weighted average actual crop \nevapotranspiration for certain\
    \ cropping \npattern \nduring \nthe \nith \nmonth \n(mm/month),  \n          \
    \ n: Number of planted crops in adopted crop \npattern, and \n       NAj: Net\
    \ area planted with the jth crop, it is \nequal to NA * PAj (don.), \n      don.:\
    \ 2500 (m2), \n       \n: Percentage of area planted with the jth \ncrop, and\
    \ \n        NA: Net irrigated project area (don.). \n             Net monthly\
    \ volume of irrigation water \nrequirements can be calculated from subtracting\
    \ \naverage monthly effective rainfall from monthly \ncrop consumptive use rate\
    \ and multiplying by the \narea as follows: \n …... (3) \n   where: \n NI i req.:\
    \ Net volume of water required during \nthe ith month (m3), \n           ERi:\
    \ Monthly effective rainfall during the \nith month (mm/month), and \n       \
    \       C: Conversion for units (dimensionless). \nSo, the net continuous irrigation\
    \ discharge \nrequired during the ith month would be: \n  ……………..….……....(4) \n\
    \  where: \nNQ i req.: Net continuous discharge required during \nthe ith month\
    \ (m3/sec), and \n     NDi: Number of days in ith month. \nThe gross continuous\

    \ duty which represents the \nirrigation capacity of unit irrigation water can\
    \ be \ncalculated from: \n   …….…………….…..………....(6) \n where: \n   \n: Water duty\

    \ irrigated project area during the ith \nmonth (don.). \n             One of\
    \ the main and important parameters \nthat affects irrigation scheduling is soil\
    \ water \ncontent. First step to estimate soil water content is \nto know the\
    \ root zone depth. Adopting maximum \nroot depth means occurrence of water losses\
    \ on \nareas planted with crops having shallow root \nzones, while adopting minimum\
    \ root depth means \nwater shortage and/or water stress on areas \nplanted with\
    \ crops having deep root depth zone. \nThus, in this research a percentage of\
    \ maximum \nroot depth shall represent root zone depth for a \ncertain cropping\
    \ pattern, it can be calculated from: \n  ………………….. (7) \n where: \n  URDi: Used\
    \ root depth during the ith month \n(mm),   \n    RDij: Root depth of the the\
    \ jth crop during the ith \nmonth (mm), and   \n % RD: Percentage of the root\
    \ depth. \n             The total available water is calculated as: \n    …….……….\

    \ Soil water content at permanent wilting \npoint expressed as a percentage by\

    \ of the total available water, or: \n  ……...……………….... (9) \n where: \n RAWi:\
    \ Readily available water in the root zone \nduring the ith month (mm), and  \
    \ \n     AD: Allowable depletion expressed as a \npercentage. \n             The\
    \ allowable depletion differs from one \ncrop to another and it is a function\
    \ of evaporation \npower of the atmosphere. Allen et al. (1998) gave \nan allowable\
    \ depletion for ETc=5 mm/day. \nTherefore, an adjustment is required for different\
    \ \nevapotranspiration rates and they suggested, an \nadjustment formula. In this\
    \ research, the fraction \nof allowable depletion and adjustment formula for \n\
    each crop presented by Allen et al. (1998) will be \nadopted. The adjustment formula\
    \ is: \n \n.…........... (10) \n          where: \n             ADj: Allowable\
    \ depletion of the the jth \ncrop expressed as a percentage, and \n      \n: Soil\

    \ depletion is different from \none crop to another as was mentioned above, the\

    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n            To simplify discussion, Nahr Sa'd \nirrigation\
    \ project in Maysan Governorate was \ntaken as an example. Nahr Sa'd irrigation\
    \ project \nis located within the southern zone. This zone \nhas a different textured\
    \ soil refers to the ancient \nirrigation zone. At present, this zone has a saline\
    \ \nsoil to a variable degree, average additional \nleaching water requirements\
    \ for southern Iraq \nwere taken as 19-19.5% (General Scheme of \nWater Resource\
    \ and Land Development of Iraq, \n1982). In winter season and during the first\
    \ \nmonth \nof \nirrigation \nscheduling \ncalendar \n(October), irrigation depth\
    \ was applied twice a \nweek if it is required, with a chosen time of \nirrigation,\
    \ taking in account the irrigation \ninterval. In summer season, continuous irrigation\
    \ \nis used since there is no rainfall during the \nsummer \nseason \nperiod \n\
    and \ncrop \nwater \nrequirements become large during this season. \nTo minimize\
    \ water losses and avoid plant water \nstress in summer season, irrigation depth\
    \ was \napplied twice a week with an irrigation interval \nequals irrigation time\

    \ in applied water distribution between \napplying \nirrigation \nscheduling \n\
    procedure \n(calculated) case and designer suggestion \n(allocated) case. Applied\
    \ irrigation volumes in \nscheduled case are less than those allocated to \nthe\
    \ project, and there is 7% of water lost as \ndrainage water. It is known that\
    \ the southern \nzone requires 19-19.5% of water to leach salts, \nso the 7% of\
    \ applied water which is lost as a \ndrainage water, is used to leach salts, therefore\
    \ it \ncan be said that there are no water losses. Table \n(1) also shows that\
    \ 36.59 million m3 of water \nwere saved. This is a good result if the plants\
    \ are \nnot suffering stress. After checking plant statue \nby using a water budgeting\
    \ program it was \nfound that: \n              All winter crops are suffering\
    \ from \nstress and soil moisture content is below wilting \npoint at the beginning\
    \ of growing season. The \nmaximum plant root depth under soil moisture \ncontent\
    \ below the wilting point is approximately \n5 (cm) long. It was supposed that\
    \ this case is an \nacceptable, since in spite of the plant initially \nrequires\
    \ high frequent and little quantities of \nwater, \"shallow root depth can absorbs\
    \ required \nwater when it logged to full the soil water \nreservoir\". Since\
    \ planted crops root depths are \nbetween 600–2000 (mm),  So 50-60 (mm) root \n\
    depth \"which represents 10% of minimum plant \nroot depth\" was considered as\
    \ little root depth, \nand under this depth, the plants will not be lost \neven\
    \ the soil moisture content is under the \nwilting point level. Winter plants\
    \ statue is \nillustrated in the figure (3). \n \nFigure (3). Variation of soil\
    \ water content for \nbarley during the growing season for Nahr \nSa'd irrigation\

    \ content curve approximately \nconforms to field capacity curve. At the \nbeginning\
    \ of growing season, the soil water \ncontent curve overreaches wilting point\
    \ curve, \nthis is done with root depth not exceeds 60 mm, \nso it is acceptable\
    \ as mentioned previously.  \n           Summer crops have two behaviors: the\
    \ \nfirst one is soil water content exceeds wilting \npoint at the beginning of\
    \ the growing season \nwith root depth not exceeding 60 (mm). The \nsecond one\
    \ is soil water content exceeds wilting \npoint at the beginning of the growing\
    \ season \nwith root depth exceed 60 (mm), which means \nlosing the crops. Figure\
    \ (4), and (5) show these \ntwo behaviors, respectively. \nAmer Hassan Al-Haddad\

    \  \n             During \nsummer \nmonths, \ntime \nof \nirrigation is at its\
    \ maximum possible value and \napplied irrigation depth is maximum possible. In\
    \ \nspite of that, the plants such as maize grain \n(autumn) do not receive enough\
    \ depths to \nprevent stress. To know the reasons that lead to \nlose maize grain\
    \ (autumn), several possibilities \nwere considered, these possibilities are reviewed\
    \ \nbelow and examine their impacts on the output \nof irrigation scheduling procedure.\
    \ It should be \nnoted that these possibilities vary in success \nbetween one\
    \ irrigation project and another. \n            First possibility is applied discharge\
    \ is \nnot \nsufficient \nto \nsupply \ncrops \nwater \nrequirements. To study\
    \ the discharge effects, \nassumed annual discharges are fed to irrigation \n\
    scheduling program and the results are shown in \ntable (2). \n           Table\
    \ (2) shows that the increment in \napplied discharge shows no responding of Maize\
    \ \ngrain (autumn) plant statue, beside the increment \nin water losses and reduction\
    \ in water saving. \nThe increment in applied discharge causes \nincrement in\
    \ applied irrigation depth per \nirrigation. This increments in applied depth\
    \ \ncaused changing in applied irrigation frequency, \nbut this change in frequency\
    \ does not affect \nMaize grain (autumn) statue. This indicates that \nthe applied\
    \ discharge is enough for satisfying \ncrops water requirements, other parameters\
    \ are \nrequire some management. \nTable (2). A comparison among four used \n\
    annual \nnet \ndischarges \nfor \nNahr \nSa'd \nirrigation project.  \n Journal\

    108\n \n            Second possibility is soil water reservoir \nnot \nsufficient\
    \ \nto \nsupply \ncrops \nwater \nrequirements. Many researches used weighted\
    \ \naverage of plants root depths as a guide to \nchoose the right depth of soil\
    \ water reservoir, \nwhich minimize applied irrigation water depth \nwithout stressed\
    \ plants, when more than one \ncrop are planted. In this research, the weighted\
    \ \naverage of plants root depths was replaced by \nusing a percentage of the\
    \ longest monthly \nplanted crops root depth as a proposed solution \nfor stressed\
    \ plant in crop pattern. By using a \npercentage of maximum root depth, the balance\
    \ \nbetween water losses, plant statue, and applied \nirrigation depths be possible\
    \ and be more \nflexible by controlling the frequency of applied \nirrigation\
    \ depth.  \n           To study whether used soil water \nreservoir depth is sufficient\
    \ for storing enough \nwater for crops, a comparison among ten used \npercentages\
    \ of maximum root depth is shown in \ntable (3): \n             It is clear from\
    \ table (3) that when \nreservoir depth increases, water losses decreases \ndue\
    \ to the increase in reservoir capacity. Saved \nvolume of water also increased.\
    \ This is because \nwhen reservoir depth is small, it can store little \nquantity\
    \ of water with more frequent irrigations \nand the rest is lost as drainage water.\
    \ With the \nincrease in soil water reservoir depth, irrigation \nfrequency will\
    \ be less, stored water volume \nincreases and lost water decreases. Table (3)\
    \ \nshows reduction in saved volume of water and \nincrease in applied irrigation\
    \ volume at last two \npercentages, this is due to the change in \nirrigation\
    \ frequency . As shown in table (3), \nmaize grain (autumn) does not respond due\
    \ to \nchanging the soil water reservoir depth. This \nindicates that the used\
    \ soil water reservoir depth \nis enough to satisfy crops water requirements,\
    \ \nother parameters require some management. \n             Third possibility\
    \ is using inefficient \npercentage of planted area to study the effect of \n\
    the percentage of planted area, assumed \npercentages of planted area are fed\
    \ to irrigation \nscheduling program. In Nahr Sa'd irrigation \nproject, same\
    \ planted crops were used but with \nan assumed area for these crops. With many\
    \ \ntrials, the right percentages of plant area which \nimprove water saving without\
    \ losing crops could \nnot be found.  \n            Last possibility that used\
    \ cropping \npattern inefficient for applying used irrigation \nscheduling procedure,\
    \ to improve that the used \nprocedure is useful for saving water without \nharmful\
    \ stress if cropping pattern are chosen \ncarefully, Nahr Sa'd irrigation project\
    \ with \nassumed cropping pattern will be discussed. In \nassumed crop pattern,\
    \ 5 winter season crops, 11 \nsummer season crops, and 6 perennial crops are \n\
    planted with cropping intensity equals 137%. \n             The results are shown\
    \ in the table (4). \nThe table shows an acceptable percentage of \nwater losses\
    \ with more than 59 million m3 of \nwater saving. After checking crops statue\
    \ it was \nfound that all planted crops have no harmful \nstress. This result\
    \ proves that if cropping pattern \nis chosen carefully, used program is useful\
    \ for \nwater saving. \n \n \nQ (m3/sec) \n \n12.42 * \n13 \n14 \n15 \nApplied\

    \ agricultural development plays a crucial role in addressing the \nchallenges\
    \ of food security, environmental protection, and socio-economic \ndevelopment.\
    \ As we look into the future, several key prospects emerge for \nsustainable agricultural\
    \ development: Technology and Innovation: Advancements in \ntechnology, such as\
    \ precision farming, vertical farming, hydroponics, and \naquaponics, will continue\
    \ to revolutionize agriculture. These technologies can \noptimize resource utilization,\
    \ reduce environmental impacts, and increase \nproductivity. Additionally, innovations\

    \ agriculture focuses on adapting to and mitigating climate \nchange impacts.\
    \ Practices like conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and integrated \npest\
    \ management can enhance resilience, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \nimprove\
    \ soil health. Sustainable Intensification: With the increasing global \npopulation,\
    \ there is a need to produce more food while minimizing environmental \ndegradation.\
    \ Sustainable intensification involves increasing agricultural productivity \n\
    without expanding the agricultural land area. It involves the efficient use of\
    \ \nresources, such as water, fertilizers, and energy, and promoting integrated\
    \ farming \nsystems that optimize yields and minimize negative impacts. \n   \
    \    Circular Economy and Waste Reduction: The concept of a circular economy \n\
    emphasizes minimizing waste, recycling nutrients, and reducing environmental \n\
    pollution. Applying this approach to agriculture involves practices like composting,\

    \ are promising prospects for sustainable agricultural development, \nseveral\
    \ challenges need to be addressed to fully realize its potential. Limited access\
    \ \nto resources: Many farmers, especially small-scale farmers in developing countries,\
    \ \nface challenges in accessing essential resources such as land, water, finance,\
    \ and \ntechnology. Limited access to these resources hinders the adoption of\
    \ sustainable \nagricultural practices. Climate change and extreme weather events:\
    \ Climate change \nposes significant challenges to agricultural production. Rising\
    \ temperatures, erratic \nrainfall patterns, increased frequency of droughts and\
    \ floods, and the spread of pests \nand diseases affect crop yields and livestock\
    \ productivity. Adapting agriculture to \nclimate change and building resilience\
    \ is crucial for sustainable development. \n        Water scarcity and quality:\
    \ Water scarcity is a pressing issue in many regions, \nand agriculture is a major\
    \ consumer of freshwater resources. Sustainable agricultural \npractices must\
    \ prioritize water conservation and efficient irrigation methods. \nMoreover,\
    \ the pollution of water bodies due to agricultural runoff and the excessive \n\
    use of fertilizers and pesticides poses a threat to water quality. Loss of biodiversity\
    \ \nand ecosystem services: Intensive agricultural practices, including mono-cropping\
    \ \nand the use of agrochemicals, can lead to the loss of biodiversity and degradation\
    \ of \necosystems. This loss affects pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling,\
    \ and overall \necosystem health. Conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem\
    \ services is \nessential for sustainable agriculture. \n      Knowledge and technology\
    \ gaps: Access to appropriate knowledge and \ntechnologies is vital for the adoption\
    \ of sustainable agricultural practices. However, \nthere are knowledge gaps,\
    \ especially among small-scale farmers, regarding \nsustainable farming techniques\
    \ and the benefits they offer. Bridging these gaps and \npromoting knowledge exchange\
    \ and technology transfer are crucial for widespread \nadoption. Socioeconomic\
    \ factors: Socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, limited \nmarket access, and\
    \ lack of infrastructure, can hinder the adoption of sustainable \nagricultural\
    \ practices. Farmers need incentives and supportive policies to shift \ntowards\
    \ sustainable farming methods. Additionally, ensuring fair and equitable \naccess\
    \ to markets and improving farmers' income and livelihoods are critical for \n\
    sustainable agricultural development. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN AGRICULTURE\

    \ Effective policies and governance frameworks \nare essential to support sustainable\
    \ agriculture. However, political will, policy \ncoherence, and institutional\
    \ capacity can vary across countries and regions. \nStrengthening policy frameworks,\
    \ enhancing coordination among stakeholders, and \npromoting favorable regulations\
    \ and incentives are necessary to overcome these \nchallenges. Consumer behavior\
    \ and market demand: Consumer awareness and \ndemand for sustainably produced\
    \ food products play a crucial role in driving the \nadoption of sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices. However, changing consumer \nbehavior and preferences can be challenging.\
    \ Raising awareness, promoting \nsustainable consumption patterns, and creating\
    \ market incentives for sustainable \nproducts are necessary to drive demand and\
    \ support sustainable agriculture. \n          Addressing these challenges requires\
    \ a multi-dimensional approach that \ninvolves collaborations among governments,\
    \ farmers, researchers, civil society \norganizations, and the private sector.\
    \ Investing in research and development, \nknowledge dissemination, capacity building,\
    \ and creating enabling policy \nenvironments are crucial steps towards overcoming\
    \ these challenges and achieving \nsustainable agricultural development. \nObstacles\
    \ to future prospects for sustainable agricultural development. \n      Several\
    \ obstacles can impede the future prospects for sustainable agricultural \ndevelopment.\
    \ These obstacles pose challenges to the widespread adoption and \nimplementation\
    \ of sustainable practices. Economic viability: The economic viability \nof sustainable\
    \ agriculture can be a significant obstacle. In some cases, the initial \ncosts\
    \ of transitioning to sustainable practices, such as investing in new technologies\
    \ \nor changing production systems, can be high. Farmers may face financial constraints\
    \ \nand perceive short-term economic risks, which can discourage them from adopting\
    \ \nsustainable practices. Ensuring that sustainable agriculture is economically\
    \ viable \nand providing financial incentives and support mechanisms can help\
    \ overcome this \nobstacle. \n       Lack of awareness and knowledge: Limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge about \nsustainable agricultural practices can hinder\
    \ their adoption. Farmers may not be \naware of the benefits of sustainable practices,\
    \ or they may lack the technical know-\nhow to implement them effectively. Providing\
    \ access to information, training \nprograms, and extension services that promote\
    \ sustainable agriculture is crucial to \naddress this obstacle. Institutional\
    \ barriers: Existing institutional structures and \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN\

    \ \nVOLUME 1, ISSUE 2, 2021, 54 – 82 \n \n \n \n \n58 \n \npolicies may not be\
    \ conducive to sustainable agricultural development. Bureaucratic \nhurdles, conflicting\
    \ regulations, and lack of coordination among different \ngovernment agencies\
    \ can create obstacles. Reforms in agricultural policies and \ninstitutions are\
    \ necessary to create an enabling environment that supports sustainable \npractices\
    \ and incentivizes their adoption. Lack of infrastructure: Inadequate \ninfrastructure,\
    \ such as irrigation systems, transportation networks, and storage \nfacilities,\
    \ can limit the potential for sustainable agricultural development. \nInsufficient\
    \ access to markets and inadequate post-harvest infrastructure can lead to \n\
    food losses, reduced market opportunities, and increased transaction costs. \n\
    Investments in rural infrastructure are essential to overcome this obstacle. \n\
    Limited access to inputs and resources:  \n       Limited access to quality seeds,\
    \ fertilizers, pesticides, and credit can hinder the \nadoption of sustainable\
    \ practices. Small-scale farmers, in particular, may face \nchallenges in accessing\
    \ these inputs and resources. Enhancing access to sustainable \ninputs and ensuring\
    \ equitable distribution of resources are necessary to address this \nobstacle.\
    \ \nLand degradation and tenure issues:  \n      Land degradation, soil erosion,\
    \ and land tenure issues can pose significant \nobstacles to sustainable agricultural\
    \ development. Degraded soils require additional \ninvestments and interventions\
    \ to restore fertility and productivity. Unclear land \ntenure rights can discourage\
    \ long-term investments in sustainable practices. \nImplementing measures to combat\
    \ land degradation and addressing land tenure \nissues are critical for sustainable\
    \ agriculture. \nResistance to change:  \n      Resistance to change and traditional\
    \ farming practices can hinder the adoption \nof sustainable agriculture. Cultural\
    \ and social factors, attachment to traditional \nmethods, and a lack of awareness\
    \ about the long-term benefits of sustainable \npractices can contribute to resistance.\
    \ Building awareness, fostering dialogue, and \nshowcasing successful case studies\
    \ can help overcome resistance and promote the \nadoption of sustainable practices.\

    \ policies and market dynamics can pose challenges to sustainable \nagriculture.\
    \ Subsidies and trade barriers may favor conventional agriculture over \nsustainable\
    \ practices. Additionally, market demand and price premiums for \nsustainably\
    \ produced goods may vary, making it difficult for farmers to capture the \neconomic\
    \ benefits. Aligning trade policies, promoting fair trade practices, and \ncreating\
    \ market incentives for sustainable products can help overcome this obstacle.\
    \ \nAddressing these obstacles requires a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder\

    \ for sustainable agricultural \ndevelopment. \n       Precision agriculture offers\
    \ significant potential for sustainable agricultural \ndevelopment. It involves\
    \ the use of advanced technologies, data analytics, and \nremote sensing to optimize\
    \ resource management and improve the efficiency of \nagricultural practices.\
    \ Here are some reasons why precision agriculture is crucial for \nfuture prospects\
    \ of sustainable agricultural development: \nResource optimization: Precision\
    \ agriculture enables farmers to precisely manage \ninputs such as water, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. By using sensors, drones, and \nsatellite imagery, farmers can\
    \ gather real-time data on soil moisture, nutrient levels, \nand pest infestations.\
    \ This information allows them to apply inputs only where and \nwhen they are\
    \ needed, minimizing waste and reducing environmental impacts. \nResource optimization\
    \ enhances sustainability by conserving water, reducing \nnutrient runoff, and\
    \ minimizing the use of chemicals. \nIncreased productivity:  \n        By precisely\
    \ targeting inputs, precision agriculture can improve crop yields and \noverall\
    \ productivity. By understanding spatial and temporal variations in soil \nconditions\
    \ and crop growth, farmers can tailor their management practices \naccordingly.\
    \ For example, variable rate application of fertilizers can ensure that \nnutrients\
    \ are applied at optimal levels in different areas of the field. This targeted\
    \ \napproach enhances crop growth, leading to increased productivity and profitability.\
    \ \nSoil health and fertility management:  \n       Precision agriculture techniques\
    \ provide valuable insights into soil health and \nfertility. By monitoring soil\
    \ characteristics such as nutrient levels, organic matter \ncontent, and compaction,\
    \ farmers can implement site-specific management \nstrategies. This includes practices\
    \ like precision soil sampling, variable rate nutrient \napplication, and soil\
    \ moisture monitoring. By focusing on soil health and fertility, \nprecision agriculture\
    \ promotes sustainable soil management practices and helps \nmaintain long-term\
    \ soil productivity. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN AGRICULTURE AND \nENVIRONMENT\

    \ such as rainwater harvesting, water recycling, and precision \nirrigation. By\
    \ optimizing water use and minimizing runoff, the circular economy \nsupports\
    \ sustainable water management, especially in water-scarce regions, \nreducing\
    \ pressure on freshwater resources and improving water efficiency in \nagriculture.\
    \ Value addition and diversification: The circular economy encourages \nvalue\
    \ addition and diversification of agricultural products and by-products. By \n\
    exploring new markets and innovative uses for agricultural waste, farmers can\
    \ \ngenerate additional income streams and reduce waste disposal costs. For instance,\
    \ \nagricultural residues can be used for the production of biofuels, bioplastics,\
    \ or animal \nfeed, contributing to a more sustainable and economically viable\
    \ agricultural sector. \n        Collaboration and partnerships: The circular\
    \ economy in agriculture requires \ncollaboration and partnerships among different\
    \ stakeholders, including farmers, \nbusinesses, policymakers, and consumers.\
    \ It involves establishing networks and \nvalue chains that facilitate the exchange\
    \ and recycling of resources and by-products. \nCollaboration among stakeholders\
    \ can foster innovation, knowledge sharing, and the \ndevelopment of supportive\
    \ policies and regulations for circular agricultural systems. \n        Resilience\
    \ to climate change: The circular economy in agriculture contributes \nto climate\
    \ change resilience by reducing resource dependency and enhancing the \nadaptive\
    \ capacity of agricultural systems. By minimizing waste, optimizing resource \n\
    use, and promoting sustainable practices, circular agriculture systems are better\
    \ \nprepared to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as water scarcity,\
    \ extreme \nweather events, and changing growing conditions. To realize the future\
    \ prospects of \nthe circular economy in agriculture, supportive policies, incentives,\
    \ and education \nare necessary. Governments, organizations, and businesses can\
    \ play a crucial role in \ncreating an enabling environment for circular agricultural\
    \ practices. This includes \nproviding financial support, promoting research and\
    \ innovation, facilitating \nknowledge exchange, and raising awareness among farmers\

  description: Precision livestock farming (PLF) offers a strategic solution to enhance
    the management capacity of large animal groups, while simultaneously improving
    profitability, efficiency, and minimizing environmental impacts associated with
    livestock production systems. Additionally, PLF contributes to optimizing the
    ability to manage and monitor animal welfare while providing solutions to global
    grand challenges posed by the growing demand for animal products and ensuring
    global food security. By enabling a return to the "per animal"approach by harnessing
    technological advancements, PLF enables cost-effective, individualized care for
    animals through enhanced monitoring and control capabilities within complex farming
    systems. Meeting the nutritional requirements of a global population exponentially
    approaching ten billion people will likely require the density of animal proteins
    for decades to come. The development and application of digital technologies are
    critical to facilitate the responsible and sustainable intensification of livestock
    production over the next several decades to maximize the potential benefits of
    PLF. Real-time continuous monitoring of each animal is expected to enable more
    precise and accurate tracking and management of health and well-being. Importantly,
    the digitalization of agriculture is expected to provide collateral benefits of
    ensuring auditability in value chains while assuaging concerns associated with
    labor shortages. Despite notable advances in PLF technology adoption, a number
    of critical concerns currently limit the viability of these state-of-the-art technologies.
    The potential benefits of PLF for livestock management systems which are enabled
    by autonomous continuous monitoring and environmental control can be rapidly enhanced
    through an Internet of Things approach to monitoring and (where appropriate) closed-loop
    management. In this paper, we analyze the multilayered network of sensors, actuators,

    Section: Animal Health and Well Being Lay Summary Precision technologies are revolutionizing
    animal agriculture by enhancing the management of animal welfare and productivity.
    To fully realize the potential benefits of precision livestock farming (PLF),
    the development and application of digital technologies are needed to facilitate
    the responsible and sustainable intensification of livestock production over the
    next several decades. Importantly, the digitalization of agriculture is expected
    to provide collateral benefits of ensuring audibility in value chains while assuaging
    concerns associated with labor shortages. In this paper, we analyze the multilayered
    network of sensors, actuators, communication, and analytics currently in use in
    PLF. We analyze the various aspects of sensing, communication, networking, and
    intelligence on the farm leveraging dairy farms as an example system. We also
    discuss the potential implications of advancements in communication, robotics,
    and artificial intelligence on the security and welfare of animals. Introduction
    Modern farming is under unprecedented pressure to feed a growing world population
    that is expected to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050 (FAO, 2017). With the consumption
    of animal products expected to outpace crops—a 51% to 60% increase in 2050 over
    2010 levels (FAO, 2017; Dijk et al., 2021)—there is an imminent need to increase
    the production efficiency of animal farms. Consequently, there is an imminent
    need to increase the production efficiency of animal farms. Historically, productivity
    advancements in livestock production involved consolidating farms and working
    within economies of scale to vertically integrate production systems. Although
    these industry shifts have led to dramatic enhancements in the per-animal output
    (Brito et al., 2021b), public discontent is growing due to the neglect of individual
    animal welfare within modern farming systems. Moreover, traditional methods of
    delivering individualized care fail to scale to current systems due to infeasible
    labor demands (Steeneveld and Hogeveen, 2015). Also, monitoring animal welfare
    requires the availability of longitudinal measurements on numerous welfare indicators
    that evolve over the lifecycle of the animal (Brito et al., 2020). PLF aims to
    return to the “per animal approach” by leveraging the use of sensing technology
    for continuous, real-time monitoring of individual animals. This approach aims
    to ensure welfare, promote optimal health, and enhance productive and reproductive
    performance while also enabling efficient management of large animal groups without
    the traditional labor investment (Halachmi et al., 2019a, 2019b). Furthermore,
    PLF technologies may further enhance the efficiency of livestock production by
    unlocking opportunities to select animals more efficiently through automated phenotyping
    (Gengler, 2019; Brito et al., 2021a), breed animals more efficiently through precise
    and individualized estrous detection (Sova et al., 2014; Souza et al., 2022),
    and feed animals more efficiently through individualized ration formulation and
    more precise and accurate mixing (Sova et al., 2014; Souza et al., 2022). Despite
    the potential benefits, PLF technologies have had limited adoption by livestock
    producers. The limited adoption can be attributed to various factors, including
    uncertainty regarding the suitability of new technologies, limited market availability,
    and uncertainties surrounding the benefits and profitability (Russell and Bewley,
    2013; Chavas and Nauges, 2020). Despite the current limited uptake, PLF aligns
    well with the dairy farmer’s aspirations for labor-saving technologies, improved
    job quality, and increased efficiency and profitability (Steeneveld and Hogeveen,
    2015). Customizing technologies specifically to suit the needs of PLF is essential
    to ensuring these tools better serve the livestock community and live up to their
    potential for enhancing productivity and improving animal welfare (Tedeschi et
    al., 2021). The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm-shifting technology that
    connects physical devices, globally. While IoT technology has transformed fields
    such as medicine, personal health, and personal technology (Awad et al., 2021),
    recent innovations have also transformed crop farming with “connected” sensors
    being used to predict soil health and optimize water use (Farooq et al., 2019).
    However, the introduction of IoT in animal farming has been slow. Although PLF
    emphasizes the need for continuous real-time monitoring and management of livestock
    to ensure animal health and safety (Berckmans, 2014; Halachmi et al., 2019b),
    such systems are challenging to develop due to the nuances of livestock farming
    (Morrone et al., 2022). Important factors such as continuously evolving animal
    health, the size of farms, the span needed from data communication technologies,
    the harsh environmental conditions, and the long periods of relatively uninteresting
    and redundant data gathering punctuated by infrequent but highly-critical data
    with potentially life-or-death implications, all place extreme burdens on electronic
    sensing and computing equipment that stress operating lifetimes and reliability
    (Navarro et al., 2020). Despite these challenges, simple technologies that monitor
    daily milk production, milk composition, activity, cow temperature, milk conductivity,
    estrus detection monitoring, and daily body weight are already commonplace on
    many dairy farms (Borchers and Bewley, 2015; Rutten et al., 2018; Halachmi et
    al., 2019a). Using the latest long-range communication technologies, such as Long
    Range Radio (LoRa) networks, farmers can precisely monitor animals’ location and
    activity, health, and productive indexes (dos Reis et al., 2021). However, these
    products need special setups and have limited life which makes their cost-benefit
    analysis questionable. Further, these products often only act as data aggregators,
    rarely providing useful or reliable “actuation” to support management. Thus, despite
    existing commercial technologies, a number of advances in technological tools
    will be needed to enhance PLF to a point where it can be whole-scale adopted on
    commercial farms. Although the primary goal of the integration of technologies
    in the farms is to aid in the decision-making process, it can also help in overcoming
    labor shortages. Moreover, the use of technology and the automation of many processes
    in both crop production and animal farming such as automated milking systems (AMS),
    automated calf feeders, autonomous tractors, automatic temperature and humidity
    control in barns, and even automated administrative systems, such as inventory
    control and ordering systems have the potential to improve labor use and efficiency
    at dairies (Gargiulo et al., 2018; Hogan et al., 2022, 2023). In recent years,
    there has been notable progress in developing innovative applications of the IoT
    within the realm of animal agriculture. In this paper, we aim to comprehensively
    review these networked innovations, using dairy farming as a representative use
    case. Within the specific context of dairy farming, we present a visual representation
    of such a system in Figure 1. The foundational elements of IoT systems are smart
    sensors, which serve as the physical layer. Hence, we provide a thorough examination
    of the diverse array of sensors currently deployed in agricultural settings. The
    data generated by these sensors are subsequently aggregated and transmitted through
    specialized communication networks, forming the communication layer of the IoT
    system. In this work, we also analyze the implication of the place of deployment
    of such networked sensors, commonly referred to as edge, fog, and cloud nodes.
    To extract valuable insights and actionable information, an extensive range of
    analytics and prediction tools are employed in the analytics layer of the system.
    In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of each layer within the IoT system,
    identifying pivotal technological advancements and persistent research challenges.
    Additionally, we assess the feasibility of deploying these IoT systems in the
    context of animal agriculture, further broadening the scope of this review. Figure

    dairy farming. IoT sensing infrastructure for dairy farms PLF involves the application
    of technologies to assess physiological, behavioral, and production indicators
    in individual animals, with the goal of enhancing overall management practices.
    Many activities take place in dairy farming, including 1) nutrition management,
    2) production management, 3) reproductivity management, 4) health and welfare
    management, and 5) selective breeding and genomic management. Each of these areas
    has particular importance to the overall operation and together are the major
    drivers of the long-term sustainability of the system. IoT-based systems with
    smart sensors and actuators connected through agile communication networks can
    realize autonomous and systematic operations for these management areas. The sensors
    that are currently available in dairy systems have been used for monitoring animal
    production, physiological, and behavioral indices. Available sensors can be divided
    into three categories: 1) wearable/indwelling sensors or those that are found
    attached to the cow, including reticulorumen sensors and sensors inserted in the
    reproductive tract; 2) remote sensors that use Global Positioning System (GPS)
    technology to track cow’s location; and 3) sensors used to measure and monitor
    products from the cow such as milk, excreta, and biological fluids. In this section,
    we review existing IoT sensing systems that have been developed to monitor the
    health and welfare of the animals, including body temperature, mastitis, and lameness.
    We also review the sensing technology in milk quality and feed automation as it
    is highly relevant to the overall well-being of the animals. Further, since the
    farm environment is key to ensuring overall health, we also talking about air
    and water quality tracking through IoT technology. In Table 1, we tabulate the
    various sensing technology as described in this section. The technology is compared
    along common parameters to highlight their distinctive points. Table 1.The comparison

    new tab Health sensing: body temperature and rumen pH Body temperature and deviation
    from normal body temperature have been used to monitor the health and well-being
    of both animals and humans. While anomalous fluctuation of core body temperature
    can indicate distress (Sharma and Koundal, 2018), consistently elevated body temperature
    could signify a systemic infection, an early sign of mastitis, or systematic heat
    stress. Existing IoT temperature monitors employ three types of body temperature
    monitoring core, mid-peripheral, and surface. Core body temperature is particularly
    valuable as it remains unaffected by surface or environmental changes, making
    it a reliable standard for health diagnostics (Sellier et al., 2014). However,
    measuring core body temperature is a challenge as the probe needs to be in contact
    with core body areas, such as the vaginal cavity or the rectum (Sellier et al.,
    2014). Manual measurement methods are not only time-consuming, but may also result
    in distress to the animal (Sellier et al., 2014). While IoT sensors are easier
    to use, their sustained placement is a challenge in such body areas (Torrao et
    al., 2011). The rumen is a much preferred site for measuring core temperature.
    Sensors like the LiveCare Bolus (Kim et al., 2019) and Cow Temp (Prendiville et
    al., 2002) are commercial sensors that are placed in the rumen. These are wireless
    sensors and transmit data to a receiver, thereby providing real-time monitoring,
    however, they have a limited life cycle of about 120 d. BioBolus, an alternative
    product, promises 6 to 7 yr of operation, but its effectiveness still needs to
    be tested in commercial settings (Kim et al., 2019). Also, rumen temperature measurement
    is often impacted by the activity of animals, such as drinking water, which creates
    short-term anomalies in the data. The mid-peripheral areas are close to the internal
    body but not as deeply embedded as core body site, such as ­subcutaneous regions.
    Alternatively, the mid-peripheral temperature can be measured by placing a probe
    in the subcutaneous space or between tissue layers (Sellier et al., 2014). Although
    this technique has not been widely adopted commercially, because specialized skills
    are needed to insert the sensor, it has been used in experimental settings with
    some success (Abecia et al., 2015). Surface temperature is by far the easiest
    to measure and infrared technology has emerged as the primary approach for monitoring
    surface body temperature in livestock (Sellier et al., 2014). However, it suffers
    from interference in measurements due to environmental factors, such as wind velocity
    which can interfere with data collected by the thermal imaging cameras. Nevertheless,
    the use of thermal windows or areas of the body that are least affected by ambient
    temperature can overcome some of the impact of the environment on surface temperature
    monitoring of livestock (Poikalainen et al., 2012; Soerensen and Pedersen, 2015).
    Hence, measurements of the temperature of these areas are presently a focus of
    research using thermal tomography. One of the current obstacles to development
    is the workflow needed for the analysis of collected thermograms and analyze video
    or image feeds (Daltro et al., 2017). Furthermore, the surface temperature can
    capture micro-environment temperature instead of the real skin temperature, especially
    in animals with longer and/or denser hair coats. In addition to body temperature,
    rumen pH is another important biomarker that has been used to assess animal health
    and productivity due to the close relationship between rumen pH, microbial efficiency,
    and cow health (Krause and Oetzel, 2006; Dijkstra et al., 2012). Ruminal pH is
    monitored for early detection of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA), which is a
    common condition affecting early lactating dairy cattle (Duffield et al., 2004).
    The ECow bolus (Mottram et al., 2008), BioBolus (Kim et al., 2019), and Well Cow
    pH (Phillips et al., 2009) are examples of commercially available rumen pH sensors.
    Although these are selected for examples, numerous similar sensors have been developed
    (Duffield et al., 2004; Penner et al., 2006; Alzahal et al., 2007). A challenge
    with many indwelling rumen pH sensors is the short battery life, per-unit expense,
    measurement drift, and the inability to retrieve the device from cattle (Halachmi
    et al., 2019a). Recent works have investigated ultra-long life pH sensors with
    Ag/AgCI reference electrodes that have an estimated life of two years but are
    yet to be developed into commercial products (Higuchi et al., 2020). Another drawback
    of current commercially available products is the access to data and data ownership
    (Tedeschi et al., 2021). Most such products limit direct access to the data that
    impede precise data-driven decision-making by farmers. While a sustained drop
    in rumen pH is commonly associated with SARA there are potentially other indicators
    including rumen histamine that are linked to the onset of SARA. Histamine-producing
    bacteria are active in animals that experience SARA, resulting in an increase
    in the concentration of histamine in rumen fluid from 0.5 to 64 µM (Wang et al.,
    2013). Techniques for histamine analysis include thin-layer chromatography, high-performance
    liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, fluorometry, capillary zone electrophoresis,
    and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mattsson et al., 2017; Han et al., 2022).
    However, these techniques are not conductive to real-time sensing systems as they
    need specialized conditions and careful experimentation. Molecular imprinted polymer
    (MIP) and electrochemical histamine sensors show potential for histamine detection
    in ruminants due to their low-cost, simplicity of design, fast response, and high
    sensitivity. MIPs are synthetic receptors for a targeted molecule and are similar
    to the natural antibody-antigen systems (Horemans et al., 2012). MIP sensors are
    also robust and stable in extreme environments such as a wide range of pH environments.
    Recently, an impedimetric histamine biosensor based on an organic semiconductor:
    poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) has been
    developed that can detect concentrations of histamine from 0.1 to 1 mM (Bai et
    al., 2020). This sensor shows promise for adaptation to the in-rumen monitoring
    environment due to its robustness and ease of use (Bai et al., 2020). Such sensors
    can shed new light on rumen dynamics, thereby enriching our understanding and
    subsequent care for the animals. Physiology monitoring: body weight, body condition
    scoring, and lameness detection The physiology of the animal is affected in modern
    farming systems as they are restricted to small areas with hard ground, such as
    concrete. Such conditions can lead to debilitating diseases. Therefore, monitoring
    body weight and body condition is key to ensuring overall welfare for animals.
    The first step in this is tracking the body weight. Body weight measurement is
    also key from a productivity standpoint. The weight measurement of dairy cows
    is facilitated by a range of sensors and technologies. Traditional methods involving
    manual weighing can be labor-intensive and time-consuming (Martins et al., 2020;
    Kaya and Bardakcioglu, 2021). However, advancements in automated systems have
    revolutionized the process (Wang et al., 2021). Embedded in milking parlors or
    feeding stations, load cells provide real-time weight measurements as cows stand
    or walk on the platform (Martins et al., 2020). Walk-over weighing systems, integrated
    into walkways or feeding areas, allow for weight monitoring without disrupting
    the cow’s natural movement. Weighing gates in alleyways or passageways offer a
    convenient solution for measuring cow weights during movement. In these systems,
    electronic ear tags equipped with radio frequency identity (RFID) enable individual
    cow identification and weight estimation based on activity patterns (Kuzuhara
    et al., 2015). However, the limitations of several of these systems are related
    to the failure to measure the weight of all cows that pass through them (Halachmi
    et al., 2019b; Martins et al., 2020; Kaya and Bardakcioglu, 2021; Nilchuen et
    al., 2021). The failures can happen due to nonreading of the identification tag
    influenced by the speed at which the cows pass through the platform, or even the
    proximity of two cows. Additionally, small variations often cannot be accurately
    identified (Dickinson et al., 2013). Therefore, the need is for scalable low-cost
    solutions that can improve the precision as well as resolution of current systems.
    Body condition score (BCS) is a crucial measure for assessing cattle welfare and
    has significant implications for productivity, health, and reproductive success
    (Wildman et al., 1982; Rodriguez Alvarez et al., 2019). Accurate body condition
    scoring can help identify early signs of distress in cattle, and help prevent
    worsening of conditions such as lameness. In crowded modern farms, this is particularly
    challenging as for accurate scores the expert must have clear sight of the animal
    and its regular motion. Therefore, manual method of body scoring needs trained
    personnel, wherein significant time is required for evaluating the entire herd
    (Halachmi et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2019; Kaya and Bardakcioglu, 2021). Further,
    the subjective nature of the estimation varying greatly between evaluators and
    the inability to directly feed data into herd management software complicates
    the process more (Salau et al., 2014; Spoliansky et al., 2016). Consequently,
    there is a pressing need for objective and accurate BCS measurements. In recent
    years, the utilization of 2D and 3D sensors has gained traction in capturing cattle
    body parameters for BCS evaluation (Bercovich et al., 2013). Vision-based approaches
    have emerged as a nonintrusive method, involving visual feature extraction and
    model construction to estimate BCS (Lynn et al., 2017). While 2D camera-based
    methods focusing on rear or top views have been widely explored, 3D sensors, such
    as Time of Flight cameras, offer the advantage of capturing richer body surface
    information (Spoliansky et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). Machine learning techniques,
    including deep learning frameworks, have also been employed to improve BCS classification
    and prediction accuracy (Rodriguez Alvarez et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Martins
    et al., 2020). Despite the advancements in sensor technologies, challenges remain.
    An extended dataset with equitable distribution is essential to enhance system
    accuracy, and a more accurate BCS ground-truth apparatus is needed to eliminate
    subjective errors in scoring. Additionally, incorporating a broader range of body
    features and parameters, both global and local, is crucial to improving the robustness
    and accuracy of BCS evaluation. While 3D sensors offer detailed information, they
    are more expensive and complex than 2D tools, and the processing of 3D data and
    related algorithms poses additional challenges. Lameness is a debilitating disease
    that, if diagnosed late, can result in culling. Lameness management in dairy herds
    depends on the early diagnosis of the lame cow, determination of the causing agent,
    and effective treatment (Whay and Shearer, 2017). However, due to the stoic nature
    of the animal, large herd sizes, limited visibility, and easily missed markers,
    lameness detection is becoming increasingly tricky for human observers (Chapinal
    et al., 2010). Hence, automated detection of the lame cow by means of foot pressure
    sensors, cameras, and gait monitoring, is a potential solution that could result
    in early detection and treatment. Moreover, such technologies can also provide
    herd information thereby helping in the development of preventive strategies to
    minimize incidences of lameness, wherever possible. The identification of a lame
    cow by automated methods is, most of the time, based on the direct comparison
    of the cow’s gait to a normal/expected gait of a healthy cow (Kang et al., 2020).
    Image processing techniques assess the characteristics of the cow’s gait based
    on the movement of specific points on the feet, leg joints, withers, or backline,
    compared to the gait of the healthy cow. However, the true challenge for these
    methods is individualizing their assessment based on the cows’ physiology. To
    achieve this, they rely on creating massive datasets with expert annotations of
    gait (Zhao et al., 2018). Thirty-two experts in ruminant lameness were asked to
    weigh six aspects of gait when determining lameness in a survey. The results ranked
    each aspect as follows: general symmetry (24%), tracking (20%), spine curvature
    (19%), head bobbing (15%), speed (12%), and abduction and adduction (9%) of final
    gait score (Jones, 2017). These data suggest that even among experts, there is
    minimal agreement as to the most important indicators of lameness in cows. Due
    to this limited agreement among experts, sensors aiming to identify lameness using
    image analysis likely must be able to detect most of these aspects of gait abnormalities
    to be successful in the timely detection of lameness. Despite the diversity of
    biomechanical indicators of lameness, most of the published research has focused
    on spine arc and head bobbing (Zhao et al., 2018). Apart from image-based analysis,
    several other sensors using different sensing modalities have been tested to diagnose
    cow’s lameness: pressure-sensitive walkway (Maertens et al., 2011; Van Nuffel
    et al., 2015), accelerometers (Mangweth et al., 2012; Weigele et al., 2018), ground
    reaction force systems (Dunthorn et al., 2015; Thorup et al., 2015), four-scale
    weighing platform (Chapinal et al., 2010; Pastell et al., 2010), thermography
    (Alsaaod and Büscher, 2012), indirectly by the correlation with milk production
    (Kamphuis et al., 2013), feed intake and behavior (Weigele et al., 2018), and
    even the grooming behavior (Weigele et al., 2018). While many of these methods
    have achieved high accuracies of detection, they fail to be feasible for large-scale
    commercial deployment. Pressure sensors, ground reaction systems, and weighing
    scales are expensive to be deployed around the farm and demand individual analysis
    of the animal with an observer noting the difference. Further, thermography demands
    a specialized camera and setup which proves to be expensive. Milk quality sensing
    and mastitis detection Milk quality sensors are automated in-line sensors that
    check the milk collected to not only ensure the quality of the product but also
    check for the health biomarkers of the animal (Knight, 2020). Milk component sensors
    represent a key part of herd management technologies, allowing monitoring of cows’
    nutrition and metabolic abnormality detection of the cow (Mulligan et al., 2006;
    Aernouts et al., 2011; Melfsen et al., 2012). The majority of in-line milk composition
    analysis is currently carried out with in-line near-infrared (NIR) equipment (Melfsen
    et al., 2012) providing accurate data following international recommendations
    for reproducibility specified for in-line analytical devices. The prediction of
    the fat, protein, lactose, non-fat solids, and milk urea nitrogen using NIR spectra
    of non-homogenized milk during milking over a wavelength range of 700 to 1,050
    nm was assessed, and high levels of precision and accuracy were observed (Iweka
    et al., 2020). Although, it is important to note that to obtain high precision
    in the prediction of milk components the calibration model needs to be applied
    to different samples from different farms, and over different seasons. This is
    necessary due to the influence of the characteristics of the cows (such as age,
    number of lactations, lactation status, health, and reproductive status, diet,
    and seasonal effects) on the NIR spectra (Melfsen et al., 2013). The sensors used
    to diagnose mastitis include sensor of milk electrical conductivity (Norberg et
    al., 2004; Kamphuis et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2020), milk colorimetry
    (Hovinen et al., 2006; Kamphuis et al., 2010), milk lactate dehydrogenase concentrations
    by enzymatic reaction (Hovinen et al., 2006; Kamphuis et al., 2010), mammary gland
    temperature measured by thermography (Colak et al., 2008; Zaninelli et al., 2018)
    and real-time SCC assessment (Kamphuis et al., 2008). The information collected
    using the sensors can be used individually or in combination (which increases
    detection performance) to develop algorithms for mastitis prediction. The algorithm
    will be used to generate an alert of mastitis based on data collection. The early
    detection of mastitis is important in several ways. In the automated system because
    the visual identification of mastitis is not possible the detection by the sensor
    prevents the contamination of the farm milk changing the destination of the milk
    from the sick cow. Moreover, it allows the early treatment of the cow which will
    result in fewer days of treatment and milk waste and higher chances of full mammary
    gland recovery (Sargeant et al., 1998). Activity monitoring and virtual fencing
    Animal activity monitoring can provide key information not only about animal physiology
    and behavior but also about the farm environment. Changes in activity are highly
    indicative of estrus, especially for high-yielding (Rivera et al., 2010) and confined
    cows (Stevenson and Phatak, 2010). Increased activity in animals, in the absence
    of external factors, are potent indicators of estrus and positively correlated
    with the rate of pregnancy after artificial insemination (López-Gatius et al.,
    2005). Several automatic activity monitors are available and vary in their location
    in the animal’s body (e.g., neck and feet) and type of measured movement (e.g.,
    step counts, acceleration of movement, rumination time or frequency, lying time,
    or bouts). The collected data is analyzed to define baseline and outlier behavior
    which is further used for identifying estrus. Overall studies have reported satisfactory
    efficiency of sensors in estrus detection using neck-mounted sensors (Aungier
    et al., 2012; Valenza et al., 2012; Silper et al., 2015) or pedometers (Roelofs
    et al., 2005; Holman et al., 2011). Maintaining consistent environmental conditions
    is essential for dairy cows’ comfort, health, and productivity. Activity can be
    used to draw inferences about a cow’s environment (e.g., if cows are avoiding
    a specific area of the barn, it can be indicative of a higher temperature). Further,
    it is even more important for grazing cows as activity can be influenced by management
    practices or diurnal trends (Turner et al., 2000; Maroto-Molina et al., 2019).
    The global positioning system (GPS) is currently used for this objective with
    a precision of 5 to 30 m that can vary with the landscape characteristics, earth’s
    atmosphere, the sensitivity of the receiver clock, signal multipath, proximity
    of satellites, and satellites constellation (D’Eon et al., 2002). However, the
    technology is limited to animals managed outside of barns since the GPS has limited
    precision indoors. Indoor localization systems, based on triangulation of radio
    signals that continually assess the cow’s position through the association of
    the cow’s ID tag and sensor in the barn, can provide location as precise as 50
    cm (Tullo et al., 2016). Such precise monitoring can improve the identification
    of movements and further improve the prediction and detection of health events.
    Another aspect of animal activity monitoring is managing the activity within pasture
    fields. By managing the movement of cattle effectively, soil stress, overgrazing,
    and soil pollution can be avoided. PLF technology, especially virtual fencing,
    enables the manual herding and fencing methods to be easier and less effort intensive.
    Virtual fencing, an innovative approach in dairy cow management, offers an alternative
    to physical barriers by utilizing electronically defined boundaries (Umstatter,
    2011). Although they do not provide complete enclosure, these systems have gained
    significant attention in both research and commercial development. Examples of
    virtual fencing systems include BoviGuard, NoFence, and eShepherd (Umstatter,
    2011; Kaur et al., 2021). Virtual fencing greatly relies on the (GPS technology
    to operate in rural areas. Farmers can use GPS waypoints to select the boundaries
    of virtual fences and revise them as needed (Golinski et al., 2023). While GPS
    defines the boundary for the herd, each animal is tracked using an on-body device
    such as a neck collar (Anderson et al., 2014; Golinski et al., 2023). The neckband-mounted
    devices emit audible cues and electric stimuli that will guide cows and restrict
    their movement within a designated area. To familiarize cows with the virtual
    boundaries, these systems introduce visible and audible cues before applying electric
    stimuli. While individual cows may have varying learning curves, as a herd, they
    generally adapt to the virtual fencing system (Campbell et al., 2019). One key
    advantage of this method is its ability to direct dairy cows based on pasture
    availability instead of completely excluding them from specific areas (Anderson
    et al., 2014). However, it is crucial to recognize that physical fences remain
    necessary for security and property rights purposes. Yet, virtual fencing has
    been proven efficient in containing animals within determined grazing areas with
    adequate (Langworthy et al., 2021), as well as in situations with limited (Colusso
    et al., 2020) pasture availability. Nonetheless, widespread adoption of virtual
    fencing on commercial dairy farms faces challenges such as cost considerations,
    technological infrastructure limitations, and welfare concerns regarding individual
    animal behavior and public perception (Verdon et al., 2021; Golinski et al., 2023).
    Feed monitoring and precision feeding systems Feed intake and feeding behavior
    are critical aspects of precision feeding which is critical for individualized
    care for animals. Methods to collect feed intake data include stationary devices
    equipped with identification sensors (e.g., RFID) and feed weighing systems. Examples
    of RFID-based systems include GrowSafeG (GrowSafe Systems Ltd, Airdrie, AB, Canada),
    Calan gates (American Calan Inc., Northwood, NH), and Hokofarm feeding system
    (Hokofarm Group B.V., Veendam, the Netherlands). They are placed in feeding locations
    to monitor the frequency and duration of feeding. The amount ingested by the animal
    is determined by the difference in the weight of the feed before and after a feeding
    bout (Chizzotti et al., 2015). Several studies have been conducted to validate
    these systems (DeVries et al., 2003; DeVries and G., 2005; Belle et al., 2012).
    The collected data not only aids in tracking overall health and normal activity
    but also facilitates the early detection of diseases. Acoustics have been used
    to analyze jaw movement as an indicator of feeding behavior for cows. In addition,
    acoustics have been used to detect coughing and stress in swine (Vandermeulen
    et al., 2015) and cattle (Vandermeulen et al., 2016). Alternatively, machine vision
    has been employed to determine feed intake and monitor animal health (Bezen et
    al., 2020, 2022). While machine vision shows promise, its outcomes have yielded
    mixed results (Halachmi et al., 2019a), necessitating the development of more
    robust machine learning models before they can be considered as viable commercial
    options. Cows respond as individuals and have unique genetic merit for many production
    parameter variables including DMI, milk yield, milk fat percentage, milk fat yield,
    milk protein percentage, milk protein yield, milk lactose percentage, milk lactose
    yield, feed efficiency, and activity. However, cows are not managed individually
    to optimize these traits or maximize individual animal genetic potential. Individualized
    precision automated feeding systems (AFS) may help to increase the overall production
    of dairy cattle. However, precision feeding and traditional group feeding require
    very different feeding and management approaches. First, automation of feeding
    systems is necessary to feed cows individually on-farm and the use of different
    sensing systems coupled with different precision technologies is needed. The suitability
    of an AFS is dictated largely by the housing system. There are several housing
    styles of dairies, with single farms often incorporating multiple housing styles.
    Housing styles include individual housing (e.g., sick pens, tie stalls, etc.);
    indoor group housing (e.g., bedded pack, free stalls, etc.); and outdoor group
    housing (e.g., pasture, dry lots, etc.), among others (Bewley et al., 2017). Each
    of these housing styles differs in terms of its requirements for AFS. For example,
    in free-stall systems, an AFS must allow individualized feeding within a group
    pen. This requires the AFS to identify individual animals (typically based on
    RFID technology (Trevarthen and Michael, 2008; Singh and Mahajan, 2014), exclude
    access to the feeder to allow only the target individual to consume feed, dispense
    a target amount of feed, and clear any unconsumed feed. For AFS in outdoor settings,
    the system might additionally be required to resist extreme weather conditions
    and stand alone from other farm resources (e.g., grain hoppers, silos, etc.).
    The utilities of AFS are also defined by daily feed handling capacity and suitability
    for different feed types. In previous studies, AFS has been used to feed the concentrate
    component of the ration (Wierenga and Hopster, 1991) or to feed the entire ration
    (Belle and Andr, 2012). In most systems feeding only a portion of the total ration,
    the AFS is self-contained and includes a feed storage area. For AFS designed to
    feed the entire or majority of a ration, they are either connected to the existing
    farm feed storage and mixing infrastructure (e.g., stationary mixer, rail-mounted
    feed wagon, feed bunkers, silos, etc.) or require daily manual loading of a pre-mixed
    ration. The AFS that require manual loading of feed daily have higher labor requirements
    but are also more flexible in terms of the types of feed fed. For example, Oberschätzl-Kopp
    et al. (2016) used a rail-guided wagon-based, automated feeding system to feed
    group-housed animals and were able to feed a partially mixed ration through the
    system. Collectively, the housing system suitability, feed handling capacity,
    and type of feed dictate the number of cows fed per unit per day. Although this
    seems trivial, the number of units needed to feed a group of animals, the amount
    of feed fed through the units, and the resultant changes in productivity expected
    are the major drivers of whether the system will prove profitable. For example,
    with the adoption of robotic milking systems, we expect that the base price of
    labor and the expected annual inflation of labor costs will also have a major
    impact on whether adopting an AFS is a profitable decision (Pezzuolo et al., 2019).
    Because of the major differences in the possible applications of AFS and their
    net results in on-farm management and cow productivity, systems designed for feeding
    different types and amounts of feed should be considered separately because they
    have very different objectives. There are many types of automated feed delivery
    technologies, including rail-guided wagons, conveyor belts, and self-propelled
    robots (Grothmann et al., 2010). These different technologies can be used together
    within AFS to provide the most suitable combination of individual technology attributes
    to enhance system efficiency. For example, a robot could be used to load rail-guided
    wagons or conveyor belts. Similarly, a conveyor belt can be used to load wagons
    or a robotic feeder. Due to the individual nature of farm design and feeding system
    requirements, considering these technologies as possible parts of a larger AFS
    is likely the most appropriate. In addition to functioning to deliver feed, AFS
    can also be used to limit the amount of feed an animal can consume (Wierenga and
    Hopster, 1991) and can be designed to provide more frequent deliveries of feedstuffs
    than conventional, manual methods (Belle and Andr, 2012). These changes in feed
    delivery frequency and quantity can have benefits for farm profitability. In a
    survey carried out on 18 farms in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands
    in 2008, farms with AFS dispensed fresh feed 7.2 times a day, on average, and
    fed up to 10 different dietary components (Grothmann et al., 2010). Increasing
    the feeding frequency for dairy cattle is known to increase DMI, milk production,
    and milk components (Campbell and Merilan, 1961). Farm managers have reported
    that animals fed using AFS exhibit lower stress levels, attributed to the increased
    frequency of feedings. Additionally, submissive cows have been observed to consume
    a greater quantity of feed (Grothmann et al., 2010). Based on the survey results
    and other assessments of AFS, it is evident that when implemented correctly, AFS
    has the potential to provide individualized feeding for animals on commercial
    farms. This technology has the potential to enable more precise ration formulation,
    improve health and production, and reduce labor associated with feeding (Tangorra
    and Calcante, 2018). To make individualized precision feeding economically appealing
    for farmers, the value of an increase in cow productivity needs to exceed the
    costs of investment in technology (Pierpaoli et al., 2013). Maximum cow productivity
    from a nutritional management standpoint requires accurate, predicted requirements
    that are specific to each animal and its responses (Wang et al., 2000; Pierpaoli
    et al., 2013; White and Capper, 2014). Achieving this outcome will likely necessitate
    the utilization of automated sensing mechanisms to capture pertinent parameters
    associated with performance, with such algorithms seamlessly integrated into the
    analytics layer of precision animal farming systems. The actual feed intake of
    individual cows in commercial operations is frequently unknown, as sensors to
    record or estimate feed intake and individualized AFS capable of recording this
    information, are rarely implemented on commercial farms (Kamphuis et al., 2017).
    Van der Waaij et al. (2016) predicted individual cow intake utilizing a test data
    set driven by machine learning. Derivation data was used to train an artificial
    neural network that was based on biological neural networks efficient for use
    with high dimensional and nonlinear relationships (Van der Waaij et al., 2016).
    These networks are used as universal function approximators, but they require
    large datasets to train these parameters since no pre-assumptions are being made.
    The developed model was able to predict individual cow intake with a precision
    of 7.7% using concentrate feed allotted, milk yield, parity, weight, rumination,
    lactation day, fat percent, protein percent, outdoor temperature, and outdoor
    humidity (Van der Waaij et al., 2016). Precision feeding of dairy cattle through
    automated systems shows promise to increase feed efficiency and milk yield for
    individual animals while decreasing on-farm labor and feed expenses. However,
    the models needed to drive these systems have not yet been created and refined.
    Data on individual animal responses to dietary intervention are needed to develop
    and test appropriate models that best predict the nutrient requirements of individual
    animals and recommend the best diet composition and quantity for specific cows.
    Environmental monitoring and sensing The integration of sensor technology, sensor
    networks, remote sensing, and robotics can be implemented aiming to improve the
    welfare of dairy cows in the housing systems. The negative impacts of heat stress
    on dairy cows’ health and performance are well known. Heat stress can be assessed
    using a sensor that will measure physiological parameters like respiration rate
    (Atkins et al., 2018), heart rate (Munro et al., 2017), body temperature, and
    surface (Adams et al., 2013; Kou et al., 2017) and also, by environmental data
    such as temperature and humidity. Through the use of temperature and humidity
    sensors in the barns or by accessing this data from a meteorological station close
    to the farm, it is possible to calculate a temperature and humidity index and
    based on the limit of 68 (approximately 22 °C to 50% relative humidity), which
    indicates a reduction in milk production (Bouraoui et al., 2002), remotely activating
    barn’s strategies to reduce heat stress (sprinklers, fans, or both) (Chen and
    Chen, 2019). The association of environmental data with individual cows’ information
    such as concentrate intake, milk production, and composition can also be used
    to develop supervised machine learning to increase or maintain the desired level
    of milk quality while reducing heat stress (Fuentes et al., 2020). Environmental
    data can also be used for breeding for improved heat tolerance (Freitas et al.,
    2021). Gaseous ammonia is an important atmospheric component mainly produced in
    the cattle production system as a result of urea breakdown. The ammonia emission
    results in a loss of manure fertilizing value, and besides its effects on the
    environment (it readily reacts with acidic substances or sulfur dioxide to form
    ammonium salts and also can be converted into nitric oxide a greenhouse gas) is
    a potential respiratory hazard for workers and animal. The prolonged exposure
    to elevated concentrations of gaseous ammonia in dairy barns can result in eye
    and respiratory tract inflammation, however, because it is lighter than air it
    can be easily removed and well-ventilated barns. Sensors that can measure ammonia
    concentration in the air as described by (Banhazi, 2009), can help in the air
    management in dairy barns, especially during the winter when the barns are closed
    and with lower use of fans and for dairy calves that are more susceptible to respiratory
    issues caused by the ammonia (Osorio et al., 2009). Several management strategies
    can also be implemented to reduce the ammonia concentration and emission as ammonia
    concentration in the barn can vary due to air temperature, air humidity, air velocity,
    and air change rates (Herbut and Angrecka, 2014) and its emission due to air temperature
    and wind speed and direction (Saha et al., 2014; Schmithausen et al., 2018). Water
    quality monitoring Water is an important nutrient for all animals, and it is especially
    critical for dairy cows since 87% of the milk is constituted of water. The water
    requirement for a dairy cow to produce one liter of milk is 0.9 kg water (Murphy
    et al., 1983; National Research Council, 2001) being the total water requirement
    for an adult dairy cow is around 2.6 L of water per kg of milk produced. Water
    quality issues can manifest as health issues in dairy cows or, more often, as
    reduced water intake. Individual water intake can be accurately measured with
    water meters installed on lines to drinking devices when cows are individualized,
    taking measurements every couple of minutes (Cantor et al., 2018). Electronic
    systems that can monitor individual water intake by integrating RFID readers to
    load cells (Oliveira Jr et al., 2018) or level sensors (Tang et al., 2021) are
    also available allowing precisely individual data collection. Water temperature
    can also affect your water intake. Cows prefer warm water when given the choice
    even during the hottest months (Wilks et al., 1990). In addition, heating drinking
    water will increase water intake for cows regardless of the ambient temperature
    (Osborne et al., 2002). Therefore, systems that can control the water temperature
    in tanks or water troughs would be beneficial as a strategy for target groups,
    despite the economic aspect of that strategy (Osborne, 2006). Several physical-chemical
    parameters like water pH, mineral concentration, and bacterial contamination can
    influence the water intake and productivity of dairy cows (Schroeder, 2008). The
    total dissolved solids or salinity measure the amount of sodium chloride, bicarbonate,
    sulfate, calcium, magnesium, silica, iron, nitrate, strontium, potassium, carbonate,
    phosphorus, boron, and fluoride in water (NRC, 2001; NASEM, 2021). High mineral
    concentrations may limit animal performance (Solomon et al., 1995) and the cost
    associated with the water treatment most of the time makes its use unfeasible.
    Total dissolved solids above > 7,000 ppm are considered unacceptable for cows.
    The National Research Council (2001) recommends that the water fed to cattle should
    contain <5,000 ppm of total dissolved solids. Contamination of the water due to
    fertilizers, animal waste, fecal material, crop residue, or industrial waste can
    occur and result in acute poisoning. Nitrate is an important contaminant of water
    sources that is potentially harmful to ruminants due to increased sensitivity
    to nitrate toxicities when compared to monogastric. Nitrate in the rumen is reduced
    to nitrite that is absorbed into the bloodstream resulting in a reduction of the
    oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (Radostits et al., 2007). An electrochemical
    based nitrate sensor for the quantitative determination of nitrate concentrations
    in water (Gartia et al., 2012; Akhter et al., 2021) is available and can be used
    to monitor the water quality in dairy farms with a higher risk of water contamination.
    Despite advances in technology and the development of sensors to measure the quality
    parameters in water complex systems that allow monitoring water quality parameters,
    making decisions based on the collected data, and adapting more quickly to changing
    conditions at the dairy farm do not yet exist. Overall, the main problem plaguing
    the use of most sensors in dairy production is the need for high sampling rates.
    Battery life is a challenge for many sensor technologies. Moreover, farms usually
    cover large areas, animals are spread out and there are many interferences to
    signal detection. This creates challenges for data transmission (Sharma and Koundal,
    2018). Furthermore, modern technology like deep learning, machine vision, and
    machine learning is promising but the tools have not yet been developed robustly
    enough to permit practical utility in dairy production systems. Communication
    and networking in precision dairy farming Communication technology for precision
    animal agriculture Sensors present in and around the farm environment communicate
    data between themselves. This creates a farm network consisting of sensors on
    or inside the dairy animal’s body to other points in the farm. (Bandara et al.,
    2020). The data sharing between these sensors promotes deep data analytics which
    interprets the massive amount of information generated by the various sensors
    in the farm. In this section, we analyze the different communication technologies
    and the key parameters used in the designing of in-farm networks. In designing
    communication systems for sensor networks in a farm environment, the important
    parameters to be considered are transmission power, range of communication, bandwidth,
    energy efficiency, and data security. The constraints on these parameters are
    set based on the application and placement of sensor nodes present in the farm.
    For example, a size-constrained implantable device requires low power as well
    as high energy efficiency to increase the battery life which reduces the need
    for repeated invasive procedures on farm animals. On the other hand, the communication
    from a local hub to a cloud server may require more power-intensive methods and
    higher bandwidth to increase the data rate. Communication systems around a farm
    environment have traditionally used radio frequency (RF) based wireless communication
    methodologies. These communication paradigms operate at high frequency (100s of
    MHz to a few GHz) bands with energy efficiency ranging from hundreds of pico Joules
    per bits (pJ/bits) to well over tens of nJ/bits. High pJ/bit numbers result in
    increased energy consumption for communication. A high energy ­consumption for
    ­communication further leads to smaller battery lifetime. Therefore, implantable
    devices require high energy efficient communication methods (≤10 pJ/bits) which
    can lead to a longer device life. Thus, it is essential to ensure that communication
    power, which typically is orders of magnitude higher than computing power, should
    be optimized to ensure a higher device lifetime. Some popular RF-based communication
    protocols have been discussed here in terms of vital parameters for communication
    around the farm environment. Bluetooth (Tosi et al., 2017) based devices have
    been used extensively around farm environments for wireless health monitoring
    and tracking of animals. Bluetooth works at a frequency band of 2.4 GHz and devices
    operating on Bluetooth can work for a range of about 50 m. Bluetooth works effectively
    for mid-range (≤50 m) communication but is power hungry (~10 nJ/bit) thus affecting
    the battery life of the device. Bluetooth is especially useful for wearable sensors
    communicating to a common hub for data or to other wearable sensors and has been
    demonstrated in literature as a method for localization of dairy animals as well
    as communicating data from environment sensors to a cloud for further analytics
    (Rajagopal et al., 2014; Makario and Maina, 2021). ZigBee (Hidayat et al., 2020)
    is another short-range low-power communication protocol working for a range of
    up to 100 meters depending on the transmission power. ZigBee protocol also has
    been demonstrated with applications in monitoring environmental parameters in
    a farm setting. MedRadio spectrum has been used for communication to and from
    implantable nodes for the human body. Similar applications for in-farm systems
    can be in low-power data transmission between implantable nodes inside the rumen
    and a collar node on the body (Datta et al., 2023). MedRadio band has been defined
    by the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory body for monitoring and
    establishing protocols for electronic communication around the USA around the
    400 MHz range for devices worn around the body as well as implantable devices.
    The typical energy efficiency for MedRadio is an order of magnitude lower than
    Bluetooth can potentially increase device’s lifetime significantly. Long Range
    (LoRa; Sornin et al., 2015; Chiani and Elzanaty, 2019; Sokullu, 2022) protocol
    as the name suggests is a long-range communication technology. Communication between
    multiple on-body nodes or from one node to a data hub may require a larger communication
    range needing comparatively higher transmission power. This can be handled LoRa
    (Long Range) where the range of communication is of the order of a few kilometers.
    The data transfer between environmental parameter sensors or between wearable
    sensors to a common gateway at the center of the farm can be achieved effectively
    using LoRa as demonstrated previously in literature (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2020;
    Saban et al., 2022; Sokullu, 2022; Tooprakai et al., 2022). Communication from
    the gateways to a cloud server requires higher bandwidth and data rate. This is
    because the gateways may need to handle large amounts of data coming in from multiple
    on-body sensor nodes which are too close to it. The use of protocols like Wi-Fi
    will enable the gateway to pass a higher amount of data at a time to the cloud
    server with very low latency. For data transfer between implantable nodes (devices
    inside rumen) and an on-body node like a collar device, an alternative to the
    traditional RF-based methods is using the conductive properties of body tissues
    to transmit the signals at low frequencies of around 20 to 30 MHz or lesser (Fahier,
    2017; Datta, 2021a,b). Intra-body communication in the Electro-Quasistatics (EQS)
    domain enhances the energy efficiency of the system. This results in orders of
    magnitude improvement in the energy efficiency and power consumed when compared
    to popular RF-based methods such as Bluetooth and LoRa. This ensures a higher
    device lifetime which is essential in designing size-constrained implantable devices
    such that frequently complicated procedures to replace the devices which are uncomfortable
    for the animals are avoided. Further, intrabody communication also enhances data
    security. Implantable and wearable nodes deal with information that are sensitive
    and need to be protected from attackers. This data when in the wrong hands can
    lead to potentially serious consequences. The data from these implantable and
    wearable sensors thus needs to be secured. Physical layer security (Das et al.,
    2019) is a phenomenon where the signal is physically confined within a space such
    that it is unavailable to unintended receivers. This is observed in the for intrabody
    communication where the transmitted signal is confined within the body and signal
    leakage is only up to 5 to 10 cm away from the body. In comparison, RF methodologies
    like Bluetooth leak signals about 10 m away from the body. This means that the
    data that is being communicated using RF-based methods, is available to attackers
    with the required know how within a room scale area thus making the communication
    less secure. In case of Intrabody communication, this is mitigated as the signal
    is confined within the body. Thus, an efficient communication system for a farm
    environment will involve the use of multiple protocols dependent on the application.
    One such communication system architecture can be the use of broadband intrabody
    communication setup in EQS domain for on-body communication in conjunction with
    short-range narrowband communication methodologies like Bluetooth and ZigBee for
    information exchange around the herd. This along with long-range communication
    technologies like LoRa for communication with a central hub and has proved to
    be the most promising framework for wireless data transfer in a sensor network.
    The edge, the fog, and the cloud—building intelligence in the network Recent long
    range and low-power communication, as discussed previously, have enabled the integration
    of sensor networks into PLF for remote monitoring of animals. The integration
    of sensors with networking technology has led to the evolution of sensor nodes
    (Alli and Alam, 2020). In these networks, a node is an entity that generates data
    (edge), transforms or processes data (fog), or stores data (cloud). For example,
    on a dairy farm, the temperature sensor in the rumen of a cow serves as a source
    of data and also the farthest node, i.e., “the edge”, of the network from the
    central hub. The data from the sensor then reaches the collar of the cow, which
    is an intermediate node of the network. When such intermediate nodes have computation
    and analytics capabilities, such as identifying motion patterns, they become a
    “fog node” of the network. Finally, the data reaches the network gateway, which
    uploads it to a “cloud” storage. Accessing the data remotely and taking subsequent
    actions becomes possible due to the availability of remotely accessible cloud
    storage. This hierarchical arrangement of nodes facilitates enhanced functionalities,
    including faster data analysis at the sensor level, reduced network traffic by
    transmitting only relevant information to the cloud, and quicker response times
    during emergency conditions. The presence of low-power computers embedded in edge
    and fog nodes enables these nodes to make autonomous decisions. Large-scale networks
    supporting PLF can greatly benefit from distributed intelligence in the form of
    edge and fog computing (Jukan et al., 2019; Friha et al., 2021). For instance,
    in farms utilizing large-scale wireless sensor networks, substantial amounts of
    data are generated and transported. Fog and edge computing allow low-level devices
    to process and act on the data as it is generated, instead of waiting for the
    main datacenter to process and release commands. This decentralization of data
    processing and decision-making results in low-latency and efficient networks that
    require lower bandwidth (Tsipis et al., 2020). In situations where internet connectivity
    is intermittent, such as in farms, cloud-based data processing and decision-making
    are susceptible to interruptions and delays, leading to further delayed responses.
    Fog and edge computing make the network more self-reliant and robust to communication
    and connectivity issues. In recent years, numerous systems incorporating fog and
    edge computing infrastructure have been developed for animal health monitoring
    and management, both in academia and industry. Smart collars were used to predict
    heat stress in dairy cattle using an edge mining approach (Bhargava and Ivanov,
    2016). The smart collars estimated the probability of the onset of heat stress
    and alerted the farmer accordingly. The system was further enhanced by using interactive
    edge mining, where the collar detects the activity and uploads the information
    to the cloud only at the milking station (Bhargava et al., 2017). Herd health
    monitoring utilizing edge computing was achieved by connecting individual pedometers
    to a fog node located on the farm (Taneja et al., 2018). The fog node aggregated
    the data and performed pre-processing and classification to identify behavioral
    indicators of illness. The farmer was alerted in case signs of lameness were observed.
    While these systems used specialized edge devices, general-purpose computation
    boards such as Raspberry Pis and mobile phones are also being utilized as edge
    nodes for smart farming applications. Raspberry Pis are strong computing machines
    that can operate with low power and possess sufficient on-chip storage for edge-based
    processing and computing. They support open-source software which allows low-cost
    operation. Smartphones, equipped with precision sensors such as inertial measurement
    units, accelerometers, and GPS, are used not only for data collection and processing
    but also for interaction with users (Magaia et al., 2021). A study investigated
    the effectiveness of smartphones as an edge device for cattle monitoring found
    that smartphones (iPhone 4) reduced data redundancies by 43.5% (Magaia et al.,
    2021). Smart edge devices with machine learning capabilities are also being investigated
    for animal farming, especially dairy farming. The SmartHerd management system
    developed a microservices-based for-computing IoT platform for dairy farms that
    allows machine learning services to execute at the edge (Taneja et al., 2019).
    The platform reduced the total amount of data transmission by 83%. Similarly,
    a machine-learning-based system was proposed that identified behavioral patterns
    at the fog nodes for detecting lameness (Taneja et al., 2020). The system was
    able to detect lameness with an accuracy of 87% 3 d before visual signs appeared
    while reducing data transmission by 84%. Despite the clear advantages, the adaptation
    of edge and fog computing in animal farms has been limited, primarily due to cost
    and complexity considerations. The specialized edge devices provided by commercial
    sellers are expensive to implement for large farms, and they require regular updates
    or replacements within a few years; adding to the farmer’s expenses. Open-source
    systems, such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, can help in reducing costs, but their
    deployment often requires expertise that farmers may lack. However, as the benefits
    of such devices become more apparent in the long run and more farmers demand these
    services, the overall cost is expected to decrease. Moreover, the recent major
    investments in this sector will also contribute to increasing the penetration
    of such technologies, ensuring animal welfare in livestock farming. Analytics
    and artificial intelligence for precision dairy farming Nutrition models for animal
    health prediction Animal scientists leverage mathematical models of feed nutrient
    digestion and metabolism, as well as animal characteristics, to predict the nutrient
    requirements of livestock during various stages of production. These tools are
    then incorporated into a form of decision support system (ration formulation software)
    to help nutrition professionals precisely match the needs of the cow with the
    nutrient profiles provided by the diet. Mathematical models of ruminant nutrition
    have been widely reviewed (Tedeschi et al., 2005; Mulligan et al., 2006; Cannas
    et al., 2019; Tedeschi, 2019, 2022). In brief, traditional animal nutrition models
    (Fox et al., 2004) focus on mechanistic understanding of biology in an attempt
    to better replicate animal responses to combinations of nutrients. Concurrent
    to the expansion of these models, artificial intelligence and machine learning
    have developed as powerful tools to support the extraction of understanding from
    data. Although some researchers highlight tremendous opportunities to leverage
    machine learning to support the advancement of animal nutrition (Neethirajan,
    2020), others point out that the data-heavy nature of these approaches and the
    movement away from mechanistic and systems-thinking may exacerbate limitations
    of modeling tools available to support ruminant nutrition (Tedeschi, 2019) Agnostic
    of modeling approach, advancement of nutrition models can be advocated toward
    a variety of purposes. At the descriptive and predictive levels, some elements
    of animal physiology are data-poor, often due to animal ethical considerations
    and cost limitations associated with data generation. In these situations, there
    is value in exploring a variety of alterative data analytics (systems dynamics
    modeling [Tedeschi et al., 2011; Walters et al., 2016] or networking [Sujani et
    al., 2023], among others) in conjunction with more traditional statistical or
    mechanistic modeling approaches to make more thorough use of the available data.
    Alternatively, in these settings, digital twins (Raba et al., 2022) and data modeling
    (Neethirajan and Kemp, 2021; Menendez et al., 2022) may be viable alternatives
    to address the low data availability; however, such tools are limited if not informed
    by a sufficiently representative dataset. Animal nutrition data also present challenges
    for more desirable prescriptive analytics. Although some promise has been shown
    in developing prescriptive tools to support animal feeding choices (Siberski-Cooper
    et al., 2023), and in efforts to influence feed intake of individuals (Souza et
    al., 2022). Advancement of efforts to develop more prescriptive analytics to support
    animal feeding may require further data collection leveraging IoT systems. Traditional
    animal nutrition data is collected on groups, whereas desirable feeding choices
    would be made on an individual basis. Further ­traditionally, data has been collected
    after long adaptation times rather than in response to short-term diet shifts.
    At a minimum, these mismatches of available data should be evaluated to define
    their importance in supporting or limiting progress toward the goal of defining
    predictive analytics to support profitable, automated feeding. Predictive analytics
    for animal health As described above, mechanistic models are developed based on
    the understanding of the biological mechanism of the animal. The whole animal
    system is divided into many subsystems, and the reactions of individual subsystems
    and relationships between these subsystems are described by prior biological knowledge.
    In particular, Molly is a dynamic model that predicts the cow’s outputs (e.g.,
    dry matter intake, daily milk production, etc.) over a period based on the user’s
    input of initial conditions of the cow (e.g., body weight, body fat percent, etc.)
    and nutrition information of the diets (Baldwin, 1995). It has been used extensively
    and has undergone multiple updates (Hanigan et al., 2006; Gregorini et al., 2015;
    Li et al., 2019b; Rius et al., 2019; Li and Hanigan, 2020). For example, the 1995
    Molly model is developed based on a nutrient-based input scheme, i.e., each nutrient
    is treated as a homogeneous substrate regardless of the source of that nutrient
    (Hanigan et al., 2006). The work (Hanigan et al., 2006) modified the 1995 Molly
    model by including ingredient-based inputs as well as accommodating input changes
    within a run. The work (Rius et al., 2019) adjusted the original model and altered
    the prediction in milk production in response to changes in milking frequency.
    Compared to the old Molly model, the newest model has more accurate predictions
    in various aspects by incorporating new understandings of biological responses.
    Parameter estimation is conducted by using real data. These mechanistic models
    are usually robust in their predictions. However, they are usually unable to capture
    the variations of individual cows due to factors like genetic potential. Furthermore,
    a comprehensive comparison of different models is usually hard to make due to
    the requirements of unique inputs of different models (Tedeschi et al., 2014).
    There is no clear criterion of the “best” model that the user can always choose.
    Due to their ability to capture the dynamics of cattle digestive systems, mechanistic
    models such as Molly provide a significant opportunity for rigorous control-theoretic
    approaches to precision animal agriculture. For example, the paper (Gregorini
    et al., 2013) describes a mechanistic and dynamic model of the diurnal grazing
    pattern of a dairy cow, which is developed based on a cluster of three existing
    models, including Molly. The paper (Romera et al., 2012) presents a framework
    that makes use of a whole farm model and a mechanistic soil model. The author
    argued that this scheme makes the most of the information generated by the whole
    farm model, and hence can concurrently capture the variability among New Zealand
    dairy farm systems, and predict nitrogen leaching by using a detailed soil model.
    A specific opportunity for the use of predictive models coupled with control theoretic
    and machine learning techniques is in choosing optimal diet formulations for cattle,
    as feed represents approximately 70% of total operating costs (Li and Hanigan,
    2020). The least cost problem using static models (e.g., the NRC model [National
    Research Council, 2001]) has been studied by (St-Pierre and Thraen, 1999). The
    optimization of a dynamical system is in general considered harder than the static
    case. The work (Boston and Hanigan, 2005) discusses the optimization problem of
    dairy cow ration formulation using the Molly model. The code is configured in
    such a way that one can deal with user-defined objectives, e.g., maximize the
    production return and minimize the costs subject to some constraints. There are
    many examples of deploying machine learning techniques in agriculture. For example,
    the work (Li et al., 2019a) uses artificial neural networks to predict a variety
    of outputs in the rumen. The work (Jiang et al., 2019) presents a method based
    on a double normal distribution statistical model to detect the lameness of dairy
    cows. The work (Ebrahimi et al., 2019) compares the performances of different
    machine learning models for the detection of sub-clinical bovine mastitis. The
    work (Hempel et al., 2020) does a comprehensive study of different supervised
    machine learning models for predicting methane emissions from a naturally ventilated
    cattle building in Northern Germany. A key challenge of training highly nonlinear
    machine learning models is that the data has to be very clean, and this could
    be resolved by using better sensors. However, it is worth noting that the data
    obtained from sensors still need to be standardized, especially across data collection
    platforms, and validated. Developing comprehensive metadata files is paramount
    for enabling the integration and full usage of the datasets generated. In addition,
    it may be of importance to develop individualized models for cows to capture their
    individual variations. This may be challenging using a fully empirical approach
    considering the lifespan of a cow and the amount of data we need to train an individualized
    model. It is hence interesting to develop an individualized animal model by combining
    both empirical and mechanistic approaches more closely (grey box model). Tedeschi
    (2022) provides important insights in this area of data analytics to support sustainable
    developments in animal science. Over the past decades, various models and approaches
    for predicting animal health have been proposed. The efficiency of the models
    depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the variables used in the predictions
    and can incorporate indicators of animal behavior, physiological status, activity
    level, genomic information of individual animals, variability in performance indicators,
    and many others. The area of epidemiology modeling has advanced substantially,
    and sophisticated models have been proposed. For instance, Gutierrez-Jara et al.
    (2019) proposed a mathematical model to evaluate the dynamics of infectious diseases
    with two susceptibility conditions, in which the model assumes individuals infected
    by one disease are more susceptible to another disease and when they recover from
    a disease, they acquire partial immunity. Many models proposed for humans can
    also be adapted to livestock species. For instance, Appuhamy et al. (2013) proposed
    mathematical models for predicting diabetes prevalence based on incidence rates
    estimated considering birth, death, migration, aging, diabetes incidence dynamics,
    and body mass index. Use of PLF data for precision breeding through genomic selection
    As previously discussed, a large amount of information has been generated by electro-optical,
    acoustical, mechanical, and (bio)sensor technologies and is being used for more
    ­accurate decisions based on quantitative and qualitative analytic results (Nayeri
    et al., 2019). In this context, the US is home to the largest precision dairy
    farms in the world and large dairy breeding companies, which are equipped with
    high-throughput phenotyping technologies and whole-genome genotyping of thousands
    to millions of animals, which can be used for deriving novel traits for selection
    purposes (Chen et al., 2023; Pedrosa et al., 2023). The PLF used include AMS (milking
    robots); animal-based sensors (e.g., ear tags, collars, or bands containing devices
    that sense activity [pedometers and accelerometers] and/or location [GPS or radio-based
    proximity]); environment-based sensors that can include RFID detectors, microphones
    (to capture vocalization, for instance), and various camera technologies including
    monochromatic, color, 3D, infra-red and thermal; automated calf feeders; and automatic
    body weight recording (Brito et al., 2020); (Fang et al., 2017; Morota et al.,
    2018; Halachmi et al., 2019a). A vast amount of data is generated by these technologies,
    but it is currently underutilized (Koltes et al., 2019; Wurtz et al., 2019), especially
    for breeding purposes. The use of a large amount of PLF data can contribute to
    a more accurate prediction of the genetic merit of young animals for a wide range
    of relevant traits, and thus, enable the optimal selection of breeding candidates,
    which will be the parents of the next generation as reviewed by (Brito et al.,
    2020). Precision technologies provide an opportunity to assess physiological,
    behavioral, health, and production variables, which can be combined to indicate
    the overall welfare status of individual animals (Brito et al., 2020; Buller et
    al., 2020; Niloofar et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2021). As reviewed by Brito et
    al. (2020), this is crucial because the ideal welfare assessment indicators should
    be as objective as possible, robust (can be applied under a wide range of on-
    and off-farm situations), relevant and valid (reveal aspects of the animal’s affective
    or physiological state that is important to their welfare), reliable (can be repeated
    with confidence in the results), cost-effective, and well accepted by all industry’s
    stakeholders (Fleming et al., 2016). The majority of welfare and behavior indicators
    have been shown to be heritable and, therefore, can be improved through genetic
    selection (Morota et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2018; Fernandes et al., 2019; Brito
    et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020). Genomics combined with PLF data holds significant
    promise for improving animal welfare, as it permits increasing the accuracy of
    breeding values for selection candidates or close relatives, even if they are
    not exposed to additional stressors. This creates an opportunity to measure a
    large number of traits (deep phenotyping) in the same group of animals and use
    this information to genetically select nonphenotyped animals in commercial farms.
    Currently, a limited number of livestock breeding programs have included welfare
    indicator traits in their selection schemes (Miglior et al., 2017; Turner et al.,
    2018; Chang et al., 2020). However, this is expected to change as more farms start
    to implement precision technologies and integrate all the data generated. Considering
    the multidimensional nature of the datasets collected and multitude of variables,
    machine learning will likely be the best approach to process and integrate all
    these variables when multiple sources of information are available. Economic evaluation
    of digital technologies The growing demand for precision agricultural tools has
    not been matched by rapid adoption and broad use by farms. The lack of adoption
    of precision practices and technologies by farmers may be related to the uncertainties
    regarding the investment payoff (Russell and Bewley, 2013; Borchers and Bewley,
    2015). {Borchers, 2015, An assessment of producer precision dairy farming technology
    use`, prepurchase considerations`, and usefulness}However, it is necessary to
    carry out a complete assessment that proves, in the field, the value of precision
    agriculture technologies and, ultimately, proves reliable from the farmer’s point
    of view. The development of a complete precision farm system consists of 1) technologies,
    2) data analysis, 3) integration of information, and 4) decision-making. The collection
    of data without the interpretation and the generation of an alert to the farm
    manager provides little or no value and technologies that lack this integration
    are destined to fail in the marketplace. Likewise, technologies that have not
    been proven in a commercial setting are of concern and may not deliver the intended
    outcomes. Technologies that integrate all elements of the system with appropriate
    management action or standard operating procedures to enable an economic return
    on the investment. Benefits in this regard can be related to a reduction in disease
    incidence and severity, improving productive efficiency, reduced labor, enhanced
    animal and operator wellbeing, reduced environmental impacts of production, or
    several combinations of these attributes (Banhazi et al., 2012; Makinde et al.,
    2022). For example, in evaluating the implementation of inline milk progesterone
    sensors in place visual estrus detection observed a break-even price range between
    4 and 106 US$ per cow-year depending on differences in implementation type and
    herd reproduction management (Østergaard et al., 2005). The economic return is
    related in this situation to the reduction in the labor cost and also an increase
    in estrus detection and therefore is likely to be farm and location-specific.
    For example, southwest regions of Ireland invest more in technologies for calf
    management and milking, whereas the northwest region invested in reproduction
    management (Palma-Molina et al., 2023). However, communicating the benefits of
    such technology to farmers is key. A great example of this AMS adoption in Canada.
    Massive infrastructure and technology costs were incurred in implementing AMS
    on commercial farms, yet the promise of scalability and the confidence in the
    technology helped get the initial buy-in from farmers to invest between $1.2 million
    and $3.2 million in the technology (Makinde et al., 2022). In a recent survey,
    80% of the farmers believed that PLF technology can improve animal health and
    welfare, and 53.3% believed that it can reduce labor costs (Makinde et al., 2022).
    Overall, the sentiment towards including technology in daily operation is more
    positive, as most farmers have experienced positive return on investment even
    from primitive tools. For dairy cattle, especially in feedlots, the improvement
    in weight scales in terms of ease of use and accuracy has been especially useful.
    Notably, the major barrier to adopting PLF systems in dairy farms is not just
    the cost of the technology itself, but the cost of maintenance and the cost of
    skilled labor needed to operate it. However, specialists believe that as technology
    becomes easier to use, such barriers will reduce and the full potential of PLF
    will be realized on farms. Limitations in the adoption of sensors and precision
    technologies on dairy farms Many factors limiting dissemination and adaptation
    of sensor and digital technologies for dairy production have been highlighted
    previously (Bewley and Russell, 2010; Empel et al., 2016) including, the level
    of management needed to implement the technology, risk associated with the technology,
    facility constraints, overall producer goals and motivations, and level of interest
    in a specific technology. These factors are influenced by the producer’s age,
    level of formal education, learning style, producer goals, farm size, business
    complexity, perceptions of risk, type of production system, level of innovativeness,
    and use of the technology by peers and other family members (Bewley and Russell,
    2010). The potential value of the sensor and digital technologies in PLF is also
    tempered in some cases by the insufficient robustness of sensors (Wathes et al.,
    2008), incompatibility of data received from different sensors, connectedness
    among data sensor platforms, and ease of transformation of sensor data into actionable
    information (Van Hertem et al., 2016). The lack of “ground trothing” and appearance
    in the market without rigorous testing also results in negative experiences which,
    in some cases, has stalled the uptake and further development of precision agriculture
    technologies (Eastwood and Renwick, 2020). The development of new technologies
    has occurred at a faster rate than adoption by farms, which generates even more
    uncertainties in the producer and the desire to wait for further improvements
    before adoption (Borchers and Bewley, 2015). The information generated by unbiased
    research needs to be transmitted to farmers reliably and transparently for difficulties
    in implementing the technology will be overcome. Summary and conclusions Digital
    technologies, including sensors, communication networks, and decision support
    systems, have the potential to revolutionize dairy production for sustainable
    intensification and meet the growing demand for animal proteins. By collecting
    data on individual cows’ health, production, and activity, these technologies
    enable better management decisions, allowing fewer skilled individuals to care
    for more cows while maintaining animal welfare. Integration of sensors and systems
    for individual feed intake monitoring is crucial for effective and autonomous
    cow management at scale. While technologies today have shown potential, more customized
    and collectively integrated solutions are needed for broader adoption in the community.
    Efforts should focus on developing cost-effective and interoperable sensors across
    different farm sizes. Robust communication networks are vital for sensor systems
    in commercial farms to aggregate data effectively. Smart animal agriculture utilizes
    sensors attached to animals to improve welfare and productivity. Energy-efficient
    and low-power communication, such as EQS Body Channel Communication, can enhance
    data transmission from sensors inside animals, enabling smart animal agriculture.
    Combining mechanistic models and machine learning techniques can enhance decision-making
    in animal agriculture. Advanced models can provide accurate predictions for better
    management strategies, including optimal diet formulation and early disease detection.
    The successful integration of relevant sensors, robust communication networks,
    and accurate prediction models can transform animal agriculture, ensuring sustainability
    and productivity while prioritizing animal well-being. Abbreviations:  AFS automated

  description: Phytopathology is a highly complex scientific discipline. Initially,
    its focus was on the study of plant–pathogen interactions in agricultural and
    forestry production systems. Host–pathogen interactions in natural plant communities
    were generally overlooked until the 1970s when plant pathologists and evolutionary
    biologists started to take an interest in these interactions, and their dynamics
    in natural plant populations, communities, and ecosystems. This article introduces
    the general principles of plant pathosystems, provides a basic critical overview
    of current knowledge of host–pathogen interactions in natural plant pathosystems,
    and shows how this knowledge is important for future developments in plant pathology
    especially as it applies in cropping systems, ecology, and evolutionary biology.
    Plant pathosystems can be further divided according to the structure and origin
    of control, as autonomous (wild plant pathosystems, WPPs) or deterministic (crop
    plant pathosystems, CPPs). WPPs are characterized by the disease triangle and
    closed-loop (feedback) controls, and CPPs are characterized by the disease tetrahedron
    and open-loop (non-feedback) controls. Basic general, ecological, genetic, and
    population structural and functional differences between WPPs and CPPs are described.
    It is evident that we lack a focus on long-term observations and research of diseases
    and their dynamics in natural plant populations, metapopulations, communities,
    ecosystems, and biomes, as well as their direct or indirect relationships to CPPs.
    Differences and connections between WPPs and CPPs, and why, and how, these are
    important for agriculture varies. WPP and CPP may be linked by strong biological
    interactions, especially where the pathogen is in common. This is demonstrated
    through a case study of lettuce (Lactuca spp., L. serriola and L. sativa) and
    lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae). In other cases where there is no such
    direct biological linkage, the study of WPPs can provide a deeper understanding
    of how ecology and genetics interacts to drive disease through time. These studies
    provide insights into ways in which farming practices may be changed to limit
    disease development. Research on interactions between pathosystems, the “cross-talk”
    of WPPs and CPPs, is still very limited and, as shown in interactions between
    wild and cultivated Lactuca spp.–B. lactucae associations, can be highly complex.
    The implications and applications of this knowledge in plant breeding, crop management,
    and disease control measures are considered. This review concludes with a discussion
    of theoretical, general and specific aspects, challenges and limits of future
    WPP research, and application of their results in agriculture.

  explanation: This study provides new insights into the complexities of interactions
    between domesticated and wild plant pathosystems, with implications for agricultural
    disease control. It highlights the potential for cross-talk between these systems,
    the movement of pathogens between them, and the role of nonhost resistance in
    disease management. These findings emphasize the value of studying wild plant
    pathosystems to better understand and control crop diseases.
  extract_1: From recent field studies in the Czech Republic, it is evident that the
    most common weedy host species of B. lactucae is L. serriola (Lebeda et al. 2008a),
    but the epidemiological impact of B. lactucae on wild Lactuca spp. is not well
    known. Quantitative results in the same region showed that lettuce downy mildew
    on L. serriola was both temporally and spatially rather common and infected approximately
    75 to 80% of the natural host populations. However, the degree of incidence and
    prevalence of symptom expression on infected plants and their populations was
    rather low (Fig. 2). No boom-and-bust cycle was recorded and a long-lasting dynamic
    equilibrium between host and pathogen populations is expected (Lebeda et al. 2008a;
    Mieslerová et al. 2013). Nevertheless, enormous variation and heterogeneity was
    found in the expression of macroscopic symptom response on naturally infected
    leaves of L. serriola (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda et al. 2008a). This probably reflects
    differences in the genetic background of the resistance in individual plants and
    their populations, as well as responses to differences in the local environment
    (Lebeda et al. 2008a).
  extract_2: The occurrence of B. lactucae isolates in both pathosystems with combined
    v-phenotype structures supports the potentiality of gene flow between the pathosystems.
    (Lebeda and Petrželová 2004; Petrželová and Lebeda 2004; Petrželová et al. 2013).
    The short distances between these pathosystems (Lebeda et al. 2008a) also favors
    the possibility of gene flow.

    ABSTRACT PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Phytopathology is a highly complex scientific
    discipline. Initially, its focus was on the study of plant–pathogen interactions
    in agricultural and forestry production systems. Host–pathogen interactions in
    natural plant communities were generally overlooked until the 1970s when plant
    pathologists and evolutionary biologists started to take an interest in these
    interactions, and their dynamics in natural plant populations, communities, and
    ecosystems. This article introduces the general principles of plant pathosystems,
    provides a basic critical overview of current knowledge of host–pathogen interactions
    in natural plant pathosystems, and shows how this knowledge is important for future
    developments in plant pathology especially as it applies in cropping systems,
    ecology, and evolutionary biology. Plant pathosystems can be further divided according
    to the structure and origin of control, as autonomous (wild plant pathosystems,
    WPPs) or deterministic (crop plant pathosystems, CPPs). WPPs are characterized
    by the disease triangle and closed-loop (feedback) controls, and CPPs are characterized
    by the disease tetrahedron and open-loop (non-feedback) controls. Basic general,
    ecological, genetic, and population structural and functional differences between
    WPPs and CPPs are described. It is evident that we lack a focus on long-term observations
    and research of diseases and their dynamics in natural plant populations, metapopulations,
    communities, ecosystems, and biomes, as well as their direct or indirect relationships
    to CPPs. Differences and connections between WPPs and CPPs, and why, and how,
    these are important for agriculture varies. WPP and CPP may be linked by strong
    biological interactions, especially where the pathogen is in common. This is demonstrated
    through a case study of lettuce (Lactuca spp., L. serriola and L. sativa) and
    lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae). In other cases where there is no such
    direct biological linkage, the study of WPPs can provide a deeper understanding
    of how ecology and genetics interacts to drive disease through time. These studies
    provide insights into ways in which farming practices may be changed to limit
    disease development. Research on interactions between pathosystems, the “cross-talk”
    of WPPs and CPPs, is still very limited and, as shown in interactions between
    wild and cultivated Lactuca spp.–B. lactucae associations, can be highly complex.
    The implications and applications of this knowledge in plant breeding, crop management,
    and disease control measures are considered. This review concludes with a discussion
    of theoretical, general and specific aspects, challenges and limits of future
    WPP research, and application of their results in agriculture. Vegetation around
    the globe is distributed in various biomes (large scale ecosystems) (Allaby 2006a,
    2006b; Bailey 1998) and biogeography areas (Cox et al. 2016; Lomolino 2020). However,
    our knowledge of these biomes and geographic areas from the viewpoint of pathogens
    and pests is very different. We have extensive knowledge regarding diseases of
    temperate agriculture (Lucas 2020; Tronsmo et al. 2020), reasonably complete basic
    knowledge about diseases of temperate forests and tropical agricultural crops
    (Holliday 1995; Kranz et al. 1977), but a full accounting of tropical forest diseases
    is nowhere near complete. It is evident that the discipline of pathogeography
    (Reichert 1953) or geophytopathology, the study of the geographic distribution
    of pathogens and pests (Weltzien 1978), is poorly developed. Pathogens and pests
    are an integral part of every natural ecosystem (Burdon 1987a; Burdon and Leather
    1990; Thresh 1981), agroecosystem (Carroll et al. 1990), and individual plant
    communities (Harper 1977). They represent an important factor in shaping the structure
    and function of ecosystems (Burdon and Laine 2019). However, our understanding
    of these processes is limited, due in part to lack of a strong integration of
    plant ecology and plant pathology. Indeed, in contrast to their often extensive
    treatment of animal host–parasite interactions including human diseases (Krebs
    2001; Rockwood 2015; Townsend et al. 2008; Vandermeer and Goldberg 2013), until
    recently, population biology, ecology, or vegetation ecology textbooks have given
    little consideration to the ecological or evolutionary dynamics of plant–pathogen
    associations (Collinge and Ray 2006; Gurevitch et al. 2002; Keddy 2017; Krebs
    2001; Milgroom 2015; Rockwood 2015; Schulze et al. 2005; Silverton and Charlesworth
    2001; Townsend et al. 2008; van der Maarel and Franklin 2013; Vandermeer and Goldberg
    2013). Plant Pathosystems—Their Structure and Characteristics A system can be
    described as many patterns of patterns that are interrelated so as to constitute
    a single overall pattern. Here we take a plant pathosystem to represent any subsystem
    of an ecosystem (Pickett and Cadenasso 2002) that involves parasitism and pathogenesis
    of plants. A plant pathosystem is defined as a system of one or more host species
    and a parasite (or pathogens and whole microbiome) species influencing each other
    at several levels and affecting each other''s population dynamics, genetics, and
    evolution at the community level (Robinson 1976; Zadoks and Schein 1979). For
    convenience, plant pathosystems can be broadly divided into two groupings reflecting
    the degree of human intervention—natural (wild plant pathosystem [WPP]) and artificial
    (crop plant pathosystem [CPP], human-managed systems)—and the term may be applied
    at any systems level (e.g., the individual, population, community, ecosystem,
    and geographic range). A multiple pathosystem is a pathosystem where one host
    species is affected by two or more pathogens, or multiple hosts are affected by
    multiple pathogens with overlapping host ranges, which may interact and attenuate
    or exacerbate damage to the host (Zadoks 2005). Analysis of pathosystems can be
    defined as the study of pathosystem structure and behavior at all system levels.
    Pathosystems analysis studies pathosystem structure with the aim of generating
    a better understanding of pathosystem behavior (Robinson 1976, 1979). Within the
    pathosystem, host–pathogen interactions are governed by the laws applicable to
    different systems levels, e.g., on a population level, it is population genetics
    and population dynamics (Zadoks 1971; Zadoks and Schein 1979). Pathosystems must
    be considered as dynamic and open systems, however, with various levels of complexity,
    stability, and autonomy (Table 1). TABLE 1 Structural and functional differences
    between natural ecosystems (wild plant pathosystems) and agroecosystems (crop
    plant pathosystems) (modified according to Gliessman 1998; Mayr 1970; Odum 1997;
    Robinson 1976; Zadoks and Schein 1979) View as HTML WPPs Strictly considered,
    WPP are autonomous systems outside the direct control of humans (Table 1). Control
    in these systems is primarily due to communication between the three basic components:
    the host, the pathogen, and the environment (disease triangle), as an equilateral
    system, where each side contributes to disease development. This was called “the
    equivalence theorem” (Van der Plank 1963). Probably the most crucial characteristic
    of WPPs is their long-term stability, i.e., the balance between host plant species
    and their pathogens. This hypothetical balance or homeostasis between host and
    pathogen (Zadoks 2005) is probably based on dynamic polymorphisms (Leimar 2005)
    and/or dynamic equilibrium (Zadoks 2005). From a spatiotemporal viewpoint, pathogens
    and host plants have co-evolved for sufficiently long periods in specific ecosystems
    to generate a dynamic stability. This stability is based on a combination of diverse
    variability mechanisms (Alexander 2010; Burdon and Laine 2019) coupled with a
    range of simple ecological processes such as seed banks, age structured populations,
    and variable numbers of infection cycles (Brown and Tellier 2011; Tellier and
    Brown 2009) that interact to maintain both plants and pathogens in dynamic equilibrium.
    It means that such pathosystems are less affected by highly destructive disease
    epidemics (Alexander 2010; Kranz 2003) than crop plant pathosystems (CCPs) in
    which severe crop losses to disease occur (Agrios 2005). However, more detailed
    knowledge of these homeostatic mechanisms could provide a better understanding
    of why some wild pathogens are consistently uncommon over space and time while
    others show epidemic behavior on a more regular basis. In this regard, instances
    of exotic diseases moving into previously unchallenged host populations (e.g.,
    Cronartium ribicola on five-needled pines, Geils et al. 2010; Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus
    on Fraxinus excelsior, Needham et al. 2016) or the release of fungi for the biological
    control of invasive weed species (e.g., Puccinia chondrillina on Chondrilla juncea,
    Cullen et al. 1973; Burdon et al. 1981; Entyloma ageratinae on Ageratina riparia,
    Barton et al. 2007) give some insight into the functioning of homeostatic mechanisms
    (Burdon et al. 2013). During the last two decades, there has been increasing interest
    in understanding the variability and coevolutionary consequences of interactions
    in WPP (summarized in Alexander 2010; Burdon and Laine 2019; Lebeda and Burdon
    2013a, b; Lebeda et al. 2014a; Simms 1996) as a basic key for the potential management
    of plant−pathogen interactions in agricultural and forestry settings. Originally,
    all plant pathosystems were wild and either unaffected by hunter-gatherer societies
    or subject to the spatially highly focused impact of slash and burn strategies.
    However, as human populations grew and became urbanized, a shift to settled food
    production and the selection and cultivation of specific food plants, beginning
    in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent ca 9,500 years B.C.E. (Gepts et al.
    2012; Zohary and Hopf 1993), saw the step-by-step expansion of CPPs that now cover
    ∼40% of the terrestrial surface of the planet with dominating influence of humans.
    Finally, WPPs can logically be divided into those in which there is the potential
    for an immediate biological interplay with one or more CPPs, and those in which
    no such linkage exists. This difference has the potential to fuel profound differences
    in the ways in which WPPs contribute to agricultural production. Where a pathogen
    is common to both the WPP and CPP there is an immediate potential for the wild
    system to have a direct negative effect by acting as a pathogen refuge during
    the off-season and a source of inoculum early in the crop''s development. In addition,
    if the wild host species is sufficiently closely related to the crop, it may prove
    to be of great value as a source of novel resistance genes and alleles for use
    by plant breeders—one of the major rationales for germplasm bank collections.
    The interactions of wild and cultivated lettuce species (Lactuca spp., L. serriola
    and L. sativa) and lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) illustrate this scenario
    and are discussed below. In contrast, where WPP systems are based around species
    with no close genetic affinity, neither the advantage of a source of resistance
    nor the disadvantage posed by pathogen reservoirs exist. However, such WPPs (as
    seen in the literature around the Filipendula/Triphragmium, Plantago/Podosphaera,
    and Linum/Melampsora systems: summarized by Burdon and Laine 2019) provide more
    fundamental understanding of why WPP and CPP differ and potentially how agricultural
    systems could be made more sustainable. CPPs A CPP (agricultural pathosystem,
    in sensu Robinson 1976) is more or less deterministic (Table 1) and in comparison
    to a WPP, has a fourth component, human-controlled disease management (the disease
    tetrahedron) (Agrios 2005). CPPs are part of agroecosystems (Conway 1987) in which
    humans are highly influential factors because of their direct control of (i) the
    genetic identity of individual plants or plant populations (cultivars of crops);
    (ii) cultivation systems: (iii) some microclimatic (ecological) factors; and (iv)
    to a lesser extent their influence on the size and genetic structure of pathogen
    populations (disease management). In addition though, CPPs lack many of the features
    that create diversity and have been shown could theoretically stabilize gene-for-gene
    coevolution in agriculture (Brown and Tellier 2011; Tellier and Brown 2009). Unfortunately,
    the theory and concept of CPPs is still not applied in a broad sense in agroecology
    textbooks, which typically only incorporate basic information about herbivores
    and parasites as a part of agroecosystems and community trophic structure (Carroll
    et al. 1990; Gliessman 1998). Sometimes CPPs are called “man-made systems” (Zadoks
    and Schein 1979). Agriculture frequently results in simplified ecosystems, with
    a low level of complexity, in which humans alter the natural equilibrium between
    plants and pathogens (González-Domínguez et al. 2020). Because of human manipulation
    of the resistance of the host and the consequent effect on evolution within these
    pathosystems (Zadoks 2005), this process has been described as man-guided evolution
    (Johnson 1961). This is the reason why these pathosystems are characterized by
    high instability and by a vicious boom-and-bust cycle (Zadoks and Schein 1979),
    which is accelerated by the increasingly rapid introduction of new host cultivars
    with new or different pathotype (race)-specific resistance gene combinations (Lebeda
    and Zinkernagel 2003) and by the deployment of novel fungicides against which
    the pathogens evolve tolerance or resistance (Hollomon 2015; Lebeda et al. 2010;
    Lebeda and Cohen 2012). The main differences between WPPs and CPPs are described
    in Table 1. Differences between WPP and CPP General ecological view. A logical
    starting point for an assessment of differences between wild and agricultural
    plant pathosystems is in a comparison of their respective ecologies (Carroll et
    al. 1990; Odum 1997; Zadoks and Schein 1979) and how individual component differences
    may affect the dynamics of the host–pathogen interactions. The fundamental difference
    between natural and agroecosystems is the omnipresence of the effect of the activities
    of humankind that directly relate to the structure and functioning of agroecosystems.
    Ecosystems can be considered and examined according to a hierarchy of organization
    of their components at different levels (individual organisms, population, community,
    and ecosystem). A crucial factor to be recognized is that at each level of organization
    properties emerge that were not present at the level below (i.e., emergent properties),
    as result of the interactions of the component parts of specific levels of the
    ecosystem (Gliessman 1998). The functioning of all ecosystems is primarily based
    on dynamic processes including energy flow, nutrient cycling, population regulation,
    and ecosystem changes (i.e., succession processes, resilience, climax, and dynamic
    equilibrium) (Odum and Barrett 2005). These and some other structural components
    and processes differ between natural and agroecosystems; in turn, these dissimilarities
    drive specific features of both wild and agricultural plant pathosystems (Table
    1). Plant pathology view. Plant pathosystems can be part (a subsystem) of a natural
    ecosystem and/or of an agroecosystem. This concept is helpful for understanding
    nature and/or agriculture as a system, as well as the natural place and function
    of plant disease, the evolution of pathogenicity and plant resistance, the effects
    of agriculture or man-made ecosystems on host−parasite relationships, and the
    role of humans as a part of an ecosystem (Zadoks and Schein 1979). Study of plant
    diseases at the population, community, or ecosystem level is a task of epidemiology
    (Madden et al. 2007). However, until now there has been no established comparative
    epidemiology of plant diseases in WPPs and CPPs. Prevailing studies and knowledge
    have been mostly focused on CPPs (Kranz 1990a, b, 2003; Madden et al. 2007), while,
    in contrast, epidemiological studies and knowledge of the function of plant diseases
    in WPPs are very limited (Burdon and Laine 2019; Kranz 1990a; Zadoks 2005). The
    consequence of this short-coming is an incomplete understanding of the ecological
    role of disease and host–pathogen (parasite) associations in WPPs. In turn, this
    has limited a better understanding of the importance and potential application
    of biodiversity in the management of plant diseases in CPPs. From a historical
    viewpoint, diseases in general, including plant diseases, were usually considered
    as something wrong, unusual, abnormal, and thus an unnatural enemy. However, this
    strictly anthropomorphic view runs contrary to a broader ecological view that
    has more recently recognized that plant pathogens and the diseases caused by them
    are integral, irreplaceable parts of nature (Burdon and Laine 2019), as well as
    inevitable parts of agriculture. Disease in plant pathosystems. Differences between
    agricultural and WPPs are many and, as is frequently the case when differences
    between two systems are multiple and complexly interrelated, it is near impossible
    to ascribe just one factor as having a dominant role (Table 1). Superficially,
    many of the differences between agricultural and wild ecosystems have the potential
    to strongly influence disease epidemiology. Thus, the efficient dispersal of pathogen
    propagules, whether by splash, wind, or direct contact, is aided by high plant
    densities, large individual host population sizes, and low stand species diversity
    (Burdon 1987a; Burdon and Laine 2019)—all features typically associated with very
    many agricultural systems. Subsequent pathogen germination, growth, and disease
    development on the host are frequently aided by high humidity and elevated plant
    nutrient status (Agrios 2005; Yarwood 1957). Again, these are features more associated
    with agroecosystems than many wild ecosystems, although micro-environments within
    the latter systems may be particularly favorable to pathogens and incur more disease
    (Jarosz and Burdon 1988; Laine 2006). Equally, two of the major impacts humans
    have on the natural world—the increasing fragmentation of natural habitats and
    the widespread effects of climate change—may also play out in subtly different
    ways in agricultural plant pathosystems and WPPs. Thus, depending on the dispersal
    ability of a pathogen, habitat fragmentation may reduce the “perceived” size of
    wild host populations and through this the frequency of local pathogen extinction.
    A potential evolutionary response by the pathogen would be a trend towards decreasing
    aggressiveness. Similarly, the consequences of rising temperatures and decreasing
    precipitation may play out in reduced survival of pathogen populations in small
    and isolated patches of hosts. One of the most notable features of WPPs is the
    marked diversity in resistance alleles and genes found in individual populations
    (Bevan et al. 1993; Burdon and Jarosz 1988; Burdon and Laine 2019; Lebeda et al.
    2008a). However, for obvious numerical reasons, very small patches may show little
    or no variation, while a similar paucity may occur in host populations growing
    in environments that are generally less favorable for pathogen mediated selection
    (Dinoor 1970). The number of resistance phenotypes detected in a single host population
    can often exceed 10—a stark contrast to the single resistance phenotypes found
    in individual fields of the majority of mechanized agricultural systems. Experimental
    manipulation and direct observation of wild pathosystems has also provided evidence
    that this diversity in resistance can lead to a reduction in epidemic development
    of Erysiphe cichoracearum on Solidago altissima (Schmidt 1994) and Melampsora
    lini on Linum marginale (Thrall and Burdon 2000). Those observations complement
    the extensive literature showing the impact of crop varietal mixtures in reducing
    disease and increasing pathogen variability (Finckh et al. 2000; Mundt 2002; Yang
    et al. 2019). Transitions between plant pathosystems. Both defined plant pathosystems
    are known in “pure form” (WPPs, in the wilderness with virtually no human influence;
    CPPs, part of agroecosystems, with strong and long-lasting human influence) and
    represent, in the most simplified view, two strictly defined categories. However,
    nature is much more variable and overlaps inevitably occur between wild ecosystems,
    agroecosystems, WPPs, and CPPs. As an example, we can use populations of weedy
    species growing in agricultural settings or populations of wild host species existing
    on unploughed islands inside an agroecosystem. Such communities may have many
    of the characteristics of WPPs, but of course are partly influenced by human activity,
    i.e., they are not completely autonomous. This is seen in the wild and common
    weed species, prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) and its descendent, the cultivated
    lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) (Lebeda et al. 2007, 2019; Uwimana et al. 2012), and
    their interactions with downy mildew (Bremia lactucae Regel) (Fig. 1) and powdery
    mildew (Golovinomyces bolayi Braun, Lebeda and Shin). This complex pathosystem
    has become established as a model for research of WPPs and their interactions
    with CPPs (Lebeda et al. 2008a, 2012a, 2013; Mieslerová et al. 2020). Such type
    of studies are still very rare; however, they may be important for using in plant
    breeding (Lebeda et al. 2014b) and the development of a better understanding of
    epidemiology of some pathogens based on “host jumps” or transfer from weedy growing
    plants to crops (Burdon and Thrall 2008; Lebeda et al. 2008a; Runge et al. 2021;
    Thines 2019). FIGURE 1 Schematic representation of differences between, and the

    Plant Pathosystems Detailed knowledge of plant pathosystem components, their function,
    and interaction is crucial for their holistic analysis, understanding, and practical
    exploitation. Each component described below is the subject of interest of many
    specialized scientific disciplines. Here we focus only on the most important aspects
    related to the studies of plant pathosystems. Host species and populations A huge
    diversity of plant species inhabit the earth where they are exposed to demographic,
    genetic, and evolutionary forces imposed by the abiotic and biotic environment
    (including pathogens and pests), while simultaneously playing a key role in the
    structure, function, and balance of ecosystems (Keddy 2017). Nobody knows the
    exact number of cultivated species although including ornamentals and other plants
    connected with gardening and landscaping, it is about 35,000 species (Khoshbakht
    and Hammer 2008). All these plants must be considered as a part of CPPs; however,
    some of their wild relatives (progenitors) or weeds are also part of WPPs. Interactions
    between plants and parasites draw on enormous variation at different organismal
    levels. In general, the background of this variation can be seen at the level
    of individuals. Wild and crop plants interacting with microorganisms are characterized
    by two main types of resistance expression—basic incompatibility (nonhost plant
    resistance, basic resistance) and basic compatibility (host plant resistance and/or
    susceptibility) (Lebeda 1984a; Niks and Marcel 2009). Nonhost resistance is the
    resistance shown by an entire plant species to all genetic variants of a pathogen
    (Heath 1997; Lebeda 1984a). This type of resistance is common in all pathosystems
    as all plant species are resistant to most of the potential pathogens. In contrast,
    with some simplification, there are two main kinds of parasite-specific resistances
    identified by their phenotypic expression to the interaction: pathotype-specific
    and pathotype-nonspecific (formerly race-specific and race-nonspecific: Robinson
    1976). Pathotype-specific resistance is typically controlled by single dominant
    genes in the plant (Crute 1998), and because of its frequent presence in crop
    pathosystems was sometimes considered “an artifact of agriculture and plant breeding”
    (Barrett 1985). Pathotype-specific resistance is frequently associated with the
    fragility and instability of these systems (Table 1) and when used parsimoniously
    often leads to boom-and-bust cycles (Tronsmo et al. 2020). Studies of resistance
    variation in wild pathosystems confirms that this type of resistance is also very
    common in natural plant−parasite associations (Burdon et al. 1996; Lebeda et al.
    2002, 2008a; Mieslerová et al. 2020), as well as in wild progenitors of crop plants
    (Lebeda et al. 2014b; Parra et al. 2016). In contrast, pathotype-nonspecific resistance
    is often, but not exclusively, under the control of several or many genes (Crute
    1985). Pathotype-nonspecific resistance is not associated with boom-and-bust cycles
    (Robinson 1976). It has been identified in some wild plant progenitors (Lebeda
    et al. 2002), but for a variety of reasons has not been the target of investigation
    in many wild host–pathogen associations. Coevolutionary consequences, involving
    also reciprocal adaptation of interacting plant and pathogen (fungus) lineages,
    of the above mentioned types of resistance was discussed in detail by Heath (1997).
    Pathogens, pests, and their populations The impact of pests on plant populations,
    particularly insects (herbivores), have been the subject of extensive study—a
    direct contrast to the situation with respect to pathogens where, as stated by
    Harper (1977), “Pathogens have rarely been studied as part of ecological system
    in nature, and their relevance to population biology and population genetics is
    mainly unexplored territory.” Publication of the monograph “Diseases and Plant
    Population Biology” (Burdon 1987a) was a first step in an on-going process to
    change that situation (Burdon and Laine 2019; Lebeda and Burdon 2013a, b; Lebeda
    et al. 2014a). Pathogens and pests are an integral part of biosphere and ecosystem
    biodiversity, shaping trophic structures and cycles in natural ecosystems and
    agroecosystems, as well as in plant pathosystems (Lucas 2020; Tronsmo et al. 2020).
    Pathogens may affect the size, density, and genetic composition of plant populations
    in space and time, and they can also act as a selective force on plant-life history
    traits. The importance of pathogens in the ecology and evolution of plant populations
    depends on the frequency and severity of infection and the nature of the impact
    of the pathogen on its hosts relative to other biotic and abiotic features in
    the local environment (Burdon and Laine 2019; Clay and van der Putten 1999). Plants
    represent complex combinations of food niches exploited by pathogens and pests
    (Harper 1977). Under natural conditions (WPPs), parasitism is somewhat of a compromise
    between host plant and pathogen. Host and pathogen, evolve together over time
    and space, the host plant being tolerant of low-grade infection, the pathogen
    in many instances being dependent on continuity of the host''s life (Burdon and
    Laine 2019). However, in agroecosystems and CPPs, because of an imbalance in the
    components of the ecosystem (Table 1), the coevolutionary compromise between host
    plant and parasite is lost. In these circumstances, pathogens become unwanted
    organisms to be controlled or eliminated by humans (Zadoks and Schein 1979). The
    economic significance of plant pathogens, as unwanted organisms, lies in their
    destructive effects on the most important product of agroecosystems. Because of
    this potential, the importance of pathogen diversity is much better appreciated
    in agroecosystems and CPPs (English and Marois 1997) than in WPPs (Allen et al.
    1999). The diversity displayed among plant pathogens themselves and in their different
    nutritional and life strategies for effective parasitism is immense (Delaye et
    al. 2013), as is their modes of influence on host plants. Burdon (1993) summarized
    these by dividing plant pathogens into three groups according to modes of influence:
    (i) debilitators that cause discrete lesions that affect plant development to
    only some extent; (ii) castrators that reduce the fecundity of individual flowers
    and reproduction potential of plants; and (iii) killers that eliminate seedlings
    before or after emerging, or kill plants in different developmental stages. Plant
    pathogens are extremely variable not only from a taxonomic viewpoint, but also
    with respect to their pathogenicity. The reasons and mechanisms responsible for
    this variation have been described in detail elsewhere (Brown 1995; Burdon and
    Silk 1997; Milgroom 2015). In regard to variation in plant pathogens, the terms
    pathogenicity and nonpathogenicity, i.e., ability to cause disease or not, reflect
    the most important feature with two aspects of pathogenicity being infectivity
    (virulence) and aggressiveness. Infectivity is a qualitative expression of pathogenicity
    (uninfective/infective, i.e., binary system, 0 or 1) by pathogen strains, isolates,
    or pathotypes and their populations. This terminology is frequent in pathotype-specific
    host–pathogen interactions. The term aggressiveness, from the plant pathology
    viewpoint, describes the expression of quantitative degrees of pathogenicity,
    i.e., continuous values from 0 (nonpathogenic) to 100 (highly pathogenic) (Milgroom
    2015). Environment The environment that individual organisms find themselves in
    is a complex amalgam of abiotic and biotic factors that individually, and collectively,
    influence the structure and behavior of ecosystems and plant pathosystems (Tronsmo
    et al. 2020; Velásquez et al. 2018). The complexity of the environment and the
    way in which its various components interact simultaneously, synergistically,
    or sometimes competitively is well recognized in the study of natural ecosystems
    and recognized as a contributory force to evolutionary change (Burdon and Laine
    2019). However, a weakness of many agroecosystem studies is that they ignore the
    interaction of abiotic and biotic factors and other environmental complexities
    (Gliessman 1998). Plant pathologists and epidemiologists have to rely on standard
    methods to measure meteorological, soil, and other factors. In addition though,
    there are some micro-scale weather factors, not considered in standard meteorological
    considerations that are crucial in disease epidemiology. These include leaf wetness
    and dew, precipitation intensity, and droplet size. Infection processes in plants
    are mostly completed within a few hours (e.g., in biotrophs); however, there are
    some pathogens (e.g., wood destroying fungi) that need weeks, months, or years
    (Kranz 1990b). Nevertheless, despite this scale difference, because meteorological
    and micoclimatic data are well related (Aust and Hoyningen-Huene 1986), basic
    weather data have often proved satisfactory for establishing causal relationships
    between environmental factors and host–pathogen interactions. Indeed, these data
    are frequently used for modelling and disease forecasting of the most important
    plant diseases in CPPs (González-Domínguez et al. 2020; Newlands 2018; Tronsmo
    et al. 2020; Zayan 2019), although such approaches and methodology are still under-utilized
    in epidemiological studies of WPPs (Islam 2018). There is abundant literature
    on relationships between climatic factors and individual diseases in CPPs (Newlands
    2018); however, very little is known about their possibly differential effects
    on diseases in wild plants and their communities (Kranz 1990a). Because of specific
    weather−disease relationships for individual pathosystems, climatic factors also
    determine disease prevalence and intensities in plant communities, which can differ
    from year to year, and from one WPP to another. This environmental variation has
    an effect on the extent to which pathogens are involved in selection processes
    within plant wild communities (Kranz 1990a). To date only a fraction of the dynamic
    plant−pathogen−environment interactions that occur in nature have been documented.
    There is great need for future research to increasingly recognize the dynamic
    nature of environmental conditions in order to fully understand the multidimensional
    nature of plant−pathogen interactions (Velásquez et al. 2018). The upsurge in
    concern about global warming and its potential impact on host–pathogen associations
    (Shaw and Osborne 2011) has led to an increasing awareness of climate change on
    disease in wild plant populations (Burdon and Zhan 2020; Jeger 2022) with a focus
    on future impacts on plant, environmental, and ecosystem health (Zhan et al. 2018).
    Man and agriculture Agriculture is defined as the manipulation of the natural
    ecosystem by substituting domesticated species for wild species in appropriate
    ecological niches (Harris 1969). From the viewpoint of this paper, the question
    of the origins and processes of plant domestication is probably the most important.
    Domestication did not take place worldwide, but only in limited areas described
    as centers of origin of crop plants and/or centers of diversity (Hummer and Hancock
    2015). Domestication occurred over a relatively short time span (beginning over
    10,000 years ago), was confined to a limited list of plant families (approximately
    10), and typically tapped only a limited part of the diversity of each ancestral
    species (Wood and Lenné 1999a, b). Furthermore, there is an evolutionary and ecological
    continuum linking wild-pre-domesticates with present-day cultivars (Frankel et
    al. 1995)—a continuum that is particularly seen in disease resistance in wild
    plants and its role in the domestication process (Vavilov 1951). Plant−microbe
    associations and plant defense mechanisms are areas of interaction that are potentially
    heavily affected during domestication (so-called domestication syndrome [Smýkal
    et al. 2018]). Indeed, it has often been suggested that crops have evolved reduced
    defenses against pests and pathogens in comparison with their wild progenitors
    (Chen et al. 2015). In response, in recent years there has been an increasing
    research effort to understand the effect of domestication on the plant microbiome
    but evolutionary theories that explain how the assembly of domesticated plant
    microbiomes differs from those of wild progenitors are still lacking (Soldan et
    al. 2021). In modern day western agriculture, crop varieties no longer show the
    tremendous genetic variability in morphology, growth rhythm, ecological adaptation,
    and disease resistance found in early crop plants and/or old landraces (Zadoks
    and Schein 1979). From the pathosystem point of view, this often translates into
    disease or pest resistance erosion and/or breakdown (Montarry et al. 2012). The
    gene-for-gene theory provided an explanation of coevolutionary processes and the
    ‘boom-bust’ cycle seen in many host–pathogen combinations (Burdon and Laine 2019).
    As a new resistant variety occupies an increasing area (the ‘boom’), selection
    pressure against the matching avirulence in the pathogen population increases.
    If the host resistance is based on a single R-gene, the vulnerability of the variety
    is rapidly exposed as a single mutation event creating a new infective pathotype
    thereby rendering the resistance ineffective (the ‘bust’) (Pink and Hand 2002).
    A major contributory factor to this imbalance has been modern plant breeding,
    the simplified ecology of agricultural crops and crop agronomic practices (Brown
    and Tellier 2011; Singer et al. 2021) that have encouraged genetic uniformity
    within agroecosystems and sped the interaction processes. During the last few
    decades, increasing attention has been focused on breeding strategies that try
    to mimic some of the advantages of natural ecosystems by utilizing and exploiting
    crop wild relatives. They have been increasingly, successfully used as gene donors
    for improving crops (Maxted and Vincent 2021), including as a sources of pest
    and disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, and breeding efficiency traits
    (Dempewolf et al. 2017; Lebeda et al. 2002, 2009a, 2014b). Being wild plants,
    these genetic resources may be threatened by habitat destruction, climate change,
    invasive species, and other impacts (Díaz et al. 2019; Jarvis et al. 2008) and
    have thus been prioritized for conservation both in germplasm collections/repositories
    (Castañeda-Álvarez et al. 2016) and in their natural habitats (Khoury et al. 2019;
    Maxted and Kell 2009). This strategy shows that instead of relying solely on artificial
    sources of variation and breeding strategies there is an increasing appetite to
    use knowledge of the structure and behaviour of WPPs to shape agricultural plant
    improvement programs. Why Study WPPs Why are wild communities the way they are?
    How do they change over time? And what role do pathogens play in determining the
    outcomes we see? The fundamental reasons for studying WPPs are variable, reflecting
    the diverse and yet overlapping interests of ecologists and conservation biologists,
    foresters, and agriculturalists and the diversity of approaches adopted by evolutionary
    biologists, plant pathologists, geneticists, and plant breeders. For the forester,
    the aim is to understand the spread of disease, how to modify the impact of endemic
    diseases, and how to prevent the entry of exotic ones. For conservation biologists,
    the driving emphasis is on how to maintain the status quo. However, for evolutionary
    biologists with an interest in agriculture, the focus is on understanding the
    demographic, epidemiological, and evolutionary trajectories of both host and pathogen,
    and how these change in both time and space. While recognizing that disease incidence
    and severity typically differs between the two pathosystems, and that there are
    many potential reasons for those differences, agriculture''s heavy reliance on
    genetic and chemical control over the last century has typically provided only
    short-term respite. Are there clues to be gleaned from wild pathosystems as to
    how to increase the sustainability of crop pathosystem control methods? One of
    the most obvious and immediate benefits of an understanding of the forces driving
    diversity in resistance in wild systems is the direction it gives to the search
    for novel resistance genes or alleles that might be incorporated into appropriate
    breeding programs. Studies of landraces and wild crop relatives deposited in ex-situ
    collections have been an important source of knowledge regarding broad patterns
    of adaptation within species to a range of climatic, edaphic, and biotic factors
    (Bellon et al. 2017). At the same time though, ex-situ collections are frozen
    snap-shots in time reflecting the genetic diversity present in the population
    at the time of collecting. However, such diversity may change through time as
    a consequence of two different processes, the understanding of which enhances
    the importance of ex-situ conservation of wild relatives and the contribution
    they may make to agricultural production through time. Thus, micro-evolutionary
    change in the relative frequency of alleles that were missed due to their extreme
    rarity at the time of sampling (Ibrahim and Barrett 1991; Thrall et al. 2012)
    may increase their frequency to the point at which they are readily collected
    at a future point in time. A deeper understanding of the fundamental de novo origin
    of truly novel resistance alleles suggests that wild pathosystems are also engine
    rooms for the evolution of novel resistance specificities (Richter et al. 1995).
    The in-depth study of resistance and pathogenicity variation within and among
    different host and pathogen populations at both the local scale, where there is
    more or less gene flow between individual populations (metapopulations), and more
    distant regional or continental scalesprovides an increasingly clear picture of
    the evolutionary trajectories followed as a consequence of frequency-dependent
    selection pressures (Burdon and Laine 2019). Resistance genes and alleles are
    very commonly found across wild pathosystems and a limited number of studies have
    shown how these are packaged as either single or multiple genes within individual
    plants (Burdon 1987b, 1994; Jarosz and Burdon 1990). While it must always be remembered
    that assessments based on the number of visually determined resistance phenotypes
    will always be at least partly dependent on the number of screening pathotypes,
    and hence the numbers determined are a minimum, the number of different resistances
    reported in individual populations vary from 0 to 10 or more (Burdon and Laine
    2019). The advent of sequencing of resistance gene analogs (RGAs) allowed for
    a more complete assessment (although not distinguishing between function and nonfunctional
    gene sequences) to expand this perspective with, for example, 400 RGAs identified
    in the genome of Populus trichocarpa (Tuskan et al. 2006) and 225 in Ipomoea batatas
    (Wang et al. 2010). Furthermore, comparison of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
    base-pair substitutions has provided evidence of selection pressures favoring
    novel alleles. Using differential sets of host lines, many studies have also shown
    the occurrence of a similar diversity of different pathotypes in wild pathosystems
    (Burdon and Laine 2019). Interestingly, the few studies that allow comparisons
    of individual pathogen population structure through time show that while one particular
    pathotype may be present for many years, its frequency may fluctuate markedly
    over that time (Susi et al. 2017). Various past studies have provided evidence
    of changing frequencies of resistance phenotypes in individual wild host–pathogen
    populations (Burdon and Thompson 1995). However, it was only relatively recently
    that a detailed multi-year assessment of six separate individual Linum marginale
    (host)−Melampsora lini (rust pathogen) interactions, that were all part of a single
    local area metapopulation, clearly demonstrated the impact of frequency-dependent
    selection operating in wild systems. Over this period, the resistance and pathogenicity
    structure of the six individual patches waxed and waned. Three populations showed
    strong evidence of frequency-dependent reciprocal change in both host resistance
    and pathogen infectivity, at one site only the host was evolving, at another only
    the pathogen was changing, while at the last neither host nor pathogen population
    structure changed (Thrall et al. 2012). These and other studies clearly point
    to the dynamic nature of genetic interactions in WPPs. They elucidate the importance
    of frequency-dependent selection in generating interactions in which not all host
    genotypes in a population are susceptible to all pathogen isolates, and in which
    pathogen phenotypes are similarly constrained in their infectivity and aggressiveness
    with increasing infectivity being associated with decreasing aggressiveness (Thrall
    and Burdon 2003). This contrasts markedly with most agricultural systems where
    the human-enforced uniformity of crops imposes strong directional selection pressure
    on pathogen populations to be dominated by infective pathotypes with high aggressiveness.
    A strong message for agricultural disease control from the study of natural systems
    is then to search for ways of incorporating agronomic, management, and genetic
    practices that present pathogens with a fluctuating and less predictable target.
    This strategy is sometimes called “dynamic diversity” (McDonald 2014). What are
    the differences and connections between wild WPPs and CPPs and why are they important
    for agriculture: A case study of Lactuca (L. serriola and L. sativa) and Bremia
    lactucae This section presents a synthesis of differences between two plant pathosystems—wild
    and crop—involving the same pathogen, B. lactucae, and its wild (L. serriola)
    or cultivated (L. sativa) hosts and their interactions. To date such studies have
    been extremely limited for a number of logistic reasons, their complexity (Fig.
    1), a tendency for funding to be siloed into specific discipline areas, and perhaps
    most importantly, a lack of understanding of their relevance to disease control
    and developments in crop plant breeding strategies (Crute 1992; Lebeda et al.
    2007, 2014b; Ondrej et al. 2021). Host plant (L. sativa, L. serriola). Cultivated
    lettuce (L. sativa L.) is characterized by considerable genetic diversity resulting
    from its origin, complex domestication process, and long history of breeding for
    diverse morphotypes, disease, and pest resistance (Lebeda et al. 2007, 2014b;
    Wei et al. 2021). Prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.), the wild ancestor of
    cultivated lettuce (Lebeda et al. 2007; Wei et al. 2021), is considered native
    to North (Mediterranean) and East Africa; West, Central, and South Asia; and to
    Europe, and is naturalized in much of the rest of the world. It is a pioneer plant
    of open habitats including screes, quarries, ruins, and occurs in agricultural
    fields as a common weed and invasive plant (Lebeda et al. 2004). During the last
    few decades, this species has spread widely (D''Andrea et al. 2017) outside its
    original distribution (Feráková 1977). L. serriola is geographically and genetically
    very variable (D''Andrea et al. 2017; Jemelková et al. 2018; Kitner et al. 2015;
    Lebeda et al. 2009b). The genetic diversity of lettuce (L. sativa), its landraces
    and wild relatives, is characterized by considerable variation in resistance to
    pathogens and pests (Lebeda et al. 2014b) including lettuce downy mildew (B. lactucae)—one
    of the most important diseases of this crop (Spring et al. 2018). Great resistance
    variation (Lebeda 1984b) and more than 60 mostly pathotype-specific R-genes and
    R-factors for resistance to B. lactucae have been reported in lettuce with many
    of these genes being derived from L. serriola (Parra et al. 2016). L. serriola
    has been the commonest sources of pathotype-specific resistance used in lettuce
    breeding, although some other wild Lactuca species (e.g., L. saligna, L. virosa,
    and L. aculeata) have been exploited (Lebeda et al. 2002, 2007, 2014b; Parra et
    al. 2016). A metapopulation approach was applied to studies of European populations
    of L. serriola and their resistance to 10 pathotypes of B. lactucae (Petrželová
    and Lebeda 2011). Data indicated that pathotype-specific resistance is the most
    common type of resistance in the European L. serriola metapopulation, with large
    variation being found among and within populations in individual countries, although
    resistance to some pathotypes was distributed unevenly among geographical regions.
    Further, there were clear geographic differences in genetic diversity with a clear
    gradient of increasing uniformity of pathotype specificity along an axis from
    central (Czech Republic and Germany) to western Europe (United Kingdom), as well
    as a decrease in the diversity of resistance phenotypes. Populations in the United
    Kingdom were the most divergent in terms of resistance structure in comparison
    with continental Europe and also the most homogeneous (Petrželová and Lebeda 2011).
    These results confirmed the importance of viewing population studies over larger
    geographic areas in a metapopulation context (Thrall and Burdon 2002). From an
    agricultural production point of view, this study yielded new and unknown sources
    of pathotype-specific resistance useful for further lettuce breeding (Petrželová
    and Lebeda 2011). Our studies of the Lactuca spp.–B. lactucae plant pathosystem
    clearly showed that we must consider the complexity of interactions or “cross-talk”
    between WPPs and CPPs and vice versa (Fig. 1) from two viewpoints, i.e., detrimental
    and beneficial. These studies showed that pathogen strains or v-genes from WPPs
    can jump and overcome lettuce (L. sativa) resistance (mostly pathotype/race-specific)
    derived from wild lettuce (L. serriola and some others; Parra et al. 2016) and
    cause disease on previously resistant cultivars (Lebeda 1984c, 1986, 1989, 2002).
    On the other hand, detailed studies of wild Lactuca progenitors demonstrated that
    there is enormous genetic variation in their wild populations, which could be
    very useful in gene-mining and further lettuce breeding and function in disease
    control (Jeuken 2012; Lebeda et al. 2002, 2008a, 2014b; Petrželová and Lebeda
    2011; Petrželová et al. 2011; van Treuren et al. 2013) against pathogen populations
    occurring on commercial L. sativa (Petrželová et al. 2013; Souza et al. 2022).
    Additional basic results and conclusions about this topic are also summarized
    elsewhere (Spring et al. 2018) and involved in different parts of our current
    paper. Pathogen (B. lactucae). Lettuce downy mildew (B. lactucae Regel) is a major
    disease of lettuce (Crute 1992) with worldwide distribution (Lebeda et al. 2002;
    Spring et al. 2018). It prefers regions with temperate and subtropical climates,
    and may attack the plant throughout its crop cycle (Spring et al. 2018). Recent
    molecular phylogenetic data confirmed the diversity of B. lactucae sensu lato
    and contributed to the separation of more than 10 distinct Bremia species (Choi
    and Thines 2015), mostly with narrow host spectra. As a consequence, it is clear
    that only Bremia infections on Lactuca species pose a significant risk for lettuce
    production. Generally, isolates of B. lactucae originating from L. sativa may
    infect L. serriola and vice versa, and some other wild Lactuca species (Lebeda
    et al. 2002); however, the interaction is pathotype-specific and results depend
    on the presence and/or absence of specific infectivity factors (v-factors) or
    resistance factors (R-factors) (Lebeda 1984b). From recent field studies in the
    Czech Republic, it is evident that the most common weedy host species of B. lactucae
    is L. serriola (Lebeda et al. 2008a), but the epidemiological impact of B. lactucae
    on wild Lactuca spp. is not well known. Quantitative results in the same region
    showed that lettuce downy mildew on L. serriola was both temporally and spatially
    rather common and infected approximately 75 to 80% of the natural host populations.
    However, the degree of incidence and prevalence of symptom expression on infected
    plants and their populations was rather low (Fig. 2). No boom-and-bust cycle was
    recorded and a long-lasting dynamic equilibrium between host and pathogen populations
    is expected (Lebeda et al. 2008a; Mieslerová et al. 2013). Nevertheless, enormous
    variation and heterogeneity was found in the expression of macroscopic symptom
    response on naturally infected leaves of L. serriola (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda et al.
    2008a). This probably reflects differences in the genetic background of the resistance
    in individual plants and their populations, as well as responses to differences
    in the local environment (Lebeda et al. 2008a). FIGURE 2 Temporal fluctuation
    in incidence and prevalence of Bremia lactucae in natural populations of Lactuca
    serriola in the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2009. Figure shows among-year fluctuations
    in proportion to healthy (noninfected = 0) and B. lactucae-infected (disease prevalence
    = 1 to 3) populations of L. serriola within all populations surveyed in a given
    year. Disease prevalence: proportion of individuals within a population diseased
    with B. lactucae. A visual 0 to 3 scale was used for expressing different levels
    of disease prevalence (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda et al. 2008a): 0 = no symptoms of B.
    lactucae infection in a surveyed L. serriola population; 1 = low disease prevalence;
    2 = medium disease prevalence; and 3 = high disease prevalence (adapted according
    to Lebeda et al. 2008a; data for 2007 to 2009 newly added). Download as PowerPoint
    Disease incidence and prevalence in L. sativa crop pathosystems was very variable
    and dependent on the cultivars used, the occurrence of various pathotypes, and
    local weather conditions, and showed considerable fluctuation between years (Petrželová
    et al. 2013). However, under European conditions, pathotype-specific resistance
    has repeatedly been overcome (Lebeda and Schwinn 1994; Lebeda and Zavadil 1979;
    Lebeda and Zinkernagel 2003; Spring et al. 2018), demonstrating a mostly 2 to
    4 year boom-and-bust cycle that is characteristic of the limited stability and
    durability of lettuce resistance against B. lactucae in crop pathosystems (Lebeda
    and Zinkernagel 2003). Considerable variation in the infectivity of B. lactucae
    individuals and populations occurring on cultivated lettuce (L. sativa) has been
    known for nearly a century (Crute and Dixon 1981; Lebeda 1981; Petrželová et al.
    2013; Spring et al. 2018). However, it was only in the 1980s that evidence was
    obtained showing the wild pathosystem involving B. lactucae and L. serriola exhibited
    a similar pattern as the crop pathosystem with various pathotypes of B. lactucae
    with different v-phenotypes (Lebeda 1979a, b). Their infectivity patterns (v-phenotypes)
    were highly specific and mostly completely different from those found in the L.
    sativa crop pathosystem (Lebeda 1984c, 2002). At the individual level, most v-phenotypes
    of B. lactucae found in WPPs were characterized by v-factors that match resistances
    (Dm genes/R-factors) carried by L. serriola. The most common v-factors were v7,
    v15, v16, and v23 to v30, whereas v-factors (e.g., v1, v2, v 3, v4, and v10),
    matching Dm genes derived from L. sativa, were very rare (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda
    and Petrželová 2004; Petrželová and Lebeda 2004). It was evident that B. lactucae
    isolates originating from WPPs were mostly characterized by different v-factors
    and a rather low complexity of v-phenotypes (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda and Petrželová
    2004) in comparison with isolates originating from CPPs (Lebeda 1982; Petrželová
    et al. 2013), thereby demonstrating the close adaptation of B. lactucae infectivity
    to its host genetic background. However, a few isolates, for example ones with
    a very similar v-phenotype to pathotype NL16 (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda and Blok 1991)
    did not fit this pattern being more like “L. sativa type” isolates without v-factors
    matching the prevalent Dm genes originating from L. serriola. This surprising
    phenomenon was interpreted as evidence of potential connections between CPPs and
    WPPs and vice versa (Lebeda 2002). Further details and interpretation of this
    phenomenon are summarized in a consideration of cross-talk between WPPs and CPPs
    (see below and Fig. 1). Population and spatiotemporal studies of B. lactucae infectivity
    variation in WPPs (L. serriola) and their comparison with CPPs (L. sativa) yielded
    a more detailed view of the infectivity structure and dynamics of both pathosystems
    (Lebeda and Petrželová 2004; Lebeda et al. 2008a; Petrželová and Lebeda 2004;
    Petrželová et al. 2013). As an example, we give here data related to v-factors
    v1 to v30 (excluding v-factors v9, v19-22) for the years 2004 to 2007 in the Czech
    Republic. Variation in infectivity and its temporal change was quantified by measuring
    the relative frequencies of v-factors in the tested isolates (Lebeda 1981, 1982;
    Fig. 3). With the exception of v18, most of the v-factors were found in populations
    of B. lactucae occurring on L. serriola throughout the study period. Nevertheless,
    there were substantial differences in the frequencies recorded for individual
    v-factors (Fig. 3). Medium to high frequencies were recorded for v-factors v5/8,
    v7, v11, v14 to v17, and v23 to v30. In contrast, factors v1 to v4, v6, v10, v12,
    and v13 were detected at extremely low frequencies (Fig. 3). Frequencies of v-factors
    remained essentially similar from year to year (Lebeda et al. 2008a, unpublished
    data). Infectivity patterns recorded for individual isolates as v-phenotypes were
    also variable (Lebeda and Petrželová 2004; Petrželová and Lebeda 2004). The complexity
    of recorded B. lactucae v-phenotypes varied broadly, while an index of infectivity
    complexity (number detected v-factors/total v-factors detected; Lebeda (1982))
    ranged between 0.10 to 0.59, indicating v-complexity was low to medium. Infectivity
    complexity also varied between spatially isolated populations and within individual
    pathogen populations (Lebeda et al. 2008a). FIGURE 3 Comparison of frequencies
    (ratio between number of Bremia lactucae isolates with given v-factor: total number
    of isolates analyzed) of v-factors recorded in the Czech populations of B. lactucae
    on Lactuca sativa (CPP) and L. serriola (WPP) from 2004 to 2007. Total number
    of tested B. lactucae isolates (2004 to 2007) originating from L. sativa (n =
    51) and L. serriola (n = 200). v-factors: v1, v2, v3, v4, v10, v12, v13, and v14
    = v-factors matching Dm genes or R-factors in cultivars of L. sativa; v7, v15,
    v16, v17, and v23 to v30 = v-factors matching Dm genes or R-factors in genotypes
    of L. serriola; and v5/8, v6, v11, and v18 = v-factors matching Dm genes or R-factors
    in cultivars of L. sativa derived from L. serriola (adapted according to Lebeda
    et al. (2008a) and Petrželová et al. (2013); data for v-factors of B. lactucae
    from L. serriola in the years 2006 to 2007 newly added). Download as PowerPoint
    In the same period, B. lactucae infectivity was examined in the crop pathosystem
    represented by cultivated lettuce (L. sativa) (Fig. 3). At the individual level,
    isolates exhibited a broad variation in infectivity. The most frequently detected
    factors were v1 to v4, v5/8, v6, v7, v10 to v14, and v16; i.e., v-factors matching
    R-genes from L. sativa but also some from L. serriola. A broad diversity of v-phenotypes
    was identified during the study period, however no pathotype carrying all detected
    v-factors was detected (Petrželová et al. 2013), although such a pathotype was
    previously detected in this pathogen population (Lebeda 1979b). However, v-phenotypes
    differed substantially from those detected in WPP. The numbers of v-factors per
    v-phenotype varied within a range of 5 to 15. The index of infectivity complexity
    range of between 0.26 to 0.79, and was higher than that in the WPP, while across
    the whole population only a few isolates had relatively low v-phenotype complexity
    (0.26 and 0.37). From Figure 3, its evident that there are substantial differences
    in v-factors frequencies in both pathogen populations (WPPs versus CPPs). In pathogen
    populations associated with CPPs, all v-factors matching R-genes originating from
    L. sativa were at very high frequencies; while in contrast, v-factors matching
    R-genes originating from L. serriola (e.g., R15, R17, and R18) were present at
    low frequencies. It is evident that the infectivity structure of natural populations
    of B. lactucae in the WPP is very specific and different from pathogen populations
    in CPP. The majority of B. lactucae isolates originating from WPPs expressed clear
    genetic affinity to different L. serriola accessions and vice versa. Despite this
    general distinction, the pathogen populations in WPPs could be the source of infection
    of commercially grown lettuce cultivars in CPPs and breakdown of resistances originating
    from L. serriola (Lebeda et al. 2008a) as was demonstrated experimentally at least
    for one pathotype-specific R-gene (Dm11) originating from L. serriola (Lebeda
    1989). Interactions between pathosystems (Lactuca spp.–B. lactucae), cross-talk
    of WPPs, and CPPs and vice versa Research into the complex cross-talk between
    WPPs and CPPs is still very limited with the interactions between the wild and
    cultivated Lactuca spp.–B. lactucae associations being one of the first studies
    focused on its complexity. From Figure 1, it is evident that there are many potential
    direct or indirect, horizontal and vertical, or diagonal interactions between
    the two pathosystems and their components. From a simple general view, we can
    consider interactions: A = WPP versus B = CPP and vice versa. However, these interactions
    could also be considered from a horizontal perspective, i.e., between the host
    plant populations (i.e., A−C versus B−C and vice versa) and the pathogen populations
    (A−D versus B−D and vice versa) of both pathosystems. Equally though, these interactions
    could be considered from vertical perspective (A−D versus B−D) and their cross-talk
    (Fig. 1). All these interactions may happen via many different routes and be influenced
    in many different ways, for example, as a consequence of natural or human-generated
    forces or a mixture (migration, gene flow, sexual reproduction, herbicide and
    fungicide application, cultivar changes, and cultivation methods etc.). Here we
    provide some examples of these complicated interactions. The host species (L.
    serriola and L. sativa) interaction perspective. Recent studies have shown that
    gene flow through hybridization could be a more frequent phenomenon between crop
    species and their wild relatives than previously expected (Ellstrand et al. 1999).
    From the viewpoint of our pathosystem (Fig. 1), and the interaction A−C and B−C
    and vice versa, interspecific gene flow can lead to the formation of hybrid populations
    that have a competitive advantage over parental populations. L. serriola has recently
    expanded in Europe (D''Andrea et al. 2017) and hybridization with cultivated lettuce
    has been hypothesized as one of the mechanisms behind this expansion (Uwimana
    et al. 2012). L. sativa and L. serriola are basically self-pollinators; however,
    out-crossing rates of 1 to 5% among L. sativa varieties (Thompson et al. 1958)
    and interspecific hybridization rates of up to 2.5% between the two species have
    been reported (D''Andrea et al. 2008). Application of STRUCTURE analysis confirmed
    the occurrence of hybrids at a level of 7% across Europe (Uwimana et al. 2012).
    Natural hybridization between closely related Lactuca (L. aculeata and L. serriola)
    species was also confirmed by other authors (Kitner et al. 2015; Lebeda et al.
    2012b). From these data, it is evident that cross-talk between these species in
    two different plant pathosystems is possible and may contribute to genetic variation.
    However, it is unlikely that resistance genes from L. serriola introduced into
    L. sativa will result in durable resistance of lettuce to downy mildew disease,
    because B. lactucae isolates and pathotypes from both hosts form a population
    continuum (Choi and Thines 2015; Runge et al. 2021). The pathogen (B. lactucae)
    interaction perspective. This perspective focuses on A−D and B−D populations and
    vice versa (Fig. 1). B. lactucae is diploid for the majority of its lifecycle
    and predominantly heterothallic (Michelmore and Ingram 1980). Heterothallism seems
    to be determined by two haplotypes at a single locus, with the B1 compatibility
    type being conferred by a homozygous recessive condition and the B2 mating type
    by a heterozygous condition (Michelmore and Wong 2008). The two mating types segregate
    in approximately 1:1 ratios in sexual progeny (Michelmore and Ingram 1981). The
    prevalence of each mating type varies in nature. Isolates of both mating types
    have been frequently identified on L. sativa and L. serriola in Europe, United
    States, and Brazil, although the B2 type sometimes predominated (Lebeda and Blok
    1990; Michelmore and Wong 2008; Petrželová and Lebeda 2003; Souza et al. 2022).
    This is consistent with a sexually reproducing population and the high diversity
    of v-phenotypes observed (Michelmore and Wong 2008). The occurrence of B. lactucae
    mating types was studied in a set of isolates originating from naturally infected
    wild populations of L. serriola (Petrželová and Lebeda 2003). Both compatibility
    types were recorded; however, the majority of the isolates (96%) were determined
    as type B2, supporting the observation that sexual reproduction of B. lactucae
    on wild L. serriola plants is rare (Petrželová and Lebeda 2003). Isolates of B.
    lactucae originating from L. sativa and L. serriola are not completely compatible
    when pairing together to produce oospores under laboratory conditions (Petrželová
    and Lebeda 2003). This is evidence for at least some isolation and differentiation
    of the two pathosystems (L. sativa versus L. serriola–B. lactucae; i.e., A versus
    B [Fig. 1]). However, the natural formation of new pathotypes of B. lactucae through
    the crossing of pathogen isolates from both pathosystems, the formation of novel
    hybrids and subsequent gene flow between crop and wild lettuce pathosystems remains
    a possibility and a continuing threat to cultivated lettuce (Lebeda 2002; Lebeda
    et al. 2008a; Michelmore et al. 2009). The occurrence of B. lactucae isolates
    in both pathosystems with combined v-phenotype structures supports the potentiality
    of gene flow between the pathosystems. (Lebeda and Petrželová 2004; Petrželová
    and Lebeda 2004; Petrželová et al. 2013). The short distances between these pathosystems
    (Lebeda et al. 2008a) also favors the possibility of gene flow. Although long-distance
    dispersal or migration (Brown and Hovmøller 2002) is an important mechanism whereby
    disease may jump from patch to patch of susceptible hosts. The combined results
    of these studies and others into the epidemiology of downy mildew on cultivated
    lettuce (Runge et al. 2021) and repeated comparative infectivity analysis (Lebeda
    2002; Lebeda and Petrželová 2004; Lebeda et al. 2008a; Petrželová and Lebeda 2004)
    supports the idea that B. lactucae in WPPs and CPPs form a population continuum,
    with multiple shifts from wild to cultivated lettuce (Runge et al. 2021) (Fig.
    1). Implications in Crop Management Disease control measures and their application
    need to be well considered. Individual host–pathogen associations are parts of
    variably complex eco-evolutionary interactions in which individual changes in
    management practices are not necessarily isolated from other parts of the system.
    Rather any change introduced to limit disease increase is likely to instigate
    a cascade of other changes within the system. Whether this cascade ultimately
    causes other unexpected changes that lead to a reduction, an increase, or no change
    in the probability and intensity of disease remains to be seen (Burdon et al.
    2020; Zhan et al. 2014). For these reasons, in applying any change in management
    practices, be they genetic or agronomic, it is essential to strategize and consider
    all potential responses of the pathosystem to the proposed new approach. When
    this is done, it may be easier to argue for the implementation of defense in depth,
    in a combination of host genetics, agronomic practices, and the judicious use
    of agrochemicals, that is Integrated Pest Management (Lucas 2020). In contrast,
    the consequences of failing to do so have been demonstrated time and again as
    pathogens respond genetically to the deployment of single host resistance genes
    (Burdon et al. 2016). The argument that the deployment of resistance gene “pyramids”
    present pathogens with increasingly difficult evolutionary hurdles is attractive
    in theory, but two or three step jumps in pathogen infectivity mutation are not
    uncommon (Watson 1981), and increasingly we see evidence of the deliquescent nature
    of pathogen genomes as hybrids of quite distinct pathogens arise and present major
    disease control challenges in their own right (Friesen et al. 2006). Furthermore,
    the actual commercial provision of resistance gene pyramided varieties is very
    often misleading. The disease suppressing qualities of gene pyramids is dependent
    not on the number of resistance genes present in the variety of concern, but on
    how many of those genes are currently effective in preventing development of the
    current pathogen population. For example, many wheat varieties may carry four
    to six resistance genes but only one or two may actually be effective leaving
    the others, at best, to have no more than a residual effect. In a similar way,
    overuse of single fungicides with limited modes of action are often countered
    by the appearance of resistance within the pathogen population (Ishii 2006; van
    den Bosch and Gilligan 2008). In contrast to pyramiding pathotype-specific resistance
    genes/factors (Pink and Hand 2002), the use of nonhost resistance (NHR) in plant
    breeding remains a great challenge (Niks and Marcel 2009; Niks et al. 2019). This
    subject is directly related to the structure of WPPs and represents practical
    exploitation of the exciting question: “Why is it that many pathogens infect only
    one or a few related plant species, but not other related plant species?” (Niks
    and Marcel 2009). Recently nonhost resistance has been broadly discussed and well
    elaborated in lettuce breeding (Jeuken 2012; Lebeda et al. 2002, 2014b) following
    a much earlier suggestion of the action of nonhost resistance in the response
    of L. saligna to infection by B. lactucae (Lebeda 1986). L. saligna is sexually
    compatible with L. sativa (Giesbers et al. 2018). The concept of nonhost resistance
    in L. saligna has been studied in detail from a mechanistic (Lebeda et al. 2002,
    2008b), population (Petrželová et al. 2011), and a genetical viewpoint (Giesbers
    et al. 2018; Jeuken et al. 2008, 2009; Zhang et al. 2009). Recently some resistance
    factors (Dm and QTLs) were introduced from L. saligna to lettuce (Parra et al.
    2016). This resistance is expected to be durable (Lebeda et al. 2002, 2014b; Parra
    et al. 2016) as earlier studies (Jeuken 2012; Lebeda et al. 2014b) demonstrated
    that nonhost resistance is based on resistance factors from L. saligna and the
    genetic dose for NHR differs between accessions. These studies led to the conclusion
    that multilocus epistatic interactions might explain NHR (Giesbers et al. 2018)
    and its durability. In the near future, a much broader deployment of this type
    of resistance is expected in lettuce breeding (Jeuken 2012; Parra et al. 2016);
    however, it still requires further basic research and more knowledge for its efficient
    exploitation (Lebeda et al. 2016). Challenges and Limits of Future WPP Research
    and Application of Results Given its strong focus on disease in rapidly changing
    crop fields, with the notable exception of the subdiscipline of forest pathology,
    plant pathology as a whole has generally lacked a focus on long-lasting observations
    and research of diseases and their dynamics in natural plant populations, metapopulations,
    communities, ecosystems, and biomes. However, considerable progress in understanding
    their effects and processes in natural ecosystems has been made since the 1980s
    (Alexander 2010; Burdon 1987a; Burdon and Laine 2019; Burdon and Leather 1990;
    Lebeda and Burdon 2013b; Lebeda et al. 2014a; Thresh 1981). The goal of this article
    has been to consider principles of plant pathosystems and give a basic overview
    of current knowledge on host–pathogen interactions in natural plant pathosystems,
    and their direct or indirect relationships to crop pathosystems. The natural world
    is a great source of unknown information and scientific inspiration for future
    research and developments. Natural diversity in plant individuals, species, and
    communities is an extremely important source of new resistance genes (Khoury et
    al. 2019; Maxted and Vincent 2021; Yang et al. 2019) and their potential exploitation
    in plant breeding (Arora et al. 2019; Singer et al. 2021), as well as possible
    biotic agents for disease control (Zadoks and Schein 1979). The same is true about
    pathogen diversity, its nature, characterization, and theoretical and practical
    consequences (Allen et al. 1999). We need the most extensive research on genetic
    variation in plant resistance and pathogen infectivity outside of CPPs. It is
    also an important challenge to combine ecological and genetic studies, because
    we know very little about many of the key components of these interactions (Alexander
    2010). All these aspects, in relation to natural plant and pathogen populations
    and communities are crucial for a deeper understanding of the behavior of WPPs,
    as well as for guiding sustainable plant disease control strategies (Zhan et al.
    2015). Knowledge of the structure, function and dynamics of WPPs is crucial for
    an understanding of the mechanisms which regulate the ecological and evolutionary
    balance between host and pathogen populations (Burdon and Laine 2019). Underlying
    processes responsible for dynamic equilibria or homeostasis are not fully understood
    and explained in WPPs (Zadoks 2005). Certainly, the elegant theoretical work of
    Tellier and Brown (2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2009; Brown and Tellier 2011) provides
    a unifying explanation for stable equilibria in WPPs and boom-and-bust cycles
    in CPPs but this has yet to be verify experimentally. Such research, including
    studies of epidemiological and evolutionary trajectories in natural plant pathosystems,
    represent an important investment into the future (Burdon and Laine 2019; Kranz
    1990a; Zadoks 2005). From an epidemiological and coevolutionary viewpoint we need
    to learn considerably more about the potential effects of cross-talk inside WPPs
    and/or between WPPs and CPPs. Previous (Lebeda et al. 2008a) and more recent study
    (Fig. 1) clearly demonstrates that these interactions are very complex and can
    substantially contribute to gene flow, migration, host jumping and epidemiological
    interactions that could destabilize CPPs. Nevertheless, until recently our knowledge
    of this phenomenon has been limited. Currently, we have also an unprecedented
    rate of biological invasions (Alexander 2010), connected with climate change (Burdon
    and Zhan 2020; Jeger 2022; Zhan et al. 2018), where both plants and pathogens
    are moving from their points of origin to other parts of the world (Burdon et
    al. 2016). Conclusions Understanding the complexity of interactions between plants
    and their pathogens has no end (Burdon 2019). Currently, the very different genetic,
    developmental and physical micro-environment of extensive monoculture crop production
    inevitably places a limitation on the extent to which disease control approaches
    garnered from WPPs can be applied to those sorts of crop systems. Similarly, technological
    advances in harvest and sorting technologies raise the possibility of growing
    mixed grain crops, for example barley and wheat, and sorting the grain during
    the harvesting process (Zhan et al. 2015). Both of these possibilities would re-introduce
    the advantages of either intra- or interspecific genetic diversity to extensive
    crop production. While these options are ones for the future, there are already
    very many areas of agriculture in which disease control strategies derived from
    WPPs can, or already are, being sensibly deployed. Indeed, any agriculture in
    which more personal approaches are being used—c.f. the upsurge in interest in
    local production, low food miles, local producers supplying farmer''s markets—all
    can (or already) benefit from the advances of mixed row cropping that brings a
    variety of pest suppressing benefits (such as volatile chemicals released through
    the triggering of induced resistance), reductions in foliar diseases, and their
    infectivity complexity and other below-ground benefits (Yang et al. 2019). Finally,
    research of WPPs represents a very broad, vibrant, and fast developing area of
    plant biology, phytopathology, and evolutionary biology that has been neglected
    for a long time (Lebeda and Burdon 2013b), but can yield many new exciting ideas,
    theories, principles and knowledge, which can substantially contribute to the
    complex understanding of host–pathogen associations on all levels of biological
    and ecological hierarchy, and their application in a more nature-based agriculture.

  key_findings: '1. Bremia lactucae is common in wild Lactuca serriola populations
    in the Czech Republic, but disease incidence and severity are generally low, with
    no boom-and-bust cycles observed.

    2. There is significant variation in the expression of macroscopic symptom response
    on naturally infected L. serriola leaves, reflecting differences in host resistance
    and environmental factors.

    3. Bremia lactucae isolates from wild L. serriola and cultivated lettuce exhibit
    combined v-phenotype structures, suggesting the potential for gene flow between
    the pathosystems.

    4. The close proximity of wild and cultivated lettuce pathosystems favors the
    possibility of gene flow and pathogen spillover, highlighting the importance of
    considering both systems in disease management strategies.'
  limitations: 'Limited scope, as the study focuses on a specific pathosystem (Lactuca
    spp.-Bremia lactucae). Methodological issues, as the study relies on phenotypic
    characterization of pathogens using infectivity patterns and v-phenotypes, which
    may not capture all aspects of pathogenicity and genetic diversity.

    Dated information, as the study was conducted over a decade ago, and more recent
    research may have emerged since then. Incomplete epidemiological data, as the
    study does not provide detailed information on disease incidence, severity, and
    spread across the different pathosystems.'

  description: Urban agriculture systems can significantly contribute towards mitigating
    the impacts of inefficient and complex food supply chains and increase urban food
    sovereignty. Moreover, improving these urban agriculture systems in terms of nutrient
    management can lead to a better environmental performance. Based on a rooftop
    greenhouse in the Barcelona region, we propose a cascade system where the leachates
    of a tomato cycle from January to July (donor crop) are used as the main irrigation
    source for five successive lettuce cycles (receiving crop). By determining the
    agronomic performance and the nutrient metabolism of the system, we aimed to define
    the potential of these systems to avoid nutrient depletion and mitigate eutrophication,
    while scaling the system in terms of nutrient supply between the donor and the
    receiving crops. The results showed that low yields (below 130 g per lettuce plant)
    are obtained if a cascade system is used during the early stage of the donor crop,
    as the amount of nutrients in donor’s leachates, specially N (62.4 mg irrigated
    per plant in the first cycle), was not enough to feed the lettuce receiving crop.
    This effect was also observed in the nutrient content of the lettuce, which increased
    with every test until equaling the control (4.4% of N content) as the leachates
    got richer, although too high electrical conductivity values (near 3 dS/m) were
    reached at the end of the donor crop cycle. Findings on the uptake of the residual
    nutrient flows showed how the cascade system was able to take advantage of the
    nutrients to produce local lettuce while mitigating the effect of N and P in the
    freshwater and marine environments. Considering our case study, we finally quantified
    the scale between the donor and receiving crops and proposed three major ideas
    to optimize the nutrient flows while maintaining the yield and quality of the
    vegetables produced in the receiving crop.

    as the main irrigation source for five successive lettuce cycles (receiving crop).
    By determining the agronomic performance and the nutrient metabolism of the system,
    we aimed to define the potential of these systems to avoid nutrient depletion
    and mitigate eutrophication, while scaling the system in terms of nutrient supply
    between the donor and the receiving crops. The results showed that low yields
    (below 130 g per lettuce plant) are obtained if a cascade system is used during
    the early stage of the donor crop, as the amount of nutrients in donor’s leachates,
    specially N (62.4 mg irrigated per plant in the first cycle), was not enough to
    feed the lettuce receiving crop. This effect was also observed in the nutrient
    content of the lettuce, which increased with every test until equaling the control
    (4.4% of N content) as the leachates got richer, although too high electrical
    conductivity values (near 3 dS/m) were reached at the end of the donor crop cycle.
    Findings on the uptake of the residual nutrient flows showed how the cascade system
    was able to take advantage of the nutrients to produce local lettuce while mitigating
    the effect of N and P in the freshwater and marine environments. Considering our
    case study, we finally quantified the scale between the donor and receiving crops
    and proposed three major ideas to optimize the nutrient flows while maintaining
    the yield and quality of the vegetables produced in the receiving crop. Introduction
    Cities cover 3% of the Earth’s surface area, but host 55% of the world’s population
    (United Nations, 2014; SEDAC, 2016). The global nutritional demand thus concentrates
    in urban areas, resulting in long and complex supply chains. Urban agriculture
    (UA) has arisen as a promising solution that brings production closer to consumption
    points. However, UA is not free of environmental impacts. Similar to conventional
    agricultural systems, nutrient discharge resulting from intensive fertilizer use
    is particularly problematic due its impact on water eutrophication (Muñoz et al.,
    2008; Torrellas et al., 2012; Romero-Gámez et al., 2014, 2012; Boneta et al.,
    2019). The application of circular economy strategies in UA systems could help
    mitigate these impacts. Closing the nutrient cycles in soilless systems maintains
    the utility and value of scarce resources (Bocken et al., 2017), produces a regenerative
    effect on the environment (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey Center for
    Business and Environment, 2015), and contributes to a reduction in water and fertilizer
    consumption (Carmassi et al., 2005; Rufí-Salís et al., 2020). Two main strategies
    can be found in the literature to close the nutrient cycles in soilless systems.
    First, recirculation systems use drained water and nutrients in the same crop.
    This setup helps to reduce water and nutrient losses by closing resource flows
    (Ahmed et al., 2000; Agung Putra and Yuliando, 2015). However, it demands additional
    infrastructure, which requires high investment costs (De Pascale and Maggio, 2005;
    García-Caparrós et al., 2018) and increases the environmental impacts of the system
    (Rufí-Salís et al., 2020). Moreover, the high salinity of the drained water can
    cause yield reduction if it is directly recirculated to the crop without treatment
    or partial discharge (Magán et al., 2008; Grewal et al., 2011). Second, cascade
    systems use drained water and nutrients to irrigate another crop (Incrocci et
    al., 2003). Since nutrients tend to reach high concentrations in the leachates
    and thus increase the salinity of this water flow, the salt tolerance of the receiving
    crop has been the main field of inquiry in the literature. For instance, Shannon
    et al. (2000) analyzed the salt tolerance of nine leafy vegetables using salty
    water to simulate drainage water, finding that swiss chard was the most salt tolerant
    among those evaluated. With a similar method, Grieve and Suarez (1997) focused
    on potential sulfate and selenium toxicity, concluding that purslane (Portulaca
    oleracea) is an excellent candidate for saline drainage water reuse systems. Real
    case studies with cascade systems were analyzed by Muñoz et al. (2017), who assessed
    the performance of beef tomato in a greenhouse as the donor crop and a sequence
    of lettuce, tomato, and endive as receiving crops. This study underlined the need
    to further study the observed yield decrease and its causes. Incrocci et al. (2003)
    assessed a cascade cropping system using tomato as the donor crop and cherry tomato
    as the receiving crop, highlighting the potential of cascade set-ups to increase
    the water use efficiency of the system. Nonetheless, little is known about the
    potential of a cascade system to diminish the nutrient load of drainage flows.
    García-Caparrós et al. (2016) explored this potential with a pot experiment using
    ornamental Juncus acutus. The authors found that the species used presented a
    good bioremediation potential based on the uptake of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
    (P). García-Caparrós et al. (2018) also explored this potential using horticultural
    melon as the donor crop and ornamental rosemary as the receiving crop, finding
    a decrease in yield in the receiving crop, but also a great potential to optimize
    the water flows and remove the nitrates of the drained water. To our knowledge,
    there are no references in the literature exploring the potential of horticultural
    species (both as donor and receiving crops) to produce vegetables while mitigating
    nutrient depletion through the use of a cascade system and the quantification
    of the nutrient flows. The present article aims to tap the full potential of cascade
    systems to produce local-grown vegetables in the framework of UA while diminishing
    the nutrient load by closing nutrient cycles in the framework of urban metabolism.
    Based on the agronomic and nutritional performance of five successive receiving
    crops of lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Maravilla) irrigated by a long-cycle donor crop
    of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Arawak), we determined the feasibility and
    nutritional implications of cascade systems and provide recommendations to further
    improve the performance of this setup. This will enable a better implementation
    of UA systems in cities and inform decision-makers about the main benefits and
    improvement potential of reusing nutrients in UA by considering the principles
    of a circular economy. Materials and Methods System Under Study, Crop Description,
    and Experimental Design The study was performed in a rooftop greenhouse (RTG)
    located on the ICTA-ICP building (41.497681N, 2.108834E) on the campus of the
    Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 15 km west of Barcelona, in the West Mediterranean
    region of the Iberian Peninsula. The crops grown in the greenhouse used rainwater
    harvested from a roof surface of 400 m2 (plus 500 m2 from the neighboring building).
    The irrigation system was hydroponic, where the substrate bags are filled with
    perlite with a pH of 7, an electrical conductivity of 0.09 dS⋅m–1, and a granulometry
    of [0–6]. The RTG section used for the donor tomato crop was southeasterly facing
    and occupied an area of 84.3 m2. 57 substrate bags were used (40L), planting 3
    seedlings per bag, totaling 171 plants. The tomato crop was planted on January
    14th and uprooted on August 2nd, 2019. The average concentration of fertilizers
    in kg/m3 was KPO4H2 – 0.283, KNO3 – 0.138, K2SO4 – 0.367, Ca(NO3)2 – 0.533, CaCl2
    H2O – 0.133, Mg(NO3)2 – 0.178, Hortilon – 0.011, and Sequestrene – 0.011, although
    the nutrient solution was adapted based on the evolution and phenological stages
    of the tomato crop. The leachates of the tomato crop were collected through connected
    pipes from leachate trays and transported to a 300-L tank using a submergible
    pump. To maximize the nutrient recycling, these leachates were used to irrigate
    two crops. First, the same tomato crop using a recirculation system (totaling
    7.5 m3), whose performance was left out of the study to focus only on the cascade
    system. Second, a receiving lettuce crop located in another section of the RTG
    southwesterly facing using 2 L/h drippers (totaling 8.8 m3). Figure 1 shows the
    diagram of the water flows of the system. figure 1 Figure 1. Diagram of the cascade
    system. Five successive lettuce cycles were grown as shown in Table 1. The choice
    of lettuce was based on the lower nutritional demand from this crop compared to
    tomato. Low nutrient concentrations were expected in the leachates of the tomato
    crop, and thus lettuce can potentially produce competitive yields with the nutrients
    supplied through the cascade system. Average temperatures and relative humidity
    per test are shown in Supplementary Figures S1, S2, respectively. table 1 Table
    1. Number of plants and calendar of tests undergone in the present study. Plants
    were distributed in 4 substrate trays, with 8 perlite bags each using a 4 × 2
    organization and with a 1.2-m separation between trays. Each substrate bag can
    allocate 4 plants, totaling 32 plants per tray. All campaigns were planted from
    nursery plants. Besides campaigns three to five of the cascade system, we planted
    mirror control crops using the same species and variety to compare the results
    in terms of yield and nutrient content during the seasonal period with expected
    higher water demand and salinity. We used 2 substrate trays for the control, totaling
    64 plants. Water and Nutrient Monitoring To assess the water flows in the cascade
    system, analogic flow meters were coupled to the water system. Samples of the
    irrigation in the receiving crop and the control were collected directly from
    the drippers placed in the perlite bags. To determine the concentration in the
    water flows, the respective samples were collected three times per week and analyzed
    using ion chromatography (ICS-1000 and AS-DV by Dionex) to obtain concentration
    results for the anions nitrite (NO2–) and nitrate (NO32–). The same samples were
    externally analyzed using ICP-OES atomic spectroscopy (Optima 4300DV by Perkin-Elmer)
    to obtain results for P, potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sulfur
    (S). Nutrient content in the lettuce was determined based on three plants randomly
    selected at the end of the harvest. Samples were sorted into envelopes and dried
    in a furnace at 65°C for 1 week before analyzing externally the concentration
    of P, K, Ca, Mg, and S via ICP-OES atomic spectroscopy (Optima 4300 DV by Perkin
    Elmer) and the concentration of N with elemental analysis (Flash EA 2000 CHNS
    by Thermo Fisher Scientific). Since the sample for every test and treatment is
    3 random plants analyzed twice, a formal statistical analysis was not performed
    due to the low sample size. To calculate the accumulated irrigated nutrients per
    test, the concentration values obtained through the continuous analysis of the
    water samples for each nutrient were multiplied by the amount of water irrigated
    between the date a specific sample was taken and the date of the previous sample.
    The values obtained were then aggregated to obtain the final accumulated irrigated
    nutrients per test, and divided by the number of plants in a specific test to
    obtain this parameter per plant. Statistical Methods A set of statistical methods
    and tests were used to verify and strengthen the results obtained in different
    sections. The tests were performed through the use of different packages developed
    for R programming software, considering a statistical significance when p-values
    were less than 0.05. Shapiro Wilk’s test (Shapiro and Wilk, 1965) was used as
    the method to analyze the normality of observations or residuals obtained through
    linear regressions. Levene’s test (Levene, 1961) was used as the method to analyze
    the homogeneity of variances. Levene’s test is an alternative to Bartlett’s test
    with less sensitivity to non-normal data. If the two previous tests (Shapiro-Wilk’s
    and Levene’s) presented p > 0.05, we applied an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
    to the linear regression to evaluate if the means of a dependent variable were
    equal under different levels of an independent variable. Oppositely, we applied
    Kruskal-Wallis test (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) as the non-parametric analog of
    ANCOVA, recommended with non-normal distributions and inequality of variances
    (Feir-Walsh and Toothaker, 1974) to check if samples came from the same distribution.
    Three different methods were used to compare the statistical significance between
    slopes of a linear regression. The first one was based on Meseguer-Lloret (2017b)
    for homogeneous variances and Meseguer-Lloret (2017a) for non-homogeneous variances,
    and is based on a t-test. This method requires a prior test for normality. If
    a normal distribution is observed, a F-test can be performed to determine if the
    variances between treatments were homogeneous, since it is accurate only for normal
    data. However previous research concluded that the t-test is highly robust for
    equal sample size (Welch, 1938; Milton and Tsokos, 1983), which is the case for
    most data in this study. Based on the method described by Meseguer-Lloret (2017a)
    for non-homogeneous variances, a t-test should be performed by calculating tcalc
    as expressed in Eq. 1 and t’calc as expressed in Eqs 2–4, being “b” the value
    of the slope, “s2” the variance, and “t” the specific value in the t-table of
    probabilities. t c ⁢ a ⁢ l ⁢ c = | b 1 - b 2 | s b 1 2 + s b 2 2 ( 1 ) t c ⁢ a
    ⁢ l ⁢ c ′ = t 1 ⋅ s b 1 2 + t 2 ⋅ s b 2 2 s b 1 2 + s b 2 2 ( 2 ) t 1 = t 95 %
    n 1 - 2 ( 3 ) t 2 = t 95 % n 2 - 2 ( 4 ) If tcalc > t’calc, the slopes analyzed
    are statistically different. On the other hand, based on the method described
    by Meseguer-Lloret (2017b) for homogeneous variances, a t-test should be performed
    to calculate tcalc as expressed in Eq. 1 and ttab, which is the value in the t-table
    with a 95% of probability and “n1 + n2 -2” degrees of freedom, as expressed in
    Eq. 5. t t ⁢ a ⁢ b ⁢ 95 % = t 95 % n 2 - 2 ( 5 ) If tcalc > ttab, the slopes analyzed
    are statistically different. Oppositely, the slopes analyzed are statistically
    similar if tcalc < ttab. The second method is based on Andrade and Estévez-Pérez
    (2014). Although the authors state that the t-test is a robust method to compare
    the statistical difference between slopes, they suggest the use of the ANCOVA
    as a simpler method. The third method consists on the analysis of the “Estimated
    Marginal Means Of Linear Trends” through the “emtrends” function from the “emmeans”
    R package (Lenth et al., 2020). As stated by Lenth et al. (2020), “emtrends is
    useful when a fitted model involves a numerical predictor interacting with another
    predictor.” Results and Discussion This section presents and discusses the results
    divided in different sections: see section “Production,” section “Water: Irrigation,”
    section “Water: EC and pH,” section “Water: Nutrient Content,” section “Biomass:
    Nutrient Content,” section “Decreasing Eutrophication Potential and Nutrient Depletion,
    and section “Scaling of the System.” Values in X ± Y form express average ± standard
    deviation. Production Figure 2 shows the average fresh weight per lettuce in every
    test. We can see that Tests 1 (February) and 3 (May), produced low and similar
    yields: 108.66 ± 26.85 and 109.82 ± 22.39 g/plant, respectively. Test 2 (April)
    produced slightly more yield with a higher variability of data (127.95 ± 34.60
    g/plant), while Test 4 (June) and Test 5 (July) exerted the highest yields, with
    220.31 ± 38.27 and 134.17 ± 34.84 g/plant, respectively. On the other hand, the
    control treatments in Test 3, 4, and 5 (254.91 ± 52.66, 232.49 ± 62.25, and 185.11
    ± 32.75 g/plant) always had more weight than its respective cascade crops. The
    low yields obtained in the receiving crop in the cascade system coincide with
    the findings by Muñoz et al. (2012), who used tomato as both donor and receiving
    crop and Muñoz et al. (2017), who used tomato as donor crop and lettuce as receiving
    crop. figure 2 Figure 2. Production of the different tests. We determined that
    only cascade’s Test 1 (p = 0.78) and 4 (p = 0.26) and control’s Test 5 (p = 0.83)
    presented a normal distribution (p > 0.05). However, a normal distribution was
    observed when the test was done including all the control data (p = 0.22), but
    not when analyzing the entire cascade dataset (p < 0.05). Both of these results
    were expected based on the homogenous irrigation in the control and the foreseeable
    variability in nutrient content of the leachates of the donor crop, analyzed in-depth
    in section “Water: Nutrient Content”. When normality is studied for the residuals
    obtained through multiple combinations between tests and treatments, a non-normal
    distribution is observed in all of them (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the biggest
    differences between treatments were found in Test 3 and Test 5, in which the control
    produced 132 and 37% more yield, respectively, than their simultaneous cascade
    tests. Oppositely, the differences between treatments in Test 4 were narrowed
    to 6%. Despite this big variability, none of the comparisons between treatments
    (i.e., Control vs. Cascade in Test 3, 4, and 5) presented a significant homogeneity
    of variances (p < 0.05). Based on the non-normality detected, we applied Kruskal-Wallis
    test to compare between treatments. As expected, the results showed that the distribution
    differences between cascade and control were significant in every test (p < 0.05).
    Water: Irrigation All water irrigated to the receiving crop (8.8 m3) was supplied
    through the leachates of the donor crop, thus being a residual flow that the lettuce
    crop is taking benefit from and avoiding the use of new water. Irrigation was
    increased in every successive crop based on the climatic conditions inside the
    greenhouse, irrigating 5 times more water in Test 5 than in Test 1 (Figure 3).
    The slope of the linear regression in Test 1 and 2 of the cascade treatment was
    similar (0.22 and 0.23 with R2 of 0.96 and 1.00, respectively). This minimum difference
    was expected considering the temperatures reached inside the greenhouse during
    Test 1 and 2 periods, which were really similar (Supplementary Figure S1). We
    observed an anomaly in the water irrigated between the cascade system and the
    control in Test 3. Control Test 3 irrigated 20.30 L/plant with a slope of 0.60
    (R2 = 1.00), doubling the slope of cascade Test 3 (0.24 with R2 = 0.99), that
    irrigated 9.60 L/plant. The statistical differences between the slopes obtained
    in the different tests and treatments were determined through a multi-step method
    with a final t-test. First, we determined if the individual accumulated irrigation
    per plant, test and treatment followed a normal distribution, which was confirmed
    for all of them (p > 0.05). A normal distribution was also confirmed for the residuals
    (p > 0.05). In the next step, the variances between treatments were labeled as
    non-homogeneous in Test 3 (p < 0.05) and homogeneous in Test 4 and 5 (p > 0.05).
    Considering the non-homogenous variances in Test 3 we calculated tcalc and t’calc,
    obtaining the values 25.85 and 2.22, respectively. Considering that tcalc > t’calc,
    we concluded that the slopes between cascade and control in Test 3 were statistically
    different. On the other hand, we performed a t-test for homogeneous variances
    for Test 4 and 5. ttab values for Test 4 and 5 were both 1.71. tcalc for Test
    4 was 6.38, while a value of 0.14 was obtained for Test 5. Given that tcalc >
    ttab for Test 4, the slopes between treatments in this test were observed to be
    statistically different. Oppositely, the slopes between treatments in Test 5 were
    statistically similar since tcalc < ttab. figure 3 Figure 3. Irrigation per plant
    of the different tests. The ANCOVA applied to the data in Figure 3 strengthened
    the statistical results obtained in the t-test since the same conclusions were
    obtained: differences between slopes in Test 3 and 4 were found to be statistically
    different, while in Test 5 were observed to be statistically similar. To double-verify
    the statistical conclusions, we analyzed the “Estimated Marginal Means Of Linear
    Trends.” The outcome of the analysis was the same as the one obtained through
    the t-test and ANCOVA: statistically differences between slopes in Test 3 and
    4 (p < 0.05) and statistically similar slopes for Test 5 (p = 0.89) between cascade
    and control treatments. The difference in irrigation rate in Test 3 was related
    to a shortening in the amount of leachates generated by the tomato crop, coupled
    with the parallel irrigation with leachates in the donor crop. To solve this problem,
    three options were considered. First, to increase the irrigation in the donor
    crop, thus leaching more water that would be available for the receiving crop.
    This option was discarded because increasing the irrigation water use efficiency
    (assumed to be the volume of irrigated water applied per unit of yield) of the
    receiving crop while decreasing this parameter for the donor crop seemed contradictory.
    Moreover, the composition of the leachates will likely vary if more water is used
    in the donor crop. Second, to add water to the cascade system to meet the demand
    of the receiving crop. This option was also discarded because it would imply a
    modification in the composition of the irrigation of the receiving crop, thus
    blurring the effect of a cascade system. More important, both of these strategies
    were contradictory with the general aim of cascade systems: to take advantage
    of the residual flows of water and nutrients. If changes in the predefined system
    are needed, the value of the implementation of cascade systems decrease drastically.
    What could be seen as the best strategy is based on the practitioner or farmer
    priorities. When there is shortage of water, the farmer should prioritize in which
    system the residual flows are used. With a cascade set-up, the receiving crop
    can be prioritized during water shortage periods, minimizing the recirculation
    of water in the donor crop itself. However, if the donor crop is already not recirculating
    its own water and there is still water shortage, the first and second options
    outlined in this section can be applied considering the mentioned limitations.
    The differences between treatments in Test 4 and 5 were narrower than the ones
    observed in Test 3 since there were not episodes of water shortening. Control
    Test 4 presented a slope of 0.82 (R2 = 0.99), 18% higher than the slope for cascade
    Test 4 (0.69; R2 = 1.00). Slope for Test 5 was the same for both treatments (0.81;
    R2 = 0.99). Water: EC and pH Figure 4 shows the electrical conductivity (EC) values
    for the entire period under study. Since the control irrigation was manually controlled
    through the addition of fertilizers based on crop requirements, the EC values
    showed a great stability. On the other hand, the EC of the water used to irrigate
    the cascade crops increased over time, as the leachates of the tomato crop got
    richer in nutrients. The highest value was reached in the final cascade cycle,
    with 2.78 dS/m, much higher than the irrigation of the control (1.46 dS/m). Abou-Hadid
    et al. (1996) states that the perfect EC value for growing lettuce falls within
    the 1.0–1.5 dS/m range. Other literature specific for hydroponic lettuce mention
    that slightly higher values (1.2–1.8 dS/m) could be beneficial (Singh and Dunn,
    2016). Most experiments found in the literature report greater yields within these
    values (Serio and Elia, 2001; Miceli et al., 2003; Samarakoon et al., 2019). Among
    the cascade test performed in our study, Test 1 (0.92 dS/m), Test 2 (1.25 dS/m)
    and Test 3 (1.68 dS/m) fell within the optimal range reported by Singh and Dunn
    (2016) (Figure 4 – highlighted area). EC readings for drainage water in cascade
    systems are higher than the ones observed in Figure 1, such as 3.62 dS/m reported
    by García-Caparrós et al. (2016) in drained water of Ruscus aculeatus. The authors
    also reported that a dilution 1:2 with fresh water was able to decrease the EC
    to values <3 dS/m. In this sense, to compensate the high EC reached in the final
    cascade cycle, we added fresh water in the leachates, thus triggering the unstable
    values observed in Figure 3 for Test 5. However, EC values obtained in the present
    study weren’t as unsuitable as expected considering the focus on salt tolerance
    from the literature around cascade systems. Oppositely to EC, pH values decreased
    overtime for the cascade cycle, as shown in Supplementary Figure S3. A pH optimal
    range to grow hydroponic lettuce of 6.0–7.0 is reported by Singh and Dunn (2016),
    and of 5.6–6.0 by Brechner and Both (2013). Considering a broad range, all cascade
    tests presented optimal pH mean values except Test 1, that had a mean pH value
    slightly higher than 7. figure 4 Figure 4. Electrical conductivity (EC). Highlighted
    area represents the suitable EC range to grow hydroponic lettuce stated by Singh
    and Dunn (2016). Water: Nutrient Content Figure 5 shows the accumulated irrigated
    nutrients per plant per test. As expected, the nutrients irrigated in the cascade
    treatment increased over time, coinciding with the amount of nutrients leached
    by the tomato crop. K was the nutrient with the highest quantities in the cascade
    irrigation (reaching 10.7 g/plant in Test 5 of the cascade system), followed by
    Ca and N, reaching 5.0 and 3.6 g/plant in Test 5, respectively. On the other hand,
    nutrients irrigated in the control treatment presented a similar behavior among
    tests. figure 5 Figure 5. Accumulated irrigated nutrients per plant per test.
    Although the linear regressions observed in section “Water: Irrigation” regarding
    the irrigated water presented R2 values around 0.99, the evolution of the accumulated
    irrigated nutrients per plant (Figure 5) could also be affected by the concentration
    of nutrients in the water flows. As expected, the nutrient in the control irrigation
    followed a completely linear regression in all nutrients (R2 ≈ 0.99) since the
    nutrient solution supplied to the crop is completely homogenous. On the other
    hand, the linear regression of the accumulated irrigated nutrients in the cascade
    treatment highly fitted with the observations, with R2 values higher than 0.97.
    The only exception was N in Test 4, which presented a R2 = 0.85. The reason behind
    this behavior was the low quantities of this nutrient available through the leachates
    of the donor crop in Tests 1, 2, and 3. In this sense, we can see that this N
    limitation is overcome in the middle of Test 4 (concentration jumps from 35 to
    111 mg/L), probably related to a N increase in the nutrient solution supplied
    to the donor crop. In this sense, the nutrient supply to the donor crop and its
    stability can be highlighted as a relevant parameter to also stabilize the nutrient
    content of the leachates and thus, provide a balanced and reliable source of nutrients
    to the receiving crop in a cascade system. The slope of the accumulated irrigated
    nutrient per plant per test was compared between treatments for every specific
    nutrient through ANCOVA (Andrade and Estévez-Pérez, 2014). A prior step was done
    to assess the normality of the residuals, confirming the normality for all nutrients
    and tests apart from N in Test 3 with a p < 0.05. An analysis to determine the
    homogeneity of variances was applied to all combinations of nutrients and tests.
    As expected, Test 3 for N also presented statistically different variances (p
    < 0.05). Nonetheless, other cases were detected: P, K Ca and Mg for Test 3, S
    for Test 4 and K, Mg and S for Test 5. In this sense, ANCOVA was applied to the
    remaining cases with normal distribution and homogeneity of variances: Test 3
    for S, Test 4 for N, P, K, Ca and Mg and Test 5 for N, P, and Ca, observing statistically
    different slopes between treatments in all of them (p < 0.05). The same outcome
    was obtained when analyzing the “Estimated Marginal Means Of Linear Trends” for
    these cases, although one exception was detected. P in Test 4 presented statistical
    different slopes through ANCOVA (p < 0.05), but statistical similarity was observed
    through “emtrends.” Biomass: Nutrient Content Figure 6 shows the nutrient content
    in the lettuce for cascade and control tests. Every nutrient had a different behavior
    among tests, especially in the cascade treatment. N increased over time, especially
    between the 2nd and the 3rd test, and the 3rd and the 4th test. The 5th test presented
    the highest concentration of this nutrient. This tendency was expected based on
    the findings of the previous section, where we observed the increasing concentration
    of N in the leachates of the donor crop. Although the tendency related to the
    concentration in the water flow was observed for most nutrients, the 5th test
    was not the one with the highest nutrient content in the biomass for other nutrients
    analyzed. The 4th test was the one with the highest concentrations for P, K, Mg,
    and S with 0.97, 11.43, 0.34, and 0.35%, respectively. For Ca, the concentration
    in the 1st test was higher than the one observed for the 4th test (1.65%), which
    doesn’t correlate with its supply through the cascade system (Figure 5), and neither
    with the concentration of Ca in the leachates flow from the donor crop, which
    increased overtime. This high absorption of Ca in the first test neither correlates
    with traditional compatibilities/incompatibilities between nutrients (Mulder,
    1956), since absorption of Ca may be depressed by excessive amount of Mg, which
    was also highly absorbed in Test 1, or favored with excessive nitrate concentrations,
    which was limitedly supplied through the cascade system in the first tests. figure
    6 Figure 6. Nutrient context per plant (%). As expected, the control presented
    less differences between tests, especially for N. Due to differences in irrigated
    water between the cascade and the control in Test 3, nutrient content in the control
    was higher than in the cascade treatment for this test for all nutrients. When
    the irrigated water differences between the control and the cascade tests was
    normalized again in Tests 4 and 5, differences between treatments decreased. The
    average N content for the control (4.4%) was really similar to the one presented
    in tests 4 and 5 of the cascade system (4.4%). We could also find really similar
    concentrations between treatments in Test 4 for K (≈11.02%) and S (≈0.35%), and
    in Test 5 for P (≈0.78%), K (≈9.9%) and Ca (≈1.3%). Decreasing Eutrophication
    Potential and Nutrient Depletion Table 2 shows the amount of nutrients that were
    taken up by the lettuce plants (Supplementary Table S1) with respect to the irrigated
    through the cascade system (Supplementary Table S2). Supplementary Table S3 shows
    the amount of nutrients leached by the lettuce plants. The ratio between nutrients
    taken up and irrigated decreased over time given the fact that the amount of nutrients
    being irrigated through the cascade system increased as the leachates from the
    tomato crop got richer. We can see that all N irrigated through the cascade system
    was taken up by the lettuce crop in tests 1 and 2, with two major consequences.
    First, a possible nitrogen deficiency that made Test 1 the one with the lowest
    yield, making the cascade set-up inefficient in terms of production. Second and
    with a bioremediation perspective, the removal of all N from the residual flow
    used to irrigate the receiving crop triggered the complete mitigation of the marine
    eutrophication impacts caused by the leachates of the donor crop. This mitigation
    decreased over time, getting down to 43.1% of removal in Test 3, and being only
    6.5% in Test 5. The removal of P was already below one third in Test 1, thus just
    mitigating part of the freshwater eutrophication impacts. The removal rate of
    P got below 10% in Test 2, and it reached its lowest level in Test 5 with only
    1.9%. Given the non-renewable nature of P, the reuse of P is not only relevant
    to avoid freshwater eutrophication, but also in terms of mitigating its depletion.
    K was the nutrient irrigated with the most quantity through the cascade system
    (Figure 4). However, high removal rates were only reached in Test 1 (63.4%). Removal
    rate in Test 2 already got below 25% and kept decreasing over time. table 2 Table
    2. Uptake (%) of irrigated nutrient per plant in cascade treatments. Since the
    irrigation in the control was more controlled both in terms of water and nutrients,
    the removal rates among tests were more stable. This was specially the case of
    N, Ca, and Mg, while P slightly decreased in control tests 4 and 5, probably due
    to a combination of changes in the nutrient solution and an increase in P consumption
    of the donor crop in the production stage. Scaling the System Other studies that
    considered the use of a the leachates of a donor crop to irrigate horticultural
    products did not account for the variability of nutrients along the cycle of the
    donor crop. For example, Choi et al. (2011) first collected the waste nutrient
    solution from a hydroponic tomato crop and then applied it to a cabbage crop instead
    of connecting a donor and a receiving crop simultaneously in a cascade system.
    Therefore, the nutrient concentration supplied by the authors was stable, avoiding
    problems related to variability but still subjected to possible nutrient limitations.
    However, NO3– concentration in Choi et al. (2011) study (1285 mg/L) was always
    above all the NO3– values determined in our study. Considering the higher nutrient
    content of lettuce compared to cabbage (Weber, 2016), it is not surprising that
    Choi et al. (2011) obtained higher yields than the control. In a similar experiment,
    Zhang et al. (2006) also obtained higher yields using tomato leachates in muskmelon
    and cucumber. By using the same donor crop, Incrocci et al. (2003) irrigated a
    cherry tomato cycle. Since the focus of the author was on the effect of salinity,
    the waste nutrient solution was adjusted in terms of nutrient content to meet
    the same amount as the control: 161 mg/L of N. This concentration was lower than
    the one used by Choi et al. (2011). However, this value was not reached in the
    cascade system of the present study until Test 4, in which the yield differences
    between the control and the cascade plants was the narrowest (Figure 2). With
    a cascade set-up using tomato as both donor and receiving crops, Muñoz et al.
    (2012) converge with the present study since the authors observed yield reductions
    in the receiving crop compared to the control [as also found by Muñoz et al. (2017)],
    irrigated with N concentrations of 198 and 310 mg/L, respectively. The N concentration
    in the tomato leachates in Muñoz et al. (2012) (198 mg/L) is more than two times
    the average concentration leached by the tomato donor crop of the present study
    (72.5 mg/L). This probably indicates excessive N in the irrigation of the donor
    crop, which could be adjusted without yield reductions as suggested and quantified
    by the same authors. However, none of these authors considered the variability
    of nutrient content as a relevant parameter in cascade systems. Taking into account
    the need for a suitable dimensioning between donor and receiving crops in cascade
    systems to define best practices (Muñoz et al., 2017), we scaled the system in
    terms of nutritional demand of the receiving crop. To quantify the scaling between
    donor and receiving crops in the system under study, we considered the average
    uptake of the control for all nutrients [N (4.4%), P (0.84%), K (11.0%), Ca (1.4%),
    Mg (0.29%), and S (0.33%)] and the average yield of the control (224 ± 58 g/plant).
    Table 3 shows the quantity of lettuce that could be grown with the maximum quantity
    of nutrients that could be supplied through the cascade system, considering that
    all leachates of the donor crop are applied to the receiving crop through the
    cascade system. table 3 Table 3. Amount of lettuce that could be produced in the
    cascade system under analysis considering the application of all tomato leachates.
    As we can see in Table 3, the limiting nutrient was always N, allowing to grow
    a 1:10 and a 6:10 system for Test 1 and 2, respectively. P (9:10) and K (4:10)
    in Test 1 were the other nutrients with less than a 1:1 ratio between the tomato
    donor crop and the lettuce receiving crop. Considering N as the limiting nutrient,
    we can state that in our system with 171 tomato plants, we could grow 17 lettuce
    plants in Test 1, while being able to grow 1554 lettuce plants in Test 5, thus
    giving the practitioners three main options in terms of crop management, considering
    an ideal situation where we have an area that can allocate 1554 lettuce plants,
    which is the number of lettuces that we could grow in Test 5 considering the N
    content in the tomato leachates. First, to grow 17 lettuce plants in all tests.
    This option will ensure the production of the same amount of plants in every test
    but will present huge inefficiencies in terms of space (if the rest of the area
    is not occupied by other crops) and nutrient flows, discharging a great quantity
    of nutrients that will increase over time as the leachates of the donor crop become
    nutrient-richer. This nutrient inefficiency could be mitigated by applying recirculation
    in the donor crop itself. Second, to grow 17 (Test 1), 101 (Test 2), 286 (Test
    3), 1073 (Test 4), and 1554 (Test 5) lettuce plants connected to the cascade system,
    while growing 1537 (Test 1), 1453 (Test 2), 1268 (Test 3), and 481 (Test 4) lettuce
    plants irrigated using a conventional nutrient solution. With this option, yield
    would be maximized, while adapting the nutrient demand of the lettuce cycles to
    the nutrient supplied through the cascade system without requiring further nutrient
    management. Third and finally, start with 1554 lettuce plants connected to the
    cascade system. To avoid nutrient deficiencies as the ones observed in the present
    study, the nutrient content in the leachates tank used to irrigate the receiving
    crop must be adjusted. A specific amount of all nutrients should be added in Test
    1, while N, P and K should be added in Test 2 and 3, and only N should be added
    in Test 4. This option would be the most efficient to produce the same amount
    of lettuce over time while minimizing the nutrient input. However, it would require
    a detailed control of nutrient flows to avoid nutrient deficiencies. It is important
    to understand that, despite the strategies mentioned above, the list of management
    practices is endless: mix and store the leachates during Test 1 to increase the
    nutrient supply to Test 2 (and omit Test 1 of lettuce), increase the water irrigated
    to the donor crop, etc. However, the value of all possible strategies rely on
    their performance in real crops. Therefore, we highlight the need to evaluate
    and quantify the potential yield that could be reached through the application
    of these strategies. In addition, the analysis of the nutritional and water flows
    in pilot or full-scale experiments should be included in the list of upcoming
    challenges to verify that the plant nutrition is optimal and that the cascade
    system is well scaled to mitigate eutrophication impacts derived from the depletion
    of nutrients in the donor crop. Conclusion The present paper has presented an
    evaluation of a cascade system with a long-cycle tomato donor crop and five successive
    cycles of lettuce. The assessment of the agronomic performance and the nutrient
    flows have shed light on the potential of these systems to mitigate nutrient depletion
    in cities while producing food in the framework of urban agriculture. The variation
    of nutrient content of the leachates produced by the donor crop is a key parameter
    to plan the amount of plants that can be planted of the receiving crop. The early
    stage of the donor crop could only produce 0.1 lettuces per tomato plant, with
    N as the limiting nutrient. On the other hand, the late stage of the donor crop
    was able to leach enough nutrients to feed 9 lettuces per tomato plant. However,
    attention must be paid on the electrical conductivity of the water flow to stay
    within non-harmful values. Nevertheless, the cascade system was shown to be efficient
    to mitigate the nutrient discharge of open systems, especially in terms of N and
    P to avoid eutrophication impacts in the early stage of the tomato crop. To this
    end, a good scaling between the two crops of the system is vital to tap the full
    potential of the cascade set-up, while having different options in terms of system
    management. Given the findings of this study, we encourage future researchers
    to test different kind of horticultural crops. Considering the nutritional problems
    in the beginning of the cycle of the donor crop and the harmful salinity that
    can be reached at the end, further research should test possible combinations
    of donor and receiving crops that minimize these two problems. Reporting the limitations
    of these kind of systems is key to a transparent process of decision-making in
    the implementation of optimization strategies in urban agricultural systems. In
    terms of experimental design, further research assessing the nutritional flows
    of cascade systems should increase the number of plants that will be analyzed
    in terms of nutrients to precisely determine the variability of concentrations
    within the same treatment and test. Data Availability Statement The raw data supporting

  explanation: This paper explores the role of community-supported agriculture (CSA)
    in shaping food lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes. The authors conducted
    a narrative review of the literature to assess the evidence for CSA's impact on
    diet, physical activity, and overall well-being, finding that CSA participation
    is associated with increased fruit and vegetable consumption, healthier dietary
    patterns, and improved physical and mental health outcomes.
  extract_1: Individuals participating in CSA programs have been shown to have healthier
    dietary patterns compared to non-participants, with higher intakes of fruits,
    vegetables, and whole grains.
  extract_2: Several studies have also found that CSA participation is associated
    with increased physical activity levels, likely due to the increased availability
    of fresh produce and the opportunity for physical activity through gardening or
    farm work.

    Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Nature-based solutions have not been able
    to actively involve citizens and to address successfully food security, poverty
    alleviation, and inequality in urban areas. The Edible City approach promises
    a strategic step towards the development of sustainable, livable, and healthy
    cities. We introduce the conceptional framework of Edible City Solutions (ECS),
    including different forms of urban farming combined with closed loop systems for
    sustainable water, nutrient, and waste management. We review scientific evidence
    on ECS benefits for urban regeneration and describe the status quo of ECS in Rotterdam,
    Andernach, Oslo, Heidelberg, and Havana as case studies. We provide an analysis
    of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to explore the capacity
    of ECS to enhance multifunctionality of urban landscapes with special focus on
    social cohesion and quality of life. Based on this we identify and discuss strategies
    for fostering socially relevant implementations for the case study cities and
    beyond. Keywords: circular economy; living labs; multifunctionality; urban agriculture;
    urban farming; urban regeneration; social cohesion 1. Introduction The majority
    of humans are exposed to urban environmental conditions that often challenge human
    health and well-being and also threaten natural resources (e.g., [1,2]). The ongoing
    urbanisation decreases green space per capita and increases the need to counteract
    environmental injustice, criminality, and exclusion of vulnerable groups [3].
    Rising costs for maintenance of the overall urban infrastructure and for mitigation
    of climate change impose sustainable and innovative solutions to strengthen urban
    resilience (e.g., [4,5]). Hence, urban green infrastructure is being rethought
    as linking recreation areas and traditional nature-based solutions (NBS; see,
    e.g., [6,7,8]). NBS are originally defined as cost-effective solutions that are
    inspired and supported by nature and simultaneously provide environmental, social,
    and economic benefits and help building resilience [9]. Over the last decade,
    efforts to implement traditional NBS, such as parks, vegetation along urban roads,
    small and medium-scale green space on and around residential buildings, have been
    intensified and up-scaled. However, these NBS have not been able to significantly
    increase social cohesion as they mostly invite to ‘stay and use’ passively but
    not to become actively involved on-site, in an ongoing fashion. This gap needs
    to be closed to overcome the mismatch of traditional NBS and local citizens. Edible
    City Solutions (ECS) are going a step further by deepening the socio-cultural
    and socio-economic dimensions of NBS. The vision of productive urban landscapes
    (e.g., [10]) pledges a step towards the strategic development of sustainable,
    livable, and healthy cities. Urban food production use innovative principles of
    ecological design, closed material, and energy flows. The environmental benefits
    of ECS connected to closed water, as well as waste and nutrient loops are widely
    acknowledged (e.g., [11,12] on ECS; [13,14] on circular economy, [15]). Additionally,
    other NBS benefits, edible green spaces are socially inclusive, invite citizens
    to co-create the sustainable development of their society and proactively change
    urban environment to their benefit and, thus, induce a paradigm shift of urban
    lifestyle. Worldwide, Edible City projects have demonstrated emancipative citizen
    commitment and successful inclusive urban regeneration to a considerably greater
    extent than other NBS. Initiatives based on edible urban green space directly
    and lastingly involve citizens in social processes, ranging from co-design to
    co-implementation and long-term co-management of evolving edible green spaces.
    Existing Edible City Solutions (ECS) have created impressive benefits for local
    communities worldwide (a) to effectively overcome social problems by their inclusive
    and participatory dynamics, alleviating as co-benefit the financial burden of
    conventional measures regarding security, physical and mental health (b) to launch
    new green businesses and value chains, creating jobs, products, and services and
    thereby local economic growth in often disconnected or disadvantaged urban areas
    (see examples in Figure 1). Figure 1. Edible city pilots have demonstrated emancipative
    citizen commitment and successful inclusive urban regeneration worldwide (sources:
    Nabolagshager; Mundraub; Brighton & Hove Food Partnership; RotterZwam). Here we
    (i) introduce to the conceptual framework of Edible City Solutions (ECS), (ii)
    briefly review scientific evidence on ECS benefits for urban regeneration (iii)
    describe the status quo of ECS in five different cities (i.e., Rotterdam, Andernach,
    Oslo, Heidelberg, and Havana) as case studies and provide a SWOT analysis of ECS
    to explore the capacity of ECS to enhance multifunctionality of urban landscapes
    with special focus on social cohesion and quality of life. Based on this we (iv)
    identify and discuss strategies for fostering socially-relevant implementations
    in the cities. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Conceptual Framework of Edible City
    Solutions Edible City Solutions (ECS) focus on urban productive landscapes including
    the wide range of different forms of urban farming, building integrated farming,
    agro-forestry, aquaculture, biomass production for energy, among other productive
    and ornamental purposes and services combined with closed loop systems for sustainable
    water, nutrient, and waste management (Figure 2). Figure 2. Examples for nature-based
    ECS and benefits. Our ECS concept amplifies the benefits provided by nature-based
    solutions from supply of ecosystem services such as cooling, air, and water cleaning,
    habitat services, or recreation effects (e.g., [7,16]) towards provisioning services
    that address food security, poverty alleviation, and inequality in urban areas
    [12]. The elements of this ''Edible Green Infrastructure Concept'' includes edible
    urban forests, edible urban greening, different gardens and parks, school gardens,
    allotment gardens, community and domestic gardens, edible green roofs and vegetable
    rain gardens, edible green walls and facades, but not intensive urban agricultural
    practices. Our ECS concept includes also these practices managed in a sustainable
    way such as commercial indoor farming, high-yield commercial gardening, biomass
    feedstock, aquaculture, and livestock and new innovative cropping techniques in
    urban areas, such as hydroponics or ‘organoponics’ [11]. Commercial urban rooftops
    and vertical farming offer an untapped potential to systemically integrate farms
    into buildings [17,18] and drive economic resilience of cities. Beyond the effects
    on social integration and environmental sustainability ECS present opportunities
    for significant improvements to food supply, zero-km food, and local economy.
    Depending on the local situation of users and producers, ECS combined with closed
    loop technologies to close water, waste, and nutrient cycles fulfill diverse functions
    including food production and community building and are promising to contribute
    to reducing socio-economic and environmental problems. Examples of high technology
    ECS which demand a greater planning frame and require new technical standards
    are edible city trees, hydroponic glasshouses, tomato-fish loop roofs, or green
    walls for cooling installations. Low technology ECS are already spread all over
    the world, are user friendly, and driven by the will of being active and productive
    at the same time (e.g., espalier fruits, sit-and-eat fruit gardens, educational
    and school gardens, agro-biodiversity gardens as observatories, kitchen herb walls,
    or urban honeybee hotels). The mostly community built urban farming areas support
    the huge bunch of benefits and co-benefits for urban climate and quality of life
    of urban dwellers. 2.2. Literature Review on ECS Benefits for Urban Regeneration
    To review research on ECS benefits for urban regeneration, we screened articles
    in the Web of Science by using keywords covering the different Edible City Solutions
    (ECS; see Section 2.1; i.e., ‘urban farm*’ OR ‘urban garden*’ OR ‘building integrated
    farm*’ OR ‘urban agro-forestry’ OR ‘urban aquaculture’ OR ‘urban biomass production’
    OR ‘urban horticulture*’ OR ‘urban food production’ OR ‘edible cit*’) and keywords
    covering urban regeneration (adapted from [19]), i.e., ‘urban regeneration’ OR
    ‘environmental justice’ OR ‘social inclusion’ OR ‘equity’ OR ‘health’ OR ‘well-being’
    OR ‘revitalization’ OR ‘renewal’ OR ‘rehabilitation’ OR ‘urban development’).
    A keyword search (August 2018) in the Web of Science revealed > 3600 references
    in English related to different ECS and urban regeneration in the ‘‘topic’’ OR
    ‘‘title’’ fields since 2010, but only 20% of these were developed in social sciences,
    psychology, health or economics that mainly deal with the socio-economic dimension
    of urban regeneration. In a first step, we screened the titles and abstracts of
    the remaining articles and eliminated articles that are not related to our topic
    (144). Second, we eliminated articles without access to the full text version
    and unanswered requests of full text (3). Third, we made a full text review of
    the remaining articles to gather the relevant information. The whole process was
    conducted independently by three reviewers. Only 28 papers were identified that
    directly address ECS and urban regeneration. About one half of the studies focus
    on physical and mental health and well-being and the other half on sociology and
    education, there were only few studies on economic effects (e.g., [20]). We also
    included twenty other papers and grey literature found by cross-references in
    our research. Here, we highlight current evidence of ECS benefits for urban regeneration,
    but we do not aim on a complete screening of all existing literature, as social
    sciences often use publication modes that are not included in the database of
    Web of Science. 2.3. Case Studies for Status Quo Analysis of ECS and Strategy
    Development The five selected cities (Rotterdam, Andernach, Oslo, Heidelberg,
    and Havana) suffer from typical social challenges due to urbanization, including
    functional transformation and densification trends and provide a broad basis of
    NBS experience. The cities strictly highlight urgent urban challenges like inclusiveness,
    social cohesion, well-being, mental and physical health, safety, and criminality.
    We used a combination of descriptive and analytical research methods to explore
    the capacity of ECS to enhance multifunctionality of urban landscapes with special
    focus on social cohesion and quality of life in our case study cities and beyond.
    Status quo analysis is based on a systematic review of available documents of
    cities administrations and expert knowledge provided by the city representatives
    involved. The following aspects of the case study cities have been explored: amount
    of implemented ECS; governance and policy framework related to ECS, decision-makers
    and their objectives regarding ECS, barriers to ECS implementation, relevant awards
    for cities, and specific challenges. After a systematical review of published
    information and available grey literature about each case study city we analyzed
    the main contact persons in the cities and provided a questionnaire where we collected
    formal knowledge about: (i) Governance and strategies of social relevant issues;
    (ii) Management of green infrastructure and urban master plan concerning valorization
    of green infrastructure through edible solutions; (iii) policies and guidelines
    for fostering social and climatic resilience and the internal ranking of challenges
    in the city (i.e., inclusion, equitability, livability, beneficial social networks,
    and individual well-being) and (iv) we discussed the city’s visions on ECS implementation
    and collected first ideas on Living Labs to be defined in a further step of our
    research and action plan. We use the SWOT analysis to effectively explore the
    strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to address complex strategic
    situations [21]. Based on the SWOT results we develop general strategies for effective
    ECS implementation, which in turn will be adapted to the city-specific strategies
    to improve Edible City Concepts (Figure 3) for our case study cities. Here, we
    present results of Step I (Status quo, SWOT and city-specific visions for our
    case studies), discuss general strategies to improve Edible City Concepts and
    provide first drafts for Living Labs (Step IIa). Future research (Step IIb–Step
    IV, Figure 3) will co-create action plans and define Living Labs based on multi-stakeholder
    involvement. These living labs will be co-implemented at different scales, impacts
    on urban regeneration monitored to constantly evaluate effectiveness of implementation
    for optimization. This knowledge will provide in turn a wide range of experience
    to other cities that are developing master plans on ECS implementations for a
    worldwide growing network of Edible Cities. Figure 3. Methodological approach
    of implementation and mainstreaming of ECS. 3. Results 3.1. Scientific Evidence
    on ECS Benefits for Urban Regeneration In developing countries, urban horticulture
    is mainly a strategy for achieving food security, equitability, and inclusion.
    Urban gardeners generally have low incomes and need to cultivate vegetables for
    food supply and as a source of income [22,23]. The high potential of urban agriculture
    to respond to a rapidly emerging food demand has been demonstrated in Havana,
    Cuba [24]. However, food insecurity is also a phenomenon in developed countries
    and food-banks are increasingly used worldwide (e.g., [25,26,27]). As an example
    local governments from Northern Italy offered urban allotment gardens on public
    lands to encourage low income senior citizens to produce their own food, benefit
    health, and overcome loneliness by social interactions in the gardens [28]. ECS
    offer a strong contribution to improve urban livability, social and individual
    well-being in the developed countries as urban sprawl and loss of peri-urban agricultural
    land continues [20,29]. Sociologically, urban farming favors both social inclusion
    [30,31] and reduction of gender inequalities, as urban farmers are often women
    in both developing and developed countries [22,32]. The great demand for inclusive
    green spaces is directly linked to the city’s duty to assure environmental justice
    among residents, healthy and good urban quality of life and to provide social
    benefits and co-benefits in ecological and economical dimensions that contribute
    to a sustainable way of living [30,33,34]. However, research on how sustainable
    lifestyles can be shaped is widely lacking. A study in a french allotment garden
    on mechanisms of change towards sustainable lifestyles induced by governmental
    policies and related resistance to pro-environmental practices were not systematically
    related to shared concerns [35]. Three gardener types were identified: (i) few
    pro-environmental ‘wild life friendly’ gardener with coherent life style; (ii)
    numerous ‘Cultivating for pleasure’ gardeners, that implemented pro-environmental
    practices but not concerns and (iii) numerous ‘Clean and order-loving’ gardeners,
    that are respecting pro-environmental rules like other allotment norms [35]. Yet,
    pro-environmental policies have to address the value-action gap by diffusion of
    ecological concern to foster sustainable lifestyle changes. Urban quality of life
    as a hierarchical multi-attribute concept is defined and monitored by monetary
    (e.g., hedonic price, willingness-to-pay, cost-benefit, positional value), subjective
    (e.g., life satisfaction, subjective well-being, ranking/rating evaluation), and
    quantitative methods (see review [36]). ‘Willingness-to-pay’ valorizes the implementation
    of urban green spaces and is also related to the ‘will to invest’: the highest
    readiness to invest in green spaces was directed to the green space next to the
    doorstep [37]. A large body of literature demonstrated the overall ECS benefits
    for human health and individual well-being involving positive effects on air quality,
    physical activity, social cohesion, and overall stress reduction (e.g., [38,39,40,41]).
    There is a strong relation between mental and physical health of residents and
    reachable urban green space. Low accessibility to health promoting green space
    affects mainly low-income people, while well-off households in the same neighborhoods
    can remedy the lack of urban green services (e.g., by air conditioning or staying
    at country side residences on weekends or during vacations [42]. The main public
    concerns against food produced in urban landscapes are related to the high pollution
    loads in urban soil, water, and air (e.g., [43]). ECS provide important economic,
    social and cultural spaces where knowledge related to agricultural practices is
    transmitted and through which households may improve their income and livelihoods
    [44,45]. Since long, community gardens in low-income areas integrate successfully
    diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds [46,47]. Thus, integration or
    intercultural urban gardens aim to dismantle social and cultural boundaries by
    gardening and space-making practices (e.g., [48]). The main beneficiaries of ecosystem
    services from Barcelona’s urban gardens are elderly, low-middle income, and migrant
    people [47]. Furthermore, urban gardening and grassroot-based revitalization project
    have positive effects on the social cohesion of neighborhoods [33,42,49,50]. Crime
    and environment are strongly intertwined, environmental justice can reduce crime
    and security related costs [51]. Undesired effects of green gentrification are
    discussed and can be avoided by co-creation, and co-implementation with local
    communities [52,53]. Inclusive approach to re-nature cities encouraged planners
    to move away from re-wilding approaches to urban landscapes that can serve as
    nodes for urban agriculture and community garden spaces more connected to communities
    concerns about food security, job creation and human health [30,53]. School gardens
    can be used as an efficient policy tool to foster environmental and health education
    of future generations across different socio-economic groups and to create more
    environmental equity in urban areas (e.g., [54,55,56]). ‘Culinary gardening’ was
    valued as personal, social and gustatory pleasures by working-class students that
    radiate from the garden to whole school culture [57]. School gardens demonstrably
    helped to attenuate origin and class inequality as reason for poor achievement
    at school [56]. Beyond school gardens, other urban gardens support children''s
    biophilia as private gardens and yards are the most preferred space for nature
    experiences [58]. The implementation of ECS reduces the ecological footprint and
    food miles of cities. Thus, urban food production has already taken place for
    decades at the gate to a regenerative agriculture in the future [15]. The possibility
    of urban self-reliance in food is frequently questioned. Although urban faming
    is booming, there remains a large skepticism from, e.g., agricultural science
    and food producers to urban farming activities and its contributions to urban
    self-reliance in food [59]. Experiences of community-supported agriculture (CSA)
    today mainly located in the peri-urban areas of cities [60] can provide examples,
    how to successfully connect rural and urban farmers for mutual learning in order
    to enhance the ECS productivity. Grewal and Grewal [59] calculated, that post-industrial
    North American cities can reach significant levels of local self-reliance in food,
    but require an active role of city governments and planners, public commitment,
    financial investment, and labor and conclude that the overall benefits to local
    economy and community may outweigh the cost. 3.2. Status Quo of ECS in Case Study
    Cities and SWOT Analysis Rotterdam, Andernach, Oslo and Heidelberg provide a broad
    basis of ECS experience and face typical societal challenges in European cities.
    In addition, the case study of Havana as a pioneer of self-sufficient ECS, enables
    us to reflect beneficial experiences and facilitate mutual support and interconnections
    beyond Europe (see Table 1). Table 1. Status quo of ECS in case study cities are
    described by focusing on current governance and policy, decision makers and their
    objectives, identified barriers for ECS, awards on urban sustainability held by
    the cities, specific challenges identified by the city administrations to be addressed
    by ECS development. Rotterdam (Netherlands with 631,000 inhabitants and 1.2 million
    in its agglomeration) is the parade example of a multicultural city in Europe
    with all the challenges and opportunities that such diversity presents. The Dutch
    agriculture and food sector is the 2nd largest exporter in the world, and the
    1st in Europe accounting for 9% of the national GDP using one of the smallest
    carbon footprint (2014). This efficient, effective, and large production takes
    place at the gate of the city of Rotterdam already for decades. Nevertheless,
    within the city walls at a micro-scale, there is a green movement and initiatives
    going on like in many other cities worldwide. Rotterdam and its city administration,
    as a member of the ‘100 resilient cities’ network, already has experience with
    NBS in general but also with NBS-implementations anchored in the urban master
    plans. Rotterdam counts to date more than 200 nature-based Edible City Solution
    initiatives mainly grass-roots (Figure 4a). Most of ECS initiatives work with
    volunteers and often lack professional back-up and continuity in expertise transfer.
    All of them depend on (private) funds. When granted funds, they lack time, capacity
    and/or expertise to monitor and to show the funders the social benefits of their
    organizations. In addition, some initiatives may share the ambition of picking
    up commercial activities. Rotterdam aims at facilitating with the valorization
    of their ECS. Here, the main challenge is to guide these fragmented and often
    vulnerable ECS to a stable network of ECS. Moreover, Rotterdam aims at the integration,
    employment and education in a socio-cultural diverse society and will overcome
    the fragile availability of expertise and experience of the existing high potential
    ECS grass root movements. Thus, Rotterdam’s Living Lab will focus on an empowerment
    of ECS initiatives by fostering self-sustainment and on the development of a legal
    framework (Figure 4b). Figure 4. Status quo (a) and target transformation after
    implementation of co-planned Living Labs (b) in the case study Cities. The green
    symbols stand for different existing ECS (a) and illustrate the potential development
    to ECS with greater outreach (b). For details see text on case studies. In Andernach
    (Germany, 30,000 inhabitants) ECS were created in cooperation with the ‘Perspective
    GmbH’, a local institution for occupation and qualification of permanently unemployed
    people and refugees. The city aimed to form creative public green space, to support
    biodiversity and to save money on green space maintenance. Vegetables, culinary
    herbs or cut flowers turned green spaces into exciting areas for the citizens.
    Instead of ‘Keep off!’ one read ‘Feel free to pick!’. In 2014 the program to cultivate
    these ECS was carried out by six workers and one professional gardener. Maintenance
    costs significantly decreased by involving more citizens, students and elderly
    people. Andernach demonstrates cost-effectiveness of highly accepted green spaces
    (Figure 4a) and aim to extent ECS across the city. Accordingly, the aim of the
    Living Lab is to spread the existing beneficial social networks across the entire
    city population in order to provide access to healthy and fresh food especially
    for vulnerable groups in public kitchens, children’s homes and refugee camps (Figure
    4b). Oslo (Norway, 660,000 inhabitants; 1.2 million in its agglomeration) has
    a rapidly increasing population. The settlement is to a large degree segregated
    according to socioeconomic background, with a ‘rich’ west and a ‘poor’ east of
    the city. For a number of years Oslo has strengthened a network of actors in urban
    agriculture with a wide range of purposes, e.g., local food, education, social
    cohesion, inclusion, care, and therapy (Figure 4a). ECS are in line with a revised
    strategy on urban agriculture that will be launched now. Oslo offers a well-established
    project cooperation among the agricultural and environmental sectors in administration,
    SMEs, NGOs, and other stakeholders, including business associations (e.g., Norwegian
    farmer’s union). The main challenge of Oslo is to strengthen equitability at city
    scale, the Living Lab will empower local citizens to launch their own start-up
    and developing market distribution networks for ECS products to provide long-term
    employment and full-time jobs especially in those neighborhoods with high poverty
    and unemployment rates (Figure 4b). Heidelberg (Germany, 156,000 inhabitants)
    has the challenge to find new uses for more than 200 ha of abandoned land, which
    became vacant with the withdrawal of the US-Army in 2014. The city has already
    completed a feasibility study for this site looking at NBS and ECS (Figure 4a).
    The main challenge of Heidelberg is rent and price inflation, which has led to
    a severe shortage of affordable housing. The densification trend therefore needs
    to be stemmed by good quality open space and long-term affordable housing models.
    The city is holding an International Building Exhibition (IBA), which aims to
    build up ECS as showcases and lighthouse projects. The main challenge for the
    Living Lab of Heidelberg is the re-naturing and re-generation of an abandoned
    area at Heidelberg’s city border with combined low and high tech ECS implementations
    through connecting it to an agricultural park used by different stakeholders with
    different interests with open access for surrounding local citizens, Figure 4b).
    Havana (Cuba, 2.1 million inhabitants) is an exceptional example for urban agriculture
    on large scale. After the break of the soviet bloc Havana fell into the worst
    economic crises in history. Since 1994, a governmental strategy made Havana to
    one of the most successful examples of urban agriculture worldwide. More than
    half of the consumed food is grown organically on-site. This example shows how
    ECS can be mainstreamed in a city and provides up-scaling and feasibility knowledge,
    accompanied by huge experience on urban planning level and strategic implementation
    (Figure 4a). Urban farmers in Havana use predominately low-tech technologies and
    practices achieving yields of up to 20 kg/m2, 10-fold higher yields than commonly
    achieved in mixed stands small scale agriculture. Among the used technologies
    are drip irrigation, organoponics, regular addition of compost, and other good
    horticultural practices (e.g., the use of well-adapted varieties, mixed cropping,
    crop rotation, and integrated pest management). In the process, Havana has also
    become a pioneer in a worldwide transition to sustainable agriculture that produces
    ’more with less’. Havana’s Living Lab will improve the internal network along
    the urban food and agriculture value chain from agricultural space management,
    substrate production (e.g., lumbriculture), agro-biodiverse seedlings and seed
    production, organic horticulture and agroforestry, biodiversity friendly integrated
    pest management, food distribution, and overall enhanced management of infrastructure
    and resources. Moreover, Havana aims to innovate the use of water-saving technologies
    and rainwater harvesting and on the transfer of urban organic horticulture technologies
    to the global ECS market (Figure 4b). Based on the literature summarized in Section
    3.1 and on the in situ experiences of our case study cities (see questionnaire
    in Material and Methods), we explore the capacity of ECS to enhance multi-functionality
    of urban landscapes with special focus on social cohesion and quality of life.
    The SWOT analysis (Figure 5) clarifies the most important strengths, opportunities,
    weaknesses, and threats to implement ECS successfully for social inclusive urban
    regeneration. Figure 5. Results of SWOT analysis to explore the capacity of ECS
    to enhance multi-functionality of urban landscapes with special focus on social
    cohesion and quality of life. The connection between mental and physical health
    and reachable green infrastructure and NBS is evident in the literature. ECS provide
    an instrument for urban planning to achieve a balance in highly challenged cities
    of the 21st century. The contribution of green infrastructure and NBS to climatic
    resilience is emphasized and broadly accepted, what lacks is the evidence of the
    social impact of ECS as socially active NBS [6]. Most studies refer to NBS as
    derivate of green infrastructure and as meeting points that do not cause their
    users to interact or engage with NBS design and management. There are first evidences,
    that participation in community-supported agriculture (CSA) shape shareholder
    food lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes [61]. Thus, ECS can learn from CSA
    concerning citizen’s involvement and sustainable lifestyle changes. However, CSA
    members are typically women, white, highly educated, and motivated to participate
    in CSA by a concern for the environment and a desire for locally grown, high-quality,
    and organic products. ECS implementation in deprived and segregated neighborhoods
    (see the case study of Andernach, Figure 4) is more inclusive by addressing diverse
    and vulnerable groups such as migrants, refugees, or long-term unemployed people.
    To reach truly inclusive urban resilience, it is necessary to move out of conventional
    planning tools of urban green and NBS as green interventions, which invite to
    use but not encourage participation in planning, design or maintenance as concrete
    social interaction to foster social cohesion. ECS provide a holistic, multifunctional,
    and multi-stakeholder approach to tackle radically pressing challenges on urban
    territories by installing a disruptive change in urban planning already introduced
    in nearly all cities over the world by demanding citizens willing to change their
    surrounding living area (see strength and opportunities of ECS in Figure 5). The
    booming grass-rooted urban farming streams (e.g., over 200 in Rotterdam) can foster
    a paradigm shift in cities. There is extensive knowledge on ECS technologies,
    experiences and provided ecosystem services, and on the multiple benefits for
    urban regeneration, re-use of resources, and economic growth demonstrated in numerous
    pilots (see Section 3.1.). Our case study of Havana illustrates that local food
    demands can be satisfied by organically grown food on-site and how ECS can be
    mainstreamed in a city. The approach on productive urban landscape [10] is promising
    to integrate ECS of different scale into cities without disturbing the existing
    city´s structure. Moreover, ECS go along with global or local food initiatives
    (see examples Table 1). We identified several legal barriers for market uptake
    of ECS products mainly due to regulations on food quality and safety standards.
    There remains uncertainty on potential health risks of ECS products due to the
    high pollution loads in urban areas (e.g., [38]). Studies on healthiness of urban
    farming products demonstrated clearly that urban farming products can be safer
    than same products from common supermarkets following simple and low cost planting
    guidelines and protecting measures (e.g., [62]). ECS lack mainstreaming on city
    level to move out of informal state and to become self-sustaining identified as
    an urgent need by some city administrations (e.g., Rotterdam) to foster social
    resilience. ECS are often attributed to higher educated middle class people and
    might not always be accepted by vulnerable groups in target areas for urban regenerations,
    although best practice examples have overcome these barriers (e.g., Figure 1 and
    Section 3.1.) and stand for a highly socially inclusive instrument. A main weakness
    of mainstreaming ECS is the dependence on work programs from elected city councils,
    here our case studies aim to demonstrate, that long-term commitment of city councils
    and national programs foster ECS implementation beyond legislative’s period (Table
    1). A main threat to the establishment of ECS mentioned in our case study analysis
    (Table 1) and in literature is the precariousness of land access for ECS, mainly
    in growing cities [53,63]. Yet, paradoxically for an urban sustainability agendas
    land for ECS initiatives is mostly transferred for only short periods at a time
    to stabilize deprived neighborhoods and to provide social service. 4. Discussion
    Based on the reported practice in literature and the SWOT analysis of our case
    studies (summarized in Figure 5), we discuss a pool of strategic alignment to
    implement social efficient ECS. 4.1. Long-Term and Cross-Sectoral Mainstreaming
    of ECS Demonstrated by literature and by our case studies, city administrations
    started to recognize ECS as an integral part of planning, land use, and zoning
    ordinances and fill policy vacuums by setting up informal policies and master
    plans (see Table 1) and by adopting enabling ordinances, regulations on ECS, and
    fiscal policy instruments (e.g., [64]). Thus, a main strategy is lowering barriers
    and to changing legal aspects that pose hindrances concerning the supply of locally
    produced food in order to facilitate higher effectiveness, innovation and diversification
    for the local food system and to expand local food markets (see, e.g., Living
    Lab aims of case study cities). There is a need of a better understanding of how
    local, state, and federal legislations constrain or enable urban agriculture,
    thus regulation of urban agriculture has to be addressed (e.g., restrictions on
    sales of agricultural products, tax abatement, urban agriculture fees [64]). The
    sectoral functioning of cities is frequently identified as critical for ECS integration
    (see, e.g., Rotterdam, Andernach), which is also the main barrier for many decentralized
    solutions that aim to improve cities for both environmental and social challenges
    such as water infrastructure. As an example, Brown and Farrely [65] analyzed,
    that barriers are largely socio-institutional rather than technical, reflecting
    aspects related to community, resources, responsibility, knowledge, vision, commitment,
    and coordination and underline the urgent need of inter-sectoral professional
    development and inter- organizational coordination. Our ECS are conceptualized
    in combination with closed loop systems for sustainable water, nutrient and waste
    management (Figure 2). The localization of urban food production becomes a dominant
    strategy for dealing with limited natural resources in integrated approaches (e.g.,
    permaculture, circular economy) within the existing urban infrastructure [15].
    Living, working on a more local scale, producing, and consuming of zero-km food
    will reduce the overall footprint of our cities and the shift towards a systemic,
    circular alternative of ‘reduce, reuse, recycle, regenerate’ will meet demands
    for future generations [15]. The multi-functionality of ECS in terms of practice
    and governance is promising for the development of new territorial concepts [66]:
    cross-sectoral visions, plans, and strategies are needed to embrace the potential
    of ECS through the exploration and valuation of participatory envisioning processes.
    Additionally, this cross-sectoral mainstreaming will reduce the current short-term
    politic modes dependence on programs from elected city council. Among all case
    studies land assessment for ECS in growing cities was identified as crucial and
    the high success of Havana goes along with a national programs for urban and peri-urban
    food production and a protection of agricultural areas from construction (Table
    1). The precarious land access limits in particular disadvantaged communities
    [53]. Political anxieties related to provide vacant land for urban agriculture
    consists in perceptions of the polarity between ‘urban’ and ‘agriculture’, in
    doubts on stability of urban agriculture, in the absence of master plans and on
    land disposition serving for future growth of the city [63]. Thus, a successful
    ECS mainstreaming requires a holistic approach on multifunctional productive urban
    landscapes as a base for self-sustainment and an awareness rising for all target
    groups such as land use governance, private owner, cooperatives, and housing estate
    management among others. 4.2. Co-planning, Co-Design, and Co-Implementation To
    face these obstacles, most relevant actors should be involved by the multi-stakeholder
    approach in Bottom up—Top down—Hybrids in order to co-create, co-design, and co-plan
    ECS integration into urban planning processes. Practitioners of ECS are actively
    seeking in networks, how urban farming is done elsewhere [64] and gain high social
    acceptance and integration in neighborhood networks. Though community gardening
    and do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives often ask local governments for formal recognition,
    land access or assistance, the proactive modus vivendi of these initiatives taking
    over public spaces and the unauthorized creative alterations can challenge the
    status quo of the municipalities and their exclusive responsibility for planning
    and produce policy dissonance [67]. Numerous examples demonstrated, that a land
    use previously inconsistent with existing policies by grass-rooted initiatives
    turned into supported practices with active participation of governing authorities
    often via intermediary organizations [67]. This synergy will be the driving aspect
    for ECS implementation in cities to achieve an inclusive regeneration in target
    areas and enhance acceptance in vulnerable groups. We identified driving factors
    for successful co-implementation of ECS concerning socio-ergonomic, socio-cognitive,
    and socio-economic aspects to facilitate the overall participation of citizens
    (Table 2). Enhancing reachability, accessibility, and usability of ECS, lateral
    hierarchies and socio economic participation will particularly help disadvantaged
    groups in deprived neighborhoods. Certain information technology instruments have
    been developed to support informed decision making of cities administrations and
    citizen participation (e.g., [68,69]). Table 2. Driving factors for successful
    co-implementation of social efficient ECS. 4.3. Avoiding Green Gentrification
    As benefits for urban regeneration, social stabilization, re-use of resources,
    and economic growth were demonstrated in numerous pilots the main focus of city
    administrations lies on upgrading derelict areas with suspended groups suffering
    from marginalization trends (Table 1, [53,63]). The access of stakeholders within
    deprived neighborhoods to the knowledge on ECS technologies, best practices, and
    provided ecosystem services can be facilitated by simple guidelines, practical
    implementation plans and targeted city investments in ECS. A significant criticism
    of the ongoing sustainable urban planning is the ‘local trap’ [70], which describes
    the upgrading of certain city parts fostering gentrification and in consequence
    supports local hegemonic structures and serving as a flanking mechanism to neoliberalism
    (e.g., [71]). Within the ECS implementation strategies the threat to foster green
    gentrification has to be addressed properly to sustain the idea is to create public
    spaces that are used by long-time residents, making their ownership of the area
    more present and visible [63] and confronting the threats of deepening societal
    inequities by benefitting better resourced organizations and of displacement of
    lower-income households [53]. 4.4. Green Jobs Created by ECS The high societal
    relevance of ECS extents to all socioeconomic groups and promise a great potential
    for green jobs linked to innovative business models for a growing local market
    and improved value chains for the urban economies in transition. Besides the cost-effectiveness
    of ECS for the city administration implementing such solutions, a thorough change
    of business can be initiated. Sustainable financing models and green jobs are
    revived to contribute to city´s economic resilience. Legal barriers for market
    uptake of ECS products have to be addressed (e.g., Regulations on Food Quality
    and Safety Standards). Short and regional food supply chains contrast sharply
    to conventional anonymous supply chains of the global market by geographic proximity,
    economic viability, social orientation, and environmental sustainability [72].
    Short and regional food supply chains are hypothesized as more adaptive to our
    changing world. ECS implementation enhances food security and will foster effectiveness,
    innovation, and diversification for the local food system. Effective and resilient
    entrepreneurship provide greater stability against economic crises compared to
    large corporations through access to local markets and innovative business efforts.
    However, research on appropriate business models is scarce (but see [72]). There
    is a strong need for interconnecting innovative entrepreneurship with traditional
    technology SMEs and young novel start-ups with new business model approaches.
    The interlock of processes around the ECS net-chains is crucial to enhance economic
    feasibility of ECS. Mainstreaming strategies of ECS have been also criticized
    in social sciences as being used as device by the local governments to reach the
    primary goal of economic sustainability and enhanced economic competitiveness
    [73]. However, the improvement of individual social situation for residents in
    deprived areas through green jobs also address the environmental and socio-cultural
    dimension of sustainability and leads to awareness of environmental justice, mental
    and physical health through well-being and social cohesion. 5. Conclusions Urban
    planning is challenged to react to unavoidable densification trends and to growing
    pressure on environmental justice, social cohesion, livability, well-being, and
    resilient communities and neighborhoods already leading to increased criminality,
    segregation, violence against foreigners and refugees, abandoned ghettos and radical
    political streams, that are observed with growing concerns worldwide. Enhancing
    the provision of overall ecosystem services is proved to be an adequate instrument
    to foster urban livability, local identity, and social resilience. Around the
    world and across all socioeconomic groups, cultural and generational differences
    Edible City Solutions are booming and demonstrate a high potential for a participatory
    development of social cohesion. However, we observed a lack of mainstreaming knowledge
    on ECS technologies, experiences and provided ecosystem services. Short term actions
    within election periods, the sectoral functioning of city administrations and
    the current lack of integration of ECS into the urban planning process and of
    strategic support through urban policies limits exploitation of ECS benefits.
    Co-planning, co-design, and co-implementation of ECS are crucial to avoid green
    gentrification and to foster the strong involving and activating momentum of ECS.
    The holistic approach on multifunctional productive urban landscapes is the base
    for self-sustained cities. Strategic implementation of ECS rises the individual
    and public awareness for the paradigm shift of urban lifestyle needed to face
    successfully the challenges of the 21st century. Author Contributions Conceptualization:

  description: The planet is losing the valuable resource of soil to urban development,
    industrial agriculture, and other processes. Perhaps part of the problem is that
    we are not accurately valuing its worth? This chapter explores creating an economic
    system that is based on the value of compost (e.g. a type of soil) and the provisioning
    of food for local participants. The concept borrows from alternative currencies
    and ecosystem services literature and is discussed throughout. The concept called
    “soil currency” is defined with an exchange rate between the volume of inputs
    to create compost and the volume of compost needed to grow particular crops. The
    chapter goes on to discuss the strengths and challenges of such an economic system
    from a practical and technical perspective. The author provides one case study
    and some ideas for further research into properly valuing compost for the purpose
    of providing food to those without access. What follows is one possible version
    of a closed-loop economic system based on soil currency.

  explanation: Although this paper principally focuses on cybersecurity considerations
    within the framework of automated irrigation systems, it offers valuable insights
    into the successful implementation of autonomous irrigation systems in commercial
    settings.
  extract_1: One notable example is the implementation of a closed-loop, autonomous
    irrigation system on a commercial blueberry farm in California. The system utilized
    a combination of sensors, actuators, and a cloud-based decision-making platform
    to optimize irrigation schedules based on real-time soil moisture data.
  extract_2: The successful implementation resulted in significant water savings of
    up to 30%, improved crop yield, and reduced labor costs. This case study demonstrates
    the practical benefits of integrating automated irrigation systems in commercial
    settings and provides valuable insights for future implementations.

  key_findings: Cybersecurity is critical in protecting automated irrigation systems
    from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Closed-loop, autonomous irrigation
    systems can significantly improve water efficiency and crop yield. Integrated
    automated irrigation systems provide valuable benefits in commercial settings.
  limitations: The paper's main focus on cybersecurity considerations may limit its
    direct relevance to the specific point of case studies of successful implementations.
    It primarily discusses the importance of cybersecurity measures within these systems
    rather than providing detailed case studies.
  main_objective: To explore cybersecurity considerations and challenges associated
    with implementing integrated, automated irrigation systems.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper addresses the importance of integrating automated
    irrigation systems and highlights the benefits achieved through successful implementations.
    It provides a practical perspective on the effective usage of technologies within
    automated irrigation systems, aligning well with the review's focus on case studies
    of successful implementations.

  description: This study aims at proposing a business strategy to maintain the agricultural
    sector in Garut Regency during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Regardless of the fact that
    all sectors need special strategies to survive during the COVID-19 pandemic, there
    are still limited studies focusing on entrepreneurship strategies in the agriculture
    sector. The method used in this research was descriptive-qualitative with Garut
    Regency, Indonesia as the case study. Observations were made for a period of one
    year from October 2019 to October 2020 to observe the resilience of the agricultural
    sector in Garut district, Indonesia, as primary data and literature review was
    also used to support this analysis. The data collection results show a reduction
    in sales and production during the Covid-19 Pandemic due to physical distancing
    and other social restrictions policies that hinder activities, including the process
    of purchasing and distributing goods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the agricultural
    sector of Garut Regency used a closed-loop strategy, namely by establishing cooperation
    between farmers and the industrial as well as retail sectors. The success of implementing
    this strategy is shown from the stable amount of chili agricultural production
    during the pandemic, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Therefore, to support this strategy,
    a supporting strategy that considers internal and external factors in the agricultural
    sector is needed. This study uses SWOT analysis to determine important aspects
    in formulating solutions to agricultural problems during the pandemic. Based on
    the identified factors, various strategies were obtained to strengthen the economic
    structure of farmers from the short to the long term. As a result, farmers are
    expected to increase production and welfare as well as can become a momentum for
    strengthening national food independence. It is hoped that this research can be
    used as a reference for other researchers in their research and add insight.

  explanation: This study focuses on the economic challenges faced by the agricultural
    sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Garut Regency, Indonesia.
    Researchers examined how farmers implemented a closed-loop strategy, establishing
    partnerships with industries and retail sectors, to sustain their operations and
    maintain economic stability. The study also highlights the need for supporting
    strategies to strengthen the agricultural sector's internal and external factors.
    SWOT analysis was used to identify key aspects like production efficiency, market
    access, and environmental sustainability, which were then leveraged to develop
    strategies that aimed to enhance farmers' economic resilience.

  description: With the rapid increase in the world population, the global demand
    for food production has been increasing steeply. This increase has resulted in
    an increased demand for phosphorus crop fertilizers and livestock feed additives.
    Considering recent predictions that the global reserves of high-grade phosphorus
    resources would deplete within 15 years, new initiatives have begun to utilize
    low-grade resources to ensure sustainable supply of this essential nutrient. The
    main challenge with the use of low-grade resources is the difficulty with the
    efficient and economical separation of phosphorus from the other constituent elements,
    such as iron, aluminum, and magnesium. Most previous studies on the adoption of
    low-grade phosphate ores have focussed on ore beneficiation processes which are
    expensive, complex, and in some cases inefficient. In this study, we develop an
    integrated process for the direct recovery and separation of dicalcium phosphate
    dihydrate for fertilizer and livestock feed additive production from a low-grade
    (2.0 wt% P) iron-rich (19.7 wt% Fe) phosphate ore. The process combines leaching
    using dilute sulfuric acid (0.29 M) and selective precipitation using calcium
    oxide. During selective precipitation, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
    is used as a stabilizing agent to prevent iron and phosphorus co-precipitation.
    This process can be operated as a closed loop, allowing the recovery and recycling
    of both water and EDTA, while eliminating the production of liquid waste. The
    developed process achieves around 70% phosphorus recovery as an industrial-grade
    (19 wt% P) dicalcium phosphate dihydrate product with minimal iron, magnesium,
    and aluminum contamination, while also producing value-added calcium sulfate dihydrate
    (gypsum) and iron/magnesium byproducts. This process enables economical and sustainable
    recovery of phosphorus fromlow-grade ores, which can address the rising global
    demand for food production.

  explanation: 'This study describes the development and验证of a closed-loop, sustainable
    process for recovering phosphorus from a low-grade Brazilian phosphate ore. The
    process is based on the selective precipitation of phosphorus as dicalcium phosphate
    dihydrate (DCPD), using chelation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
    to prevent co-precipitation of iron impurities. The simplified process comprises
    three sequential precipitation steps at pH 3, 7.2, and 11.9, followed by an EDTA
    recovery step at pH 1.7. The process was demonstrated to effectively produce three
    value-added solid products: (1) gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) at pH 3, (2) DCPD at pH 7.2,
    and (3) an iron and magnesium-rich precipitate at pH 11.9. The DCPD product obtained
    had a P2O5 content of 43 wt% and a P2O5/RxOy ratio of 23.5, indicating minimal
    impurity content. The closed-loop nature of the process allowed for the efficient
    recycling of water and EDTA, minimizing reagent consumption and wastewater generation.
    The findings of this study provide a novel and environmentally sustainable approach
    for the recovery of phosphorus from low-grade ores, which can contribute to addressing
    the global demand for phosphate fertilizers without imposing negative environmental
    impacts.'
  extract_1: This work demonstrates the potential of a closed-loop, sustainable process
    for recovering phosphorus from a low-grade phosphate ore rich in FeO(OH) and SiO2.
    The process consists of leaching with H2SO4 followed by stabilization with EDTA,
    and selective precipitation with CaO. This process can be operated in a closed
    loop to recycle water and EDTA, allowing for efficient separation of P2O5 from
    co-extracted iron without a solvent extraction step.
  extract_2: The simplified version of the process was effective at efficiently producing
    the target products with fewer processing steps and complexity. As such, the simplified
    process, incorporating separations at pH 3, 7.2, 11.9, and 1.7 was selected as
    the best process configuration and its block flow diagram and mass balance is
    presented in the next section.

    recovery of phosphorus from low-grade ores, which can address the rising global
    demand for food production. Introduction Phosphorus is a key nutrient for living
    organisms due to its role in several key bioprocesses. In agriculture, phosphorus-containing
    fertilizers are employed to achieve sufficient crop growth and phosphorus-rich
    feed additives are used to enhance livestock nutrition. Phosphorus supplements
    are usually produced from high-grade phosphate rock concentrates (28–40 wt% P2O5).1
    The sources for this phosphate rock are either sedimentary phosphorites (29–35
    wt% P2O5) or igneous apatites (∼27 wt% P2O5), with the phosphorus occurring as
    apatite minerals (Ca5(PO4)3(F, OH, Cl)).2 The phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric
    acid (H3PO4) which is used to produce phosphate fertilizers. In the wet phosphoric
    acid process, the phosphate rock is reacted with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), producing
    gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) and aqueous phosphoric acid (reaction (1)).3 Ca5(PO4)3[F,
    OH, Cl](s) + 5H2SO4(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 3H3PO4(aq) + 5CaSO4·2H2O(s) + [HF, H2O, HCl](aq)
    (1) The main role of phosphate supplements is to deliver soluble and bioavailable
    phosphorus to plants and livestock as crop fertilizers or animal feed additives.1
    Crop fertilizers come in different forms such as monoammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4),
    diammonium phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4), single superphosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2 + CaSO4·2H2O,
    15–21 wt% P2O5) and triple superphosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2 > 40% P2O5), while livestock
    feed additives are usually in the form of dicalcium phosphate (CaHPO4), monocalcium
    phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), or defluorinated phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2).1,4–6 The P2O5
    grade, mineral form, and calcium content of these products are critical for their
    effective performance in their target applications and their market value. Given
    their bulk use, their efficient and economical production is essential.5,7,8 In
    particular, these products should be produced with minimal reagent and energy
    consumption and ideally produced near their point of use to minimize transportation
    costs. The global demand for phosphorus is continuously increasing. Between 2016
    and 2020, the demand has increased by 7% and it is predicted that by 2022, the
    demand will exceed the supply in several regions of the world, such as Latin America,
    South Asia, Europe, and Oceania.9 Considering that phosphate rock is a non-renewable
    resource, high-grade phosphorus deposits which are primarily located in Morocco,
    China, USA, Jordan, and Tunisia are depleting and the depletion is predicted to
    become critical around 2033.10,11 Considering the increasing depletion of high
    P2O5 grade resources, industrialists are highly interested on alternative phosphorus
    resources including low phosphorus grade ores,12 industrial waste products,13
    and municipal waste.14 The low P2O5 grade and high impurity concentration in these
    resources can cause operational challenges in the wet phosphoric acid process
    as follows:12,15 (a) feeds with less than 30 wt% P2O5 and high concentrations
    of calcium (CaO to P2O5 ratio > 1.6) increase transportation costs and lead to
    excessive sulfuric acid consumption, (b) excessive magnesium in the ore (MgO >
    1 wt%) can lead to filter blockage and problematic viscosities within the process,
    (c) aluminum and iron (Al2O3 + Fe2O3 > 3 wt%) can affect plant capacity, P2O5
    recovery, filtration rates, and introduce post-precipitation issues, (d) carbonates
    and organics (>5–6 wt%) can affect ore flotation, filtration rates, product color,
    and create foaming issues, (e) other minor impurities such as chlorine, fluorine,
    strontium, and heavy metals can cause various problems including corrosion, product
    safety, and crystallization issues. In Mato Grosso, one of the major agricultural
    regions of Brazil, a low-grade phosphate ore deposit containing 4.7 wt% P2O5 has
    been discovered which offers the potential for crop fertilizer and livestock feed
    additive production in close proximity to phosphate consuming farms. In this ore,
    phosphorus occurs as apatite (hydroxyapatite and chlorapatite) which is contained
    as a minor phase within the rock primarily composed of FeO(OH) and SiO2 with small
    amounts of other minerals including MgCO3, MgSiO3, H2Si6O13, and Al2H4Si2O9. Detailed
    characterization of the ore is provided in the Results and discussion section.
    The major challenge with this ore is the low phosphorus grade and high concentration
    of impurities such as iron, aluminum, and magnesium, which must be separated from
    the phosphorus to achieve acceptable P2O5 grades in the product. Developing a
    P2O5-containing product from this ore can help eliminate the need for transporting
    other ores to this agricultural region of the world, and the associated environmental
    and economic costs.16 There are several beneficiation techniques to increase the
    P2O5 content of ore concentrate to make a suitable feed for the wet phosphoric
    acid process. These include froth flotation of silicates and carbonates, attrition
    scrubbing and desliming of clays, electrostatic separation of silica, magnetic
    separation of ferriferous minerals, gravity separation of coarse phosphate minerals,
    calcination of calcareous minerals, and dilute organic acid leaching of carbonate
    minerals.12 These processes, although promising, are complex and expensive, and
    they are far from being adequate in achieving high-grade P2O5 products. Moreover,
    some of these processes are only applicable to phosphate ores with specific characteristics,
    e.g., presence of ferriferous or carbonate minerals. The separation of P2O5 from
    the other ore materials can also be achieved with solvent extraction after acid
    leaching; however, this process is expensive and reagent intensive because of
    the large number of mixer-settler stages required, and produces large volumes
    of organic waste.17,18 An alternative approach is selective precipitation after
    leaching. A previous study utilized this approach for incinerated wastewater treatment
    sludge, which is similar to a low-grade phosphate ore; however, their process
    relied on the high aluminum content of the ash (18 wt% Al2O3) which resulted in
    phosphorus recovery as aluminum phosphate (AlPO4), which is not a suitable for
    crop fertilizer or livestock feed additive production.19 In this study, a simple
    closed loop, low cost, and sustainable process was developed to recover the phosphorus
    content of the Brazilian low-grade ore and separate the impurities without using
    complex and costly beneficiation or costly solvent extraction circuits. In this
    process, the crushed ore was leached with sulfuric acid, and phosphorus along
    with impurities were extracted into the leachate. To separate phosphorus from
    impurities, a selective precipitation step with lime (CaO) was utilized. In the
    first trial, this process led to co-precipitation of iron with phosphorus. To
    avoid this problem, chelation stabilization with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
    (EDTA, H4C10H12N2O8/[C10H12N2O8]4−) was utilized after leaching, before selective
    precipitation. The complexation formation constant of several chelating agents
    such as DTPA (C14H23N3O10), EDDHA (C18H20N2O6), and DOTA (C16H28N4O8) with Fe3+
    is given in ESI Table S1.†20–22 The EDTA was selected for this study because it
    has the best compromise between high complexation formation constant and low cost.
    Since EDTA is an expensive reagent, compared to sulfuric acid and lime,23 its
    recovery and recycling is essential to make the process economical. Furthermore,
    in typical hydrometallurgical processes, the generation of hazardous waste, particularly
    liquid waste, can cause negative environmental impacts,24 which can be compounded
    by consumption and depletion of water resources. The developed process in this
    study involves water and EDTA recycling steps to ensure that the production of
    waste products is minimized. The process produces three solid products: (1) high-grade
    dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (main product), (2) gypsum, which can be used for
    manufacturing of wallboards, cement, and plaster of paris, or for soil conditioning
    (byproduct), and (3) iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)3)-rich product which can be used for
    pigment production (byproduct). The solid residue after the leaching step can
    be washed to remove excess acid and returned to the mine site as backfill. As
    noted above, EDTA was recovered and recycled to reduce reagent costs. Dissolved
    EDTA is known to precipitate from solution as its fully protonated acid form (H4EDTA)
    upon acidification below pH 2.0.25,26 In this process, the recovery of EDTA by
    acidification with H2SO4 offers the dual benefits of reducing the EDTA consumption
    and enabling water recycling because the remaining liquor can be further acidified
    to be used in the ore leaching step. The operating principle of the proposed process
    is similar to the approach used in previous studies on the regeneration of EDTA
    for the removal of heavy metals, such as cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc
    from contaminated soils.27–29 In these processes, solutions containing EDTA chelated
    with divalent cations (Me2+ = Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+) were mixed with soluble
    iron(iii) salts (such as FeCl3 or Fe(NO3)3) to substitute the chelated divalent
    cations with trivalent Fe3+, which is bound more strongly. The Fe–EDTA + Me2+
    solutions were then mixed with disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) to precipitate Me2+
    ions as phosphates. The iron was then removed by hydrolysis using either NaOH
    or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) to raise the pH such that Fe(OH)3 precipitates,
    allowing the EDTA solution to be re-used for soil flushing after pH adjustment.
    This study was focused on the development and validation of the closed loop phosphorous
    recovery process consisting of leaching with H2SO4 followed by stabilization with
    EDTA, and selective precipitation with CaO. By employing thorough chemical and
    physical characterization techniques, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental
    testing, a sustainable and economical road map is proposed. We expect our findings
    will help move towards addressing the increasing global demand for crop fertilizers
    and livestock feed additives without causing significant negative environmental
    impacts. Experimental Materials Phosphate ore from the Jauru municipality of Mato
    Grosso, Brazil was provided by BEMISA Group. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95.0–98.0 wt%,
    VWR), nitric acid (HNO3, 68.0–70.0 wt%, VWR), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5–38.0
    vol%, VWR), calcium oxide (CaO, 99.5 wt%, Materion), disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic
    acid dihydrate (Na2H2C10H12N2O8·2H2O, 99.5 wt%, EM Science), and deionized water
    (0.055 μS, Millipore) were used to perform the experiments. Certified multi-element
    standard stock solutions (Inorganic Ventures) were used for calibration of analytical
    instruments. Please note that for readability, and to differentiate the different
    forms of the polyprotic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in general (including
    the various ionized, bound, and/or protonated forms) was abbreviated as EDTA,
    H4C10H12N2O8 as H4EDTA, the [C10H12N2O8]4− ion as [EDTA]4−, and Na2H2C10H12N2O8·2H2O
    as Na2EDTA·2H2O. The EDTA is an organic polyprotic acid complexing agent (reaction
    (2)) that binds to dissolved metal ions (Mx+), forming a soluble metallo–organic
    complex (reaction (3), Fig. 1). The [EDTA]4− ligands around the metal ions prevent
    anions from interacting with the metal ion; hence, the formation of undesired
    precipitating species (e.g., FePO4·2H2O) is avoided. As a result, the phosphate
    product could be selectively precipitated without iron contamination. H4C10H12N2O8(s)

    are highlighted in blue and the bound metal ion (such as Fe3+, Al3+, Ca2+) is
    highlighted in magenta. The EDTA is a common and readily available chelating agent
    which can be used for stabilizing and solubilizing various metal ions. It has
    been used for the selective extraction of dysprosium during the solvent extraction
    of rare earth magnet leachates,30 for preventing calcium and magnesium phosphate
    precipitation in wastewater treatment,31 for preventing the precipitation of iron
    and arsenic during the transportation of drinking water samples,32 and the recovery
    of nickel from spent industrial catalysts,33 among other uses. The EDTA has also
    been utilized during separation of iron and titanium by selective precipitation;
    it was used to stabilize Fe3+ ions while TiO2+ ions were precipitated as titanium
    dioxide (TiO2) via hydrolysis using sodium hydroxide (NaOH).34 Compositional,
    mineralogical, and elemental mapping characterization The elemental composition
    of the as-received Jauru Ore (JO) was characterized by microwave assisted aqua
    regia digestion (MW-AR) followed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission
    spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Optima 8000). In MW-AR, the solid ore sample
    was digested in 3HCl : 1HNO3 (0.3–0.4 gsolids in 20 mL) at 200 °C (ramp up: 9
    °C min−1, hold: 20 min, ramp down: 5 °C min−1 – MARS6 Xpress microwave digestion
    system). The digested samples were filtered with 0.45 μm nylon syringe filters
    and diluted with 5 wt% HNO3 prior to measurement to ensure the concentrations
    were within the calibrated range (0–10.0 mg L−1). The concentrations of the elements
    of interest (sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, calcium,
    titanium, manganese, and iron) were quantified by ICP-OES. To prevent the precipitation
    of supersaturated solution components after sampling, the samples were diluted
    immediately after being taken. The crystal structure of the starting ore and solid
    products was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD – 2θ: 5–75°, scan rate:
    1.25° min−1, Rigaku MiniFlex 600 Diffractometer). Elemental mapping of the ore
    was conducted by electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA – JEOL JXA8230 5-WDS
    Electron Microprobe). Prior to EPMA analysis, the samples were fixed in epoxy
    resin (EpoKwick™ FC resin and hardener, Buehler) and cross-sectioned by polishing.
    Leaching trials Leaching experiments were performed to determine the leaching
    kinetics and leaching percentage and to make feeds for the precipitation step.
    Extraction efficiency was defined as the mass ratio in the liquor and the solid
    ore (eqn (4)). (4) where mA is the mass of element A in either the liquor or the
    solid ore, CICPOES is the concentration of element A in the liquor measured by
    ICP-OES, Vleach is the volume of acid solution used for leaching, mJO is the mass
    of JO solids used for leaching, CA in JO is the concentration of element A in
    the solids, as presented in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2 Ore characterization results. (a)

    silicon content. (b) X-ray diffractogram. (c) EPMA elemental mapping; the color
    scale for the EPMA maps show the relative elemental abundance and the scale is
    unique for each element. The ore particles were fixed in epoxy which contained
    chlorine and oxygen, leading to a high background reading for Cl and O. Unless
    otherwise noted, the ore was mixed with deionized water (0.30 gJO mL−1) and concentrated
    H2SO4 solution (0.1 gH2SO4 gJO−1) in a glass beaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer.
    In the trials using regenerated acid solution, the regenerated acid was mixed
    with make-up water and H2SO4 prior to ore addition. In the kinetic leaching trials,
    the slurry was sampled at regular time intervals and the samples were immediately
    filtered with a 0.45 μm nylon syringe filter. In the non-kinetic trials, leaching
    was stopped after 5 min by vacuum filtering the slurry using a 6 μm paper filter.
    Precipitation simulations Thermodynamic calculations were performed with OLI Studio
    9.6 and OLI Flowsheet 9.6 (OLI Systems) using the Mixed Solvent Electrolyte (MSE)
    model. The input concentrations for the calculations were set to approximate the
    experimentally measured liquor concentrations, using H2O, CaO, Fe2(SO4)3, Al2(SO4)3,
    CaSO4, Na2SO4, MgSO4, P2O5, H2SO4, H4C10H12N2O8, and Na2H2C10H12N2O8 as the input
    species. Precipitation trials Two different types of precipitation trials were
    performed: single-step precipitation to determine the pH levels at which each
    element precipitates, and a multi-step precipitation, which aimed to replicate
    the industrial process by including each of the proposed precipitation and separation
    steps. In the single-step precipitation trials, the filtered liquor from the leaching
    step was placed in a beaker equipped with a pH probe and magnetic stirring. First,
    Na2EDTA·2H2O was added to achieve a concentration of 30 mM EDTA in the solution.
    Then, solid CaO was slowly added to the solution to raise the pH and induce precipitation.
    At approximately regular pH intervals up to pH = 11, the solution was sampled
    by a syringe and immediately filtered with a 0.45 μm nylon syringe filter. The
    sample was immediately diluted with 5 wt% HNO3 and analyzed with ICP-OES to determine
    the elemental composition. The CaO was added slowly such that pH remained approximately
    stable for 5 min prior to making another addition. The multi-step precipitation
    trials were performed using the above approach; however, the process was carried
    out in a way that approximates the proposed industrial process, in which CaO is
    added to the solution to reach the target pH and a full solid–liquid separation
    is performed at each processing step. The target pH levels were selected on the
    basis of the single-step precipitation trials to maximize the separation of various
    solid products (P2O5 solids, impurities, regenerated reagents). The list of target
    pH levels and estimated required CaO or H2SO4 addition to reach the target pH
    are shown in Table 1. In the simplified process trial, steps 2 and 3 were combined
    to produce a single mixed P2O5 containing product, and steps 4 and 5 were combined
    to produce a single solid containing impurity elements. Table 1 List of separation
    steps in the multi-step precipitation process. The target pH for each processing
    step is given. The CaO/H2SO4 consumptions for each step were estimated by thermodynamic
    simulation (OLI v.9.6).35 Separation step Target pH Estimated CaO/H2SO4 addition

    acid solution In each step, the estimated amount of CaO (by OLI simulation) was
    added to the solution and it was left to stir for >2 h, until the pH had stabilized.
    If the target pH was not reached, the simulation was used to recalculate a new
    amount of CaO to add, and this process was repeated until the target pH was reached.
    This approach of using long equilibration times and controlled CaO additions was
    used to ensure that CaO was not in excess and sufficient time was allowed for
    all species to precipitate. Separations were conducted by vacuum filtration with
    6 μm filter paper and the collected solid products were dried at 40 °C for 24
    h and weighed to allow calculation of the product composition. The leachate solutions
    were brought to pH > 11 to precipitate the co-extracted impurities and the remaining
    P2O5 content. Sulfuric acid was then added to the calcium- and EDTA-containing
    solution to precipitate the EDTA as H4EDTA, which was collected. Then, H2SO4 was
    further added to produce an acidic solution analogous to the acid solution used
    in the initial leaching of the ore. In the trials in which recovered H4EDTA from
    a previous trial was used as the EDTA source, the dried H4EDTA solids were added
    to the process and the difference required to achieve 30 mM EDTA was added as
    Na2EDTA·2H2O. The H4EDTA content of the solids was estimated from the molar composition
    by assuming that the solids were a combination of CaSO4·2H2O (from the molar concentration
    of sulfur), Ca(OH)2 (from the molar concentration of calcium minus the calcium
    in CaSO4·2H2O), and H4EDTA (from the remaining mass). The estimated recovery was
    also corrected to account for solution losses due to sampling and filter cake
    humidity. The XRD analysis of the EDTA product showed that it is primarily composed
    of CaSO4·2H2O and H4EDTA. The amount of regenerated EDTA to add was calculated
    from the estimated H4EDTA content of the recovered solids from the previous trial.
    Results and discussion Characterization results Fig. 2a presents the elemental
    composition of the as-received ore, while Fig. 2b and c present the XRD diffractogram
    and elemental mapping obtained by EPMA characterization. As shown in Fig. 2a,
    iron (19.73 wt%), calcium (3.7 wt%), aluminum (1.64 wt%), and magnesium (1.44
    wt%) are the major constituents of the ore and phosphorus content is 2.04 wt%.
    The major crystal phases in the ore are FeO(OH) and SiO2 while it has a P2O5 grade
    of 4.67 wt%, primarily in the form of hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) with some chlorapatite
    (Ca5(PO4)3Cl). The elemental analysis in Fig. 2a does not account for 100% of
    the mass because the constituent metals are present in oxide form or carbonate
    form (magnesium). Also SiO2 that is one of the major ore components, is insoluble
    in aqua regia. Typically, fluorine from fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) is a problematic
    component of phosphate ores because its presence can lead to serious corrosion
    issues and cause serious health and safety risks.15 In this study, fluorine was
    not detected in the EPMA analysis (ESI Fig. S1†); thus, it was concluded that
    the fluorapatite content of this ore is negligible. As a result, fluorine extraction
    was not considered to be a major concern for this ore. If fluorine were present
    in this ore, the high content of SiO2 would likely result in the formation of
    silica gels which can cause operational challenges in the solid–liquid separation,
    rather than dangerous free hydrofluoric acid (HF);15 it is important to follow
    the fluorine fate if a fluorapatite-rich ore is used. Overall, this ore is similar
    to typical phosphate ores that have apatite as the primary phosphorus bearing
    phase; however, the P2O5 grade of this ore is at the lower extreme of the reported
    phosphate ores, which contain 5–39 wt% P2O5.1,2 Since this ore is rich in iron,
    aluminum, and magnesium contaminants (collectively RxOy) that are known to interfere
    with the quality of the precipitated fertilizer products,12,36,37 the primary
    goal of the proposed multi-step precipitation process is to extract the P2O5 content
    of the ore and separate it from the impurities, in order to produce crop fertilizer
    or livestock feed additive products. Acid leaching results Leaching experiments
    were conducted at three different H2SO4 concentrations, i.e., 0.0 M, 0.29 M, 1.45
    M, corresponding to 0.0, 0.1, and 0.5 gH2SO4 gJO−1. In all cases, a solid to liquids
    (S/L) ratio (S/L) of 0.3 g mL−1 was used and temperature was set at 25 °C. Fig.
    3a–c present the extraction efficiency of phosphorus and impurity elements at
    three acid levels as a function of time. The no-acid baseline resulted in negligible
    phosphorus, iron, aluminum, magnesium, and calcium and some sodium (10%) extraction.
    Increasing acid content resulted in increased extraction. Phosphorus extraction
    was almost the same for 0.29 and 1.45 M acid concentration, achieving around 70%
    after 25 min with the majority of extraction occurring within the first 5 min.
    On the contrary, increasing acid concentration resulted in increased impurity
    co-extraction. The different leaching behavior of phosphorus compared with other
    elements is due to the fact that phosphorus occurs as a distinct Ca5(PO4)3OH phase
    which reacts independently from the impurity-bearing phases. This means phosphorus
    can be selectively extracted by using low acid concentrations. Calcium extraction
    was approximately stable in both cases, with the solution first achieving slight
    supersaturation, then slowly decreasing in concentration as calcium precipitated,
    primarily as CaSO4·2H2O, confirmed by the co-localization of calcium and sulfur
    in the leached residue (ESI Fig. S2†). Fig. 3 Ore leaching kinetics. (a) 0.0 M,
    (b) 0.29 M, and (c) 1.45 M H2SO4. All trials were conducted at 25 °C, with a solid/liquids
    ratio of 0.3 gJO mL−1. Please note that calcium measurements for 1, 2, and 3 min
    for the 0.29 M trial were not quantified as the concentration was outside the
    calibration range of the instrument. Considering the effect of acid concentration
    on extraction, to minimize impurity co-extraction, 0.29 M H2SO4 concentration
    was selected as the best condition and was used in the process. To further minimize
    impurity co-extraction and the residence time for the leaching step, a leaching
    duration of 5 min was selected for the subsequent trials. It is important to note
    that the subsequent precipitation steps were performed immediately after filtering
    the leachate solution because a time-delayed formation of precipitate solids was
    observed in filtered leachate solution that was left undisturbed for several hours
    (ESI Fig. S3†); this solid was confirmed to be AlP, AlPO4 and Al(H2P3O10)(H2O)2
    by XRD. Although the process reached only 50–70% phosphorus extraction, the combination
    of short residence time (5–25 min), low acid concentration (0.29 M), high S/L
    of 0.3 g mL−1 and low temperature (25 °C) makes the process economical and practical.
    Comparing this process with other studies on the leaching of phosphorus from phosphate
    rocks show that higher phosphorus extractions can only be achieved at very high
    acid concentrations (25–35 wt% H3PO4), low S/L ratios (0.05–0.1 g mL−1) and long
    leaching durations (3–4 h)38,39 which justifies the advantages of the developed
    process in this study, since conditions were selected such that they are applicable
    at the larger scale. Each precipitation trial in the next step of the process
    used leachate from its own individual leaching trial; hence, the leachate composition
    was slightly different. Table 2 presents the average concentration of elements
    of interest for two different scenarios: (1) the case in which water and H2SO4
    were used as the leaching agent, (2) the case in which regenerated leachate with
    make-up water and H2SO4 were used as the leaching agent. The primary difference
    between these leachate solutions is the sodium content, which was considerably
    higher in the second case due to added sodium upon addition of Na2EDTA·2H2O. Table

    Precipitation results A pH-mediated selective precipitation step was developed
    to separate P2O5-containing products from the co-extracted impurities, in particular
    iron. The CaO was selected as the precipitating agent because of its abundance,
    low cost, and sufficient alkalinity. In addition to controlling pH, CaO provides
    a calcium source for the direct precipitation of calcium phosphate-based products,
    such as high-value livestock feed grade dicalcium phosphate (CaHPO4). Another
    benefit of CaO is the low solubility of gypsum, i.e., the neutralization product,
    which eliminates introducing large amounts of contaminating soluble ions during
    precipitation as NaOH or Na2CO3 would. As shown in Fig. 4a, using CaO alone did
    not result in efficient separation of phosphorus from iron because these elements
    precipitate in the same pH range. In a follow-up test using NaOH, the overlap
    in precipitation ranges was also observed; however, the phosphates did not fully
    precipitate due to the lack of an appropriate counterion (ESI Fig. S4†). Fig.
    4 Precipitation of extracted elements from the leachate with CaO. (a) The leachate
    solution was neutralized by adding solid CaO and sampled at various pH levels
    for analysis. (b) Thermodynamic simulation results (OLI Studio, v. 9.6) for the
    effect of EDTA addition on the precipitation of phosphorus and iron. A representative
    solution containing water, iron, aluminum, calcium, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus,
    and H2SO4 was used as the modeling basis and H4EDTA was added in the range of
    0–0.04 M. As mentioned previously, to prevent the co-precipitation of phosphorus
    and iron, likely as iron phosphate dihydrate (FePO4·2H2O) (reaction (5)), EDTA
    was utilized to stabilize the Fe3+ ions as Fe[EDTA]− according to reaction (6).
    By forming a stable soluble complex with EDTA (Kf = 1025.1),40 Fe3+ ions do not
    form a precipitate with PO43− ions. To estimate the stabilization capability of
    EDTA, thermodynamic simulations were performed using OLI Studio (v. 9.6). As shown
    in Fig. 4b, the simulation results showed that increasing EDTA concentration results
    in reduced iron–phosphorus co-precipitation up to a threshold level of EDTA after
    which the stabilization was maximized. Through EDTA stabilization, phosphorus
    and iron precipitation was decoupled, with the phosphorus precipitation completing
    at approximately pH = 6, primarily as either CaHPO4 (reaction (7)) at pH 3.7–4.9
    or hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) (reaction (8)) at pH 4.9–5.7. Iron started to
    precipitate as Fe(OH)3 (reaction (9)) after all the phosphorus had precipitated,
    at pH around 7. This precipitation would begin to occur at elevated pH values
    because at low H3O+ concentration levels, the hydrolysis reaction (reaction (9))
    is favored over the chelation reaction (reaction (6)). Fe(aq)3+ + PO4(aq)3− +
    2H2O(l) ⇌ FePO4·2H2O(s) (5) Fe(aq)3+ + [C10H12N2O8](aq)4− ⇌ [FeC10H12N2O8](aq)−
    (6) Ca2+ + PO43− + H3O+ ⇌ CaHPO4(s) + H2O (7) 5Ca2+ + 3PO43− + 2H2O ⇌ Ca5(PO4)3OH(s)
    + H3O+ (8) Fe3+ + 6H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H3O+ (9) The simulation results presented
    in Fig. 4b only consider the thermodynamics of the system and do not account for
    the kinetics. Hence, to gain a clear picture of the system''s behavior, the EDTA-mediated
    precipitation trends were measured experimentally. The EDTA concentration of 30
    mM was selected on the basis of the simulation and preliminary testing results.
    The experimental results (Fig. 5a) were in agreement with simulation results,
    but the measured pH thresholds were about 1 pH higher than their estimated counterparts.
    In the pH range of 1.2–3.1, the concentration of sulfur dropped sharply due to
    the precipitation of CaSO4·2H2O (reaction (10)). In the pH range of 3.7–4.9, small
    phosphorus precipitation was observed, but the major phosphorus precipitation
    was observed at pH range of 4.9–7.3. In this range, no iron or magnesium precipitation
    was observed with minimal aluminum precipitation. Iron was primarily precipitated
    between pH 8.9 and 9.9, coinciding with the precipitation of magnesium as magnesium
    hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) (reaction (11)). The precipitation of aluminum as aluminum
    hydroxide (Al(OH)3) started earlier at pH 8.0. Over the entire pH range, sodium
    concentration (introduced by the addition of Na2EDTA·2H2O) was constant because
    sodium salts are highly soluble. Ca2+ + SO42− + 2H2O ⇌ CaSO4·2H2O(s) (10) Mg2+

    EDTA-stabilized precipitation of extracted elements from the leachate with CaO.
    Jauru ore direct leaching solution (DLJO) was stabilized with 30 mM Na2EDTA·2H2O,
    and pH was increased by adding CaO. (a) Solution concentration at various pH levels.
    (b) Photographs of liquor appearance at each pH level. The physical appearance
    of the leachate solutions at various pH points is presented in Fig. 5b. Upon addition
    of Na2EDTA·2H2O, the clear leachate solution immediately turned yellow due to
    the formation of [Fe–EDTA]−, which is known to have a yellow-brown color.41 As
    the phosphorus precipitated out of the solution, the yellow color shifted to red
    and as the iron precipitated, the red color was lost, leaving behind a clear solution.
    Since the observed color changes coincide with the various precipitation events,
    colorimetry can potentially be utilized for real time process monitoring at the
    industrial scale. The primary separation optimization objective for this process
    was the production of high-grade P2O5 solids with minimal iron, aluminum, and
    magnesium contamination. On the basis of the above precipitation investigation,
    further simulation and additional preliminary testing, the following precipitation
    steps were selected, constituting the full selective precipitation train: (1)
    leachate → pH 3.0: precipitation of CaSO4·2H2O. This byproduct must be removed
    because it reduces the P2O5 grade in the precipitate. It can be sold for manufacturing
    of wallboards, cement, and plaster of paris, or for soil conditioning. (2) pH
    3.0 → pH 4.8: precipitation of CaHPO4. This product represents the phosphate fertilizer
    product with higher P2O5 content and can potentially be used as a livestock feed
    additive. (3) pH 4.8 → pH 6.5: precipitation of Ca5(PO4)3OH. This product represents
    the phosphate fertilizer product with lower P2O5 content. (4) pH 6.5 → pH 9.5:
    precipitation of Fe(OH)3-rich solids. This product, which may contain undissolved
    CaO as Ca(OH)2 (CaO readily hydrates to Ca(OH)2 upon contact with water), represents
    the primary impurities that were co-extracted from the ore. These iron-rich solids
    could potentially be sold as an iron ore or be used as a feedstock for the production
    of specialty Fe-containing products, such as iron oxide pigments. (5) pH 9.5 →
    pH > 11: this impurity product is expected to be relatively rich in Mg(OH)2 compared
    with the previous product and could potentially be sold as a precursor to fused
    magnesia (MgO) for construction materials. The solution remaining after this precipitation
    train principally contains dissolved Ca2+, Na+, and SO42−, alongside soluble EDTA,
    present primarily as Ca[EDTA]2− complexes. Since EDTA is an expensive reagent,
    the economical operation of this process requires the recovery and recycling of
    EDTA. Furthermore, minimizing water consumption and wastewater production is crucial
    for the environmental sustainability of the process. Considering that neutral
    H4EDTA salt can be precipitated from aqueous solution by acidification with H2SO4,25,26
    and that the liquor remaining after filtration is relatively free of contaminating
    ions (see details below), the acidification of the filtered liquor can serve the
    dual purposes of recovering EDTA and regenerating the wastewater into an acidic
    leaching agent for the initial leaching step. The target acid regeneration pH
    of 0.6 corresponds to the pH of 0.29 M H2SO4 solution. As such, the following
    acid addition steps were added to the process: (6) pH > 11 → pH 2.0: precipitation
    of H4EDTA. This EDTA can be used to replace the Na2EDTA·2H2O used in the initial
    cycle (ESI Fig. S5†). This H4EDTA product contained CaSO4·2H2O solids; however,
    this contaminant did not affect the efficacy of the recycled EDTA and was captured
    during precipitation step 1 (at pH = 3). (7) pH 2.0 → pH 0.6: regeneration of
    the acidic leaching solution. Upon acidification, the liquor can be recycled for
    the initial ore leaching step. Complete process trials (leaching, stabilization,
    precipitation) The complete precipitation train outlined above was repeated, and
    at each precipitation step and complete solid–liquid separations were performed.
    Two complete process trials were performed: (A) an initial start-up cycle in which
    deionized water and H2SO4 were used as the leaching agent and EDTA was added as
    Na2EDTA·2H2O. (B) A continuous cycle, in which regenerated leachate and H4EDTA
    were used. Make-up water and H2SO4 solution were added to maintain a consistent
    S/L ratio. Make-up Na2EDTA·2H2O was added to maintain an EDTA concentration of
    30 mM. As shown in concentration-pH curves in Fig. 6a and b, the phosphorus and
    iron precipitations are well separated, consistent with the precipitation results
    shown in Fig. 5a. In trial A, a small iron-phosphorus co-precipitation was observed,
    but this did not happen in trial B. The decrease in iron co-precipitation in trial
    B (recycle trial) could be related to the addition of EDTA as H4EDTA rather than
    Na2EDTA·2H2O, which suggests that operating the process as a closed loop could
    reduce iron impurity in the product. Additionally, the bulk of aluminum precipitation
    occurred in the phosphate precipitation steps, on the contrary to the observed
    precipitation curve, but consistent with the simulation results. The discrepancy
    between the two trials could be due to the slow precipitation kinetics of Al(OH)3,
    which has previously been observed to precipitate at pH > 4.5 in a two-step reaction
    (a rapid step and a slow step).42 The extended equilibration times used in the
    complete process trials were sufficient for the Al(OH)3 to fully precipitate,
    whereas, the sampling in the precipitation curve trials (Fig. 5a) was too rapid
    to observe aluminum precipitation at lower pH values. In the complete process
    trials, the process equilibration time was slow because the calcium phosphate
    precipitation was limited by the release of Ca2+ ions from CaO/Ca(OH)2 dissolution.
    Because of the low solubility of Ca(OH)2, long equilibration times were needed
    to prevent the contamination of the solid products with excess Ca(OH)2 which would
    have reduced the P2O5 grade. The importance of CaO/Ca(OH)2 dissolution on the
    precipitation process also justifies the room temperature (25 °C) operation of
    the process, because Ca(OH)2 exhibits retrograde solubility (a decrease in solubility
    with increasing temperature); thus, operating the process at low temperature is
    more beneficial to obtain a higher grade product. Fig. 6 Concentration-pH curve
    for the complete selective precipitation process trials. The separations outlined
    in Table 1 were performed using (a) newly mixed leaching solution and Na2EDTA·2H2O,
    and (b) regenerated leachate solution and precipitated H4EDTA alongside make-up
    water and EDTA. The left panels show the liquor concentrations during the CaO
    addition steps. The middle panels show the liquor concentrations during the H2SO4
    addition steps. The right panels show the amounts of CaO (solid) and H2SO4 (95–98
    wt%) added to achieve the reported pH changes. In both trials A and B, the EDTA
    recovery and acid regeneration steps were consistent with calcium precipitating
    in the pH range of >11 → 2 as CaSO4·2H2O and no observable precipitation in the
    pH range of 2 → 0.6. In the first precipitation step, the expected precipitation
    of H4EDTA could not be verified by ICP-OES; however, XRD characterization of the
    precipitate confirmed H4EDTA presence. In both trials, the CaO and H2SO4 consumptions
    were nearly identical, indicating that the reagent consumptions are not negatively
    impacted by recycling of EDTA and water. The compositions of the solid products
    (both elemental and oxide-equivalent mass compositions) produced in these trials
    and the molar elemental recoveries for each step (accounting for the relative
    amounts of solid products produced) are presented in Fig. 7a and b. As expected,
    the pH 3 product was primarily composed of calcium and sulfur in the form of CaSO4·2H2O,
    with negligible co-precipitation of phosphorus, iron, or aluminum. Together, the
    phosphate products (pH 4.8 and 6.5) represent 94–95% of the total extracted phosphate
    in the leachate. These products had nearly equimolar calcium and phosphorus, indicating
    that a high proportion of the phosphate precipitated as the higher-value CaHPO4
    (1P : 1Ca molar ratio), rather than Ca5(PO4)3OH (3P : 5Ca molar ratio); however,
    the P2O5 grades of the products (36.9–41.9 wt%P2O5) were lower than the expected
    value for CaHPO4 (theoretical P2O5 = 52.2 wt%). During the neutralization of phosphoric
    acid with calcium hydroxide at temperatures below 60 °C, CaHPO4 is known to precipitate
    as its dihydrate (CaHPO4·2H2O).43 The measured P2O5 grades for the pH 4.8 and
    6.5 products were consistent with the theoretical P2O5 grade of CaHPO4·2H2O (41.2
    wt%). The formation of CaHPO4·2H2O was confirmed by XRD (Fig. 8g). The observed
    molar excess of calcium relative to phosphorus can be attributed to unreacted
    Ca(OH)2. Fig. 7 Solid product characteristics for the complete precipitation process
    trials. The separations outlined in Table 1 were performed using (a) fresh H2O
    + H2SO4 leaching agent and Na2EDTA·2H2O, and (b) regenerated leachate solution
    and precipitated H4EDTA alongside make-up water and EDTA. The left panels show
    the elemental composition of each solid, alongside the recovered dry mass of each
    product. The middle panels show the oxide-equivalent mass of P2O5, Fe2O3, Al2O3,
    and MgO in the solids. The right panels show the molar recovery of each precipitation
    step. Fig. 8 Liquor concentration and solid product composition for the simplified
    selective precipitation trials. The separations were carried out as outlined in
    Table 1; however, steps 2–3 and 4–5 were combined into single steps. The trial
    was performed using regenerated leachate solution and precipitated H4EDTA alongside
    make-up water and EDTA. (a) Liquor concentrations during the CaO addition steps.

    Solid product XRD diffractograms. The peak intensities were normalized to aid
    visualization. The observed predominance of CaHPO4·2H2O precipitation over Ca5(PO4)3OH
    was contrary to the results predicted by thermodynamic simulation; however, the
    simulation did not account for the kinetics of precipitation. Previous work has
    shown that calcium phosphate precipitation kinetics and the resulting mineral
    phases are highly pH dependent, i.e., the nucleation of crystalline CaHPO4·2H2O
    is favored over octacalcium phosphate (Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4·5H2O) and calcium deficient
    apatite at low pH, which was aided by the natural increase in pH driven by the
    H3O+-consuming precipitation reactions (reaction (7)).44 Because of the slow dissolution
    of CaO upon addition to the leachate solution, the majority of precipitation was
    able to occur at lower pH levels, resulting in higher-than-predicted formation
    of CaHPO4·2H2O. In the impurity precipitation steps for both trials, the pH stabilized
    in the range of 8.5–8.7 after adding the prescribed amount of CaO and the impurity
    split was made at this pH rather than further adjusting the pH. The majority of
    the impurity solids were precipitated at pH < 8.5–8.7, comprising iron, as Fe(OH)3,
    some magnesium as Mg(OH)2, any unreacted Ca(OH)2 (as predicted by the simulations
    and observed by XRD – Fig. 8g), and the remaining 5–6% of unprecipitated P2O5.
    The pH 11 impurity solids were enriched in magnesium, while having a high content
    of iron and calcium. Since the processes are open to the atmosphere, it is possible
    that dissolution of atmospheric CO2 could cause some of the calcium to precipitate
    as CaCO3; however, this effect was likely small because CO2 was not actively injected
    into the solution, leading to a low gas–liquid interfacial area, and thus a slow
    rate of CO2 uptake.45 The pH 4.8 and pH 7.0 products were recovered separately
    because they were expected to have considerably different P2O5 grades and calcium
    to phosphorus (Ca/P) ratios; however, the results of these trials indicated that
    the properties of these two products are relatively similar; thus, it does not
    justify the use of two separation steps. Similarly, the two impurity products
    were collected separately to achieve iron and magnesium separation; however, both
    impurity solids contained both species; thus, process complexity could be avoided
    by collecting these two solids as a single product, as described below in the
    simplified process trials section. Compared with the primary phosphate product,
    these impurity products are produced in considerably smaller amounts and contain
    a large amount of unreacted Ca(OH)2; however, these products may still be used
    productively. One possible use is as a low grade iron ore, i.e., while the iron
    content (7.8–22.4 wt% iron) is considerably lower than that of typical iron ores,
    the primary impurity components are magnesium and calcium, which are typically
    mixed with iron ore as fluxing agents in blast furnace operations. The obtained
    precipitate could potentially be sold as an ore-flux mixture. Alternatively, this
    product could be sold as feed material for the production of iron oxide pigments
    because it is enriched in Fe(OH)3.46 The H4EDTA product yield was similar in both
    trials, with solids having an estimated 60 wt% H4EDTA content with 80–89% EDTA
    recovery (corrected to account for losses to sampling and filter cake moisture).
    This recovered EDTA can be used as a substitute for fresh Na2EDTA·2H2O, which
    was verified by conducting a precipitation experiment (similar to the experiment
    shown in Fig. 5a) using only recovered H4EDTA as the EDTA source, the results
    of which are presented in ESI Fig. S5.† Simplified process trial (leaching, stabilization,
    precipitation) A simplified version of the process was tested in which precipitation
    steps 2 and 3 were combined into a single step at approximately pH 7 (pH 7.2),
    and the impurity precipitation steps 4 and 5 were combined into a single step
    at pH > 11 (pH 11.9) (Fig. 8a–g). This simplified process employed recycled H4EDTA
    and leaching solution. In this process configuration, similar to previous trials,
    clear separation of phosphorus and iron was achieved, and the reagent consumption
    was nearly identical. The pH 7.2 product contained 99% of the extracted phosphorus,
    achieving a P2O5 grade of 39.6 wt% and a P2O5/RxOy ratio of 23.5 (8% of the extracted
    iron, 66% of the extracted aluminium, and 9% of the extracted magnesium were co-precipitated).
    Thus, by reducing process complexity, the product recovery and quality were both
    improved, potentially due to the presence of crystalline CaHPO4·2H2O precipitate
    in the slurry that was formed in the lower pH range at the start of the precipitation
    step, which act as a seed for CaHPO4·2H2O crystallization near the end of the
    step at higher pH. Only 1% of the extracted phosphorus was lost to the impurity
    products, which were primarily composed of calcium and iron with some magnesium
    and sulfur. This impurity product removed nearly all the remaining extracted iron
    (91%), aluminium (32%), and magnesium (91%) in the liquor. As mentioned above,
    the phosphate product occurred primarily as hydrated CaHPO4·2H2O, which has a
    lower P2O5 grade than the anhydrous form. Anhydrous CaHPO4 is known to precipitate
    directly at temperatures above 70 °C;47 however, as mentioned above, the retrograde
    solubility of Ca(OH)2 would further reduce the rate of phosphate precipitation;
    thus, requiring longer residence times. The CaHPO4·2H2O is known to thermally
    dehydrate at temperatures above 135 °C;48 therefore, the product can be heat treated
    to increase the its P2O5 grade. By drying the product at 150 °C, the P2O5 grade
    could be further increased to 43.4 wt%, consistent with a partial dehydration
    of the dihydrate product to anhydrous dicalcium phosphate. No major crystal phase
    change was detected by XRD in the 150 °C sample; however, the dihydrate to anhydrous
    phase transition has previously been reported to not produce strong X-ray diffraction
    pattern changes when the heating is conducted in dry air.48 Further optimization
    of the product drying to achieve complete dehydration was deemed outside the scope
    of this study, but can be addressed in future work. Overall, the dicalcium phosphate
    dihydrate (DCP) product composition is comparable to commercially available DCP
    products.49 Upon re-acidification at pH 1.70, the EDTA was precipitated as a mixed
    H4EDTA + CaSO4·2H2O solid (Fig. 8g). The estimated EDTA recovery in this process
    was 87%. This indicates that the presence of sulfur does not negatively affect
    the binding of EDTA–Fe. The EDTA loss is due to the liquor held by the wet filter
    cakes during the solid–liquid separation steps. In practice at the industrial
    scale, this lost EDTA can be recovered by washing the filter cake with water,
    which can also supply the make-up water that must be added to compensate for the
    humidity losses in the product drying steps. Furthermore, the EDTA loss could
    partially be due to entrainment of EDTA during various precipitation steps. Given
    the critical nature of EDTA consumption to the overall operating costs, further
    optimization at the pilot scale should be undertaken to quantify and reduce EDTA
    losses at each step of the process. The simplified version of the process was
    effective at efficiently producing the target products with fewer processing steps
    and complexity. As such, the simplified process, incorporating separations at
    pH 3, 7.2, 11.9, and 1.7 was selected as the best process configuration and its
    block flow diagram and mass balance is presented in the next section. Block flow
    diagram and mass balance of the simplified process The cyclical leaching and selective
    precipitation trials demonstrated the potential of operating the developed process
    continuously, in a closed loop, as illustrated in Fig. 9. In this process, fresh
    ore is first selectively leached in relatively dilute (0.29 M) sulfuric acid,
    producing a phosphate- and iron-rich leachate. The solid residues of the leaching
    step can potentially be washed with water to remove any residual acidity, allowing
    the ore to be landfilled or backfilled (the wash water could then be used as make-up
    water in the process). The iron content of the leachate is then stabilized using
    EDTA as a chelating agent, allowing selective precipitation of phosphorus using
    CaO. Fig. 9 Block flow diagram of the overall process for P2O5 recovery from low-grade
    phosphate ore. The selective precipitation sequentially produces three value-added
    solid products. (1) At pH 3, CaSO4·2H2O is produced, which can be used for manufacturing
    of wallboards, cement, and plaster of paris, or for soil conditioning. Similar
    to phosphogypsum, the solid CaSO4·2H2O byproduct of the wet phosphoric acid process,
    can be used directly for various applications, although it may require some purification
    if the final product proves to have unacceptable levels of fluoride, organic matter,
    or radionuclides, such as Ra226, Pb210, Po210, U238 or U234.50 (2) At pH 7, the
    primary product, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate is precipitated. As mentioned above,
    the phosphorus and impurities content of this product is consistent with commercially
    employed DCP products.49 (3) At pH > 11, the co-extracted iron and magnesium are
    precipitated, providing a potential low-grade iron ore product or a feedstock
    for pigment production. Since these various products can be employed in several
    different applications, the properties and specifications should be verified according
    to the specific end-use in future pilot-scale testing, and appropriate pretreatment
    or purification steps should be specified and employed if necessary. This process
    can operate as a closed loop because the alkaline EDTA-bearing solution remaining
    after selective precipitation can be re-acidified with H2SO4, precipitating recyclable
    H4EDTA and CaSO4·2H2O solids at pH 1.7. After solid–liquid separation, the liquor
    can be employed as regenerated leachant for the initial leaching step at pH ∼
    0.6. The physical appearance of the slurries, filtered solutions, and wet filter
    cakes are shown in ESI Fig. S6.† Because of the cyclical nature of the process,
    majority of the water and EDTA are recycled; hence, it only requires small make-up
    additions to account for lost water to humidity in the solid filter cakes and
    lost EDTA as an impurity in the solid products. Hence, the only major reagents
    required for the process are H2SO4 and CaO. The mass balance for the system at
    an industrial scale (1000 kg ore) was estimated on the basis of the laboratory
    scale results for the simplified process trial and the results are presented in
    Table 3. These estimations were made based on the following assumptions: Table

    be scaled to the pilot/industrial scale. (2) The solid–liquid separations are
    100% efficient at separating the liquor and the precipitated solids. This could
    potentially be achieved by using the make-up water for the process to wash each
    solid product. (3) The effect of water-containing solids such as CaSO4·2H2O on
    the water content of the system is negligible. (4) The total liquid volume of
    the system is approximately constant at 3.3 m3. The addition of CaO, H2SO4 and
    EDTA does not significantly affect the liquid volume in the system. The large-scale
    production rates and reagent consumptions are only estimates based on the laboratory
    scale results and require validation with pilot-scale testing, in particular for
    further understanding the liquor losses in solid–liquid separation, the requirements
    for water and EDTA make-up, and potential scale-related effects. The EDTA consumption
    is a key process performance indicator because it is considerably more expensive
    than the other reagents. The economic feasibility of this process was preliminarily
    assessed by estimating the reagents costs and revenue from the products (Table
    S2†). The net revenue for the as-is process was estimated to be $3.50 (USD) per
    tonne of processed ore. One of the major contributors to the cost was the 4 kg
    per tonne make-up Na2EDTA; however, since the process could be optimized such
    that 100% of EDTA is recovered, a revenue of up to $8.81 (USD) per tonne of ore
    could be achieved. Hence, there is a potential for this process to be operated
    profitably. Since ore transportation costs are a major cost contributor for phosphate
    fertilizer production in Brazil,16 this process is an economically attractive
    option of mining and processing of low-grade phosphate ore directly in the agricultural
    region of Mato Grosso, where it will ultimately be used. Conclusions In this work,
    a dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (CaHPO4·2H2O) product was produced from a low-grade
    phosphate ore rich in FeO(OH) and SiO2. The process consisted of leaching with
    H2SO4 followed by stabilization with EDTA, and selective precipitation with CaO.
    This process can be operated in a closed loop to recycle water and EDTA, allowing
    for efficient separation of P2O5 from co-extracted iron without a solvent extraction
    step. The EDTA forms a complex with Fe3+ ions, stabilizing them in the solution,
    which prevents their co-precipitation with phosphorus. This process produces three
    primary products, i.e., CaSO4·2H2O, CaHPO4·2H2O, and an iron and magnesium rich
    precipitate, without producing any major liquid waste. The solid residue after
    leaching step can potentially be washed and backfilled to reduce the environmental
    impacts. The CaHPO4·2H2O product (43 wt% P2O5) contains minimal impurities (P2O5/RxOy
    = 23.5) and can be used directly for fertilizer or livestock feed additive production.
    The developed process enables production of value-added products from a low-grade
    ore with minimal reagent consumption and minimal wastewater generation. The processing
    steps proposed in this work, i.e., leaching, ion stabilization, selective precipitation,
    and reagent recovery can potentially be adapted for other low-grade phosphorus
    resources or even secondary resources such as sewage or municipal waste.14,51
    As an example, a phosphorus enrichment process for municipal solid waste incineration
    fly ash has been reported which produces a solid product relatively similar to
    the low-grade phosphate ore used in this process.52 The results of this work can
    help address global nutritional demand without imposing negative impacts on the
    environment. Author contributions John Anawati: designing and performing experiments,

      process for recovering phosphorus from a low-grade phosphate ore rich in FeO(OH)
      and SiO2. The process consists of leaching with H2SO4 followed by stabilization
      with EDTA, and selective precipitation with CaO. This process can be operated
      in a closed loop to recycle water and EDTA, allowing for efficient separation
      of P2O5 from co-extracted iron without a solvent extraction step.

  description: The competitive environment in the global market makes most countries
    look for better ways to solve their problems. Food waste is the largest concern
    facing the food security of the world. Not paying attention to process of pomegranate
    wastes, such as separating the peel from the other parts and ignoring the cost
    of using artificial intelligence for pest control in gardens and the cost of maintaining
    the processed products are the gaps of previous researches. To cope with this
    challenge, recent studies have presented sustainable closed-loop supply chains
    (SCLSCs) as a strategic approach and a competitive advantage. The present study
    distinguishes itself from other studies by using the artificial intelligence technology
    in a supply chain along with the reverse logistics section, i.e., waste recycling.
    This paper proposes a design for a CLSC pomegranates. The corresponding logistics
    network is designed for several periods and covers manufacturers, distribution
    centers, customers, factories, recycling centers (compost centers), and compost
    end user (compost markets). Using reverse logistics, the wasted pomegranates are
    also converted into recycled products including ethanol, as an automotive fuel
    and a renewable energy, and a type of compost processed as an organic fertilizer.
    The goal of proposed model is to minimize the costs of supply chains, reduce the
    supply risks involved, and increase the profits for gardeners and investors in
    the public and non-profit agriculture sectors in Iran. The first pareto solution
    is 1,869,908.962, 2172.638 and 65.926, and the CPU time is 412 Ms. The results
    show a rise in the maximum supply risk occurs in the total cost and risk but a
    reduction in the accountability of the network and also an increase in the disruption
    period findings in increased total cost and risk of the network, while it first
    increases and then decreases the accountability.

  explanation: The annotated bibliography focuses on the application of automated
    systems in real-time irrigation management. It emphasizes challenges and strategies
    for integrating them into existing infrastructure and precision agriculture technologies.
    The specific point of focus is on case studies of successful closed-loop, autonomous
    irrigation systems in research and commercial settings. The review concludes with
    insights into the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless
    communication and compatibility across automated irrigation management systems.
    This real-time irrigation management explains how an automated system uses sensors
    to collect data on soil moisture, plant water status, and weather conditions.
    This data is then used to adjust irrigation schedules accordingly, ensuring that
    plants receive the right amount of water at the right time to optimize growth
    and yields. The review also highlights the importance of interoperability and
    standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility across automated
    irrigation management systems.

    Article 13 December 2023 1 Introduction Nowadays, supply chains (SC) serve as
    structured circulating complexes that undertake both forward and backward flows.
    A network of members that work together in a supply cycle is called a closed-loop
    supply chain (CLSC) (Jabbarzadeh et al., 2016). Define of a SC plays a significant
    role in its management. SC often face a different of uncertainties as in demand
    and costs (Tan et al., 2019). Since customers have many choices and resources
    to meet their needs, it is vital for suppliers to offer their final products in
    the distribution network at the lowest price and with the best accessibility.
    The need to improve operations, the growing importance of the global trade, transportation
    costs, and intense competitive pressure are the major reasons for the necessity
    of supply chains. The absence of a overall management and information system and
    a practical model in the country''s SC of agri-food products has caused this sector
    to not be efficient despite its potential. One of the biggest problems in the
    agricultural and food sectors in any country is the gap of knowledge of farmers
    about the optimal planting of agricultural products based on the demand in that
    society. Disruption of this equality causes us to face a surplus of a product
    throughout the year, which causes the price of the product to drop and farmers
    face financial loss. In addition, by causing a decrease in the amount of other
    products, the price of the product increases. This requires the study of logistic
    models in the agri-food sector (Takavakoglou et al., 2022). Defective products
    and waste have always been an important challenge for agri-food producers. They
    have found that product recycling and reuse of products, waste and product residues
    not only reduce harmful effects for the environment, but also improve their competitive
    position in the market. From this point of view, the efforts in the field of recycling
    and logistics activities have caused organizations to focus on closing the SC
    loop and creating a CLSC. This structure can achieve the economic, social and
    environmental goals of the organization at the same time (Tirkolaee et al., 2022).
    With the fast agricultural industrialization, growing world wide food request
    and raise challenge about food quality and safety, the concept of transparency
    is gaining increasingly importance in the agricultural sector. The sustainable
    management of these circumstances is done by business managers who often make
    small benefits and have to meet the strict requirements imposed by great customers
    and retailers (Mangla et al., 2018). An agriculture-food supply chain (AFSC) is
    a system that includes raw material producers, processors, distributors and consumers
    (Borodin et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2019; Utomo et al., 2018). Increasing customer
    information about products has made food safety the most important factor for
    producers. Based on the Food Agricultural Organization (FAO), industrial pomegranate-processing
    centers produce estimately 1.5 million tons of waste yearly, with tremendous nutritional
    value. Different parts of pomegranate other than aryl are considered as agricultural
    waste; due to their antioxidant effects, they are used as additives in the cosmetics
    industry (Borodin et al., 2016). Pomegranate skin and juice have been used as
    anti-inflammatory in the treatment of diseases for a long time in traditional
    Chinese medicine (Utomo et al., 2018). A recent study (Hu et al., 2019) reinforces
    the benefits of pomegranate as a fruit that improves metabolic syndromes. Metabolic
    syndrome is a common term in medical science that refers to the diseases of diabetes,
    high blood pressure and obesity. This disease causes people suffering from it
    to have a heart attack or stroke. The extraction of ethanol from pomegranate waste
    and peel is another benefit of the fruit which is discussed in the present study.
    Ethanol has applications in car fuel production (Kalaycıoğlu & Erim, 2017; Liu
    et al., 2017). Although several studies have addressed horticultural issues in
    supply chains, this study addresses reverse logistics and the return of products
    from different sectors; it focuses on rotten and wasted pomegranate fruit as a
    research gap. To this end, the research uses artificial intelligence to reduce
    pest damage and the rate of pre-harvest rotting. The rotten and pest-infested
    pomegranates are identified and processed by images (Silva et al., 2013) and go
    from the garden to the compost center to become a fertilizer (Mangla et al., 2018).
    The ability to use computer imaging and combine it with artificial intelligence
    algorithms in agriculture is significant (Dhande et al., 2021). Computer image
    processing has flourished owing to reduced equipment costs, promoted computing
    power, and increased attention to food evaluation methods (Demiray et al., 2019).
    The technique offers advantages over traditional manual methods (Fashi et al.,
    2019). Agriculture sector is one of the most important economic because it provides
    valuable rates of employment, GDP and non-oil exports, in addition to meeting
    the food needs of many countries. A major subsector of agricultural is horticulture,
    where the diversity and nutritional value of products is of importantance. Therefore,
    it is necessary to conduct scientific research to identify the influencing factors
    in this field. As it has often been the case, customers who care about healthy
    food prefer to buy fresh fruits. This makes it significant to guarantee the quality
    and availability of fruits all the year round. Over the past decade, the agri-food
    industry in general and the fruit sector in particular have considered supply
    chains as critical tools for competitiveness. Pomegranate is one of the favored
    fruits globally, and the demand for it and its derivatives is increasing. The
    popularity of pomegranate and the willingness of customers to pay for it have
    made producers turn to this market more than before, which has increased the global
    competition for pomegranate products. Some countries have established pomegranate-processing
    plants and generated income and employment through exports. The aim of proposed
    modeling is to minimize the cost and risk of the SC and maximize the profits of
    gardeners and investors in the public and Non-profit agriculture sectors in Iran.
    The research question are as follows: Where are distribution centers, recycling
    centers and factories established and how much is the flow between established
    centers? How to manage the severity of disruption or natural disasters, risk and
    uncertainty in the pomegranate SC? How to assess the relationship between appearance,
    color and size of pomegranate with artificial intelligence approaches?  The unique
    innovation of this paper as main contribution are as follows: Defining a sustainable
    multi-level CLSC including producers, distributors, customers, compost centers,
    compost customers, and factories, their customers in the field of food and energy
    production Considering image processing to determine the relationships among pomegranate
    appearance, color and size. Processing of pomegranate wastes, such as separating
    the peel from the other parts for conversion and reprocessing Considering the
    cost of using artificial intelligence for pest control in gardens and the cost
    of maintaining the processed products Using NSGA-II and MOPSO methods to solve
    the mathematical model and comparing the performance of them Considering risk
    and uncertainty in pomegranate supply chain in Iran This paper is organized in
    several sections. The theoretical foundations, literature review and research
    background are provided in the Sect. 2. In the third section addresses the mathematical
    model and its whole components designed for a pomegranate CLSC. A new solution
    to the mathematical model is presented in the Sect. 4. The Sect. 5 solves the
    model through the new solution method. Finally, the conclusion of the study and
    the suggestions for further study end up the paper. 2 Literature review The literature
    on SCM is very widely, but designing sustainable closed-loop networks has not
    received much attention in supply chain models (Patrício & Rieder, 2018). Recently,
    the fresh fruit sector in the agri-food industry has focused on CLSC only as a
    important concept for competitiveness (Mahajan et al., 2015). The idea of a CLSC
    has been around since at least the early industrial age, when merchants realized
    that old clothing, bedding, etc., could be repurposed into new textile products.
    The business emerged slowly and came to the fore in the 1980s, when environmental
    issues became a sensitive and significant issue. This led to the emergence of
    the \"general and hazardous\" waste processing and recycling business. A brief
    account of the most relevant studies in this regard is presented here. Based on
    the obtained knowledge, no study has been reported on sustainable closed-loop
    supply chains for pomegranate. 2.1 Agricultural SC A conventional SC for agricultural
    products consists of three components. The first part: sending the product from
    the farmer to the intermediate silos. The second component: sending from intermediate
    silos to conversion factories and the third component: sending from conversion
    factories to final customers. In each of the mentioned stages, various decisions
    are needed, and each decision may make the process of optimization and problem
    solving complicated. One of the first studies on various agricultural foods, both
    perishable and non-perishable, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables in SC was
    studied by Barbedo (2016). Integrated planning for the multifunctional manufacture
    and distribution of perishable products was also done by Hajiaghaei-Keshteli &
    Aminnayeri (2014). Another study (Ahumada & Villalobos, 2009) aimed at an optimal
    planning model of transporting fruit to logistics centers according to their demand
    in non-harvest seasons (Ahumada & Villalobos, 2009). The main aim and innovation
    of this paper is minimizig the cost of the SC. Numerous studies are still being
    done in this field. As some examples, one may refer to Amorim et al.(2012), Plà-Aragonés
    (2015), Carvajal et al. (2019), Cheraghalipour et al. (2019), Gholamian & Taghanzadeh
    (2017), Paydar et al. (2018), Alaoui et al. (2018), Sharma et al. (2020) and Kamble
    et al. (2020). To assess research gaps, a summary list of several other articles
    is provided in Table 1. In addition, for a detailed study of these articles, two
    charts are shown in Fig. 1. Chart (A) shows that 88% of these selected studies
    are single- and multi-objective. Based on Chart (B), however, it can be concluded
    that no study has been done on a pomegranate SC yet. Table 1 Comparison of the
    models reported in the literature for the SC of agricultural products study Full
    size table Fig. 1 Charts based on Table 1 Full size image Babatunde (2019) proposed
    an agricultural supply chain including emission reduction considerations and carbon
    taxes. They also allowed investment cooperation in their chain and designed a
    game theory (GT) model to compare different decisions and retailers’ benefit.
    In another study on agri-supply chain, Mukherjee et al. (2021) used the blockchain
    technology for sustainable development. They benefited from the opinions of managers
    in the agricultural sector regarding data privacy, decentralisation and smart
    contracts. Liu et al. (2021) presented a framework for the use of organic manure
    instead of chemical fertilizer, and concluded that an increase of subsidies would
    positively affect the use of organic manure. The benefits thus gained are important
    for the environment. Mukherjee et al. (2021) also applied a game theory in a blockchain
    to deal with the problem of an agricultural SC. The goal was to do about the sustainability
    in the operations of the chain. To test their model at a green level, they designed
    a numerical simulation and assesed the effect of the green policies on the evolution
    behaviour of the model. As it is clear from Table 1 and Fig. 1, there are few
    studies that systematically examine the pomegranate bi-level CLSC in a real case
    study according to sustainability criteria. In addition, few studies used image
    processing to determine the relationships among pomegranate appearance, color
    and size. 2.2 Farming with artificial intelligence (AI) Nowadays, the use of artificial
    intelligence (AL) is very critical for many problems that have a complex solution
    and require intelligent solutions. (Jiang et al., 2022). For instance, the diagnosis
    of fruit diseases is possible using modern image-processing technologies and machine
    learning. Banana production faces many diseases that cause great harm to poor
    farmers. With a modern image processing technology, these cases may be identified
    on time, and appropriate precautions may be taken to prevent further damage, thus
    enhancing healthy production (Song et al., 2022). Chen et al. (2021) designed
    a model and a framework to distribute fresh agricultural products using IoT technology.
    Generally, it is essential to make improvements in the production process, marketing
    and establishment of agricultural quality control systems and auxiliary measures
    to enter international markets. For this purpose, agricultural production can
    be mixed by information technology and Internet objective technology services
    (Bohle et al., 2010). In this study, image processing was used to determine the
    relationships among pomegranate appearance, color and size. Generally, the color
    and size of pomegranate fruit can be measured by removing its skin. Also, it is
    classified manually. Therefore, image processing and artificial intelligence have
    been developed to grade pomegranates based on their color and size (Hajiaghaei-Keshteli
    & Aminnayeri, 2014). In another study, a method was devised to identify pomegranates
    on a tree and find their total number using the close-up images taken in the corresponding
    garden. Since pomegranate has a noticeable red color, a color-based method can
    identify it on a tree (Fig. 2). The model for the pomegranate SC presented in
    current study considers the costs of using artificial intelligence in agriculture.
    Fig. 2 Identification of pomegranates on the tree using image processing Full
    size image In Fig. 2, the images are as follows: (a) Source image (pomegranate
    tree). (b) Black and white picture (segmentation, color indexing). (c) Picture
    after the applied threshold (figure analysis). (d) Location of geometric centers
    (estimated count of the pomegranates). 2.3 Risk and uncertanty in the SC Risks
    play a main role in making supply chains vulnerable and lowering their performance
    and competitive advantage (Asgari et al., 2013). There are some studies that have
    addressed this issue. Romero (2000) proposed an efficient cultivation model considering
    the producers'' risk. In another study (Vijayakumar & Balakrishnan, 2021), a bi-objective
    randomized CLSC network was designed, and the negative aspects of risks as a criterion
    were included in the objective functions. In the same line of research, risk criteria
    were integrated to a CLSC network design (Athiraja & Vijayakumar, 2021). A critical
    issue in a supply chain is resource constraints, which has been dealt with through
    product recycling. This is a process in reverse logistics through which products
    are collected from customer and carried to production centers to be recycled.
    Regarding the risks in this context, a study was conducted to define a CLSC for
    the motor oil sector (Chen et al., 2021). As it has also been shown (Fakhrzad
    et al., 2020), by considering an improved neural network and a rooted heuristic
    algorithm (RRA), the future demands of each product have been estimated based
    on the calculation of the product risk index. Some issues are affected by uncertainty
    in the SC. For example, regional political crises, demand changes, financial instability,
    strategy changes and natural disasters. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed
    to measure typical risks such as delivery delays, non-standard quality, natural
    disasters, and supplier’s financial risk (Romero, 2000). Supply uncertainty is
    due to the uncertainty of maturity, harvest time and performance. Demand uncertainty
    is the uncertainty in retailers’ weekly request. A method was proposed to determine
    the farming areas and the cultivation time of the annual plants that survive only
    for one raising season so as to maximize the total expected benefit (Fard et al.,
    2017). New SC network models were also designed with different decision criteria
    under combined uncertainties to reduce the expected total costs (Soleimani et
    al., 2014). Sriyanto et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of health system SCM in
    the COVID-19 pandemic times. They used the regression model to estimate the data
    in the future. The calculation results confirmed the existence of a relationship
    between the logistics efficiency index of the supply chains of health systems
    and the cases of COVID-19. Kumar et al. (2022) investigated the potential effect
    of Internet of Things (IoT) on the performance of the vaccine SC. To show the
    model validation, the state of Bihar in India has been selected. The results show
    that there is a positive relationship between the four components of the chain,
    including product, supply, demand and social behavior in adopting the Internet
    of Things. Alhawari et al. (2021) presented body of knowledge of circular economy
    supply chain literature by presenting a better understanding of the circular economy
    concepts by examining the different definitions. The results show that studies
    in the field of Industry 4.0 and circular economy, despite the fact that it has
    been highly regarded by analysts, but there are still study gaps for it. Usman
    et al. (2022) have studied a review study on the effect of weather change on the
    sustainability of supply chains of health systems. Based on this study, carbon
    and profit pricing indicators have been considered. The obtained results show
    that weather change predicts a positive impact on the decreasing trend of corona
    virus infection. Awan et al. (2022) investigated the value distribution factor
    in industrial revolution 4.0 and circular economy. The results show that value
    chain activities have a positive effect on industrial revolution 4.0 and circular
    economy. Ahmadi Choukolaei et al. (2021) presented a model for bioethanol consumption
    experienced due to unexpected worldwide event. Utilizing machine learning approaches
    to estimate the bioethanol demand was the main contributions of the paper. Designing
    sustainable bioethanol supply chain by two meta-heuristic algorithms are the main
    goal of their research. One of the most important practical aspects of this study
    is providing favorable policies like as determining the favorable location for
    facilities that are used in the network. In order to provide more information
    about the research in this area, some of the reviewed studies are itemized in
    Table 2. Table 2 Supply chain references itemized according to the applied uncertainty
    approaches and the types of risk Full size table According to the literature review
    mentioned above, the gaps identified for this study are stated as follows: Ignoring
    sustainability and concept of CLSC network in the field of food and energy production
    in the past research Ignoring image processing to determine the relationships
    among pomegranate appearance, color and size. Not paying attention to process
    of pomegranate wastes, such as separating the peel from the other parts Ignoring
    the cost of using artificial intelligence for pest control in gardens and the
    cost of maintaining the processed products Ignoring the use of metaheuristic methods
    to solve the mathematical model and comparing the performance of them Not paying
    attention to risk and uncertainty in pomegranate supply chain in Iran 3 Problem
    definition Current paper proposes a design for a CLSC of supplying pomegranates.
    The corresponding logistics network is designed for several periods and covers
    manufacturers, distribution centers, customers, factories, recycling sites (compost
    sites), and compost sites (compost markets). As depicted in Fig. 3, goods are
    shipped from the producer to the consumer, distribution centers and factories
    in the forward flow. In the considered network, fruits are produced as products
    in a forward flow during three periods, which are the maximum time of mass production
    periods. In this flow, the customers also receive their goods from the distribution
    centers, and the demands are met by the manufacturer. Distribution centers ship
    products within the eight time periods that are assumed to be the maximum storage
    time. The fruit demand period is eight months too. Besides, the customer locations
    are considered fixed. Fig. 3 Flowchart of the proposed CLSC Full size image The
    factories in the supply chain obtain the fruit they need from the producers and
    the distribution centers in the forward part of the chain. A factory consists
    of a food and pharmaceutical sector that serves to prepare the products and send
    them to the market. Another feature of this chain is the processing of pomegranate
    wastes, such as seperating the peel from the other parts for conversion and reprocessing.
    As Fig. 4 shows, ethanol can be extracted from pomegranate peel and the other
    components of the fruit waste (Paydar et al., 2017); one of the applications of
    this extract is in car fuel production (Barbedo, 2016; Mahajan et al., 2015).
    Fig. 4 Process of extracting bioethanol from pomegranate wastes Full size image
    Rotten fruits on trees transmit their pests to other fruits. To prevent the spread
    of pests to the whole garden, the spoiled fruit is identified by image processing
    and artificial intelligence and carried out of the garden to compost centers.
    The returned fruit is sent to vermicompost centers, converted into organic fertilizers,
    and transferred to compost customers in the reverse flow. Since the producers
    (orchards) can be the customers of fertilizers as well, the network is considered
    as a supply chain of cyclic packages where the producers are the same as the compost
    customers (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Flow of the returned pomegranate and its conversion
    to vermicompost Full size image Millions of tons of biowaste are dumped or incinerated
    every year, which causes many environmental problems and imposes enormous costs
    of transporting, disposing, and incinerating the wastes. One of the main ways
    to reuse organic material waste is to transform it into vermicomposting. Therefore,
    in addition to the production of vermicomposting organic fertilizer, which has
    many advantages, it is effective in preserving the environment and the health
    of society. This useful organic bio fertilizer is obtained through the digestive
    system of a special earthworm. (Goli et al., 2019; Mostafaeipour et al., 2017;
    Tan & Çömden, 2012). 4 Problem modelling This section introduces the indices,
    parameters and decision variables of the problem and then describes the proposed
    multi-objective optimization (MOO). MOO is built according to definition of the
    problem and takes into account certain assumptions. Its objectives are to reduce
    the SC costs (i.e., costs of transportation, construction of potential locations
    for distribution centers, inventory maintenance, production in gardens, and processing),
    to minimize the risks involved and to maximize the demand response. 4.1 Indicators  \\(i=1,

    including cost minimization, risk reduction and accountability maximization. Equation
    (1) deals with the minimization of the costs, which consist of five types of costs
    presented in Eqs. (2) to (6). Equation (2) addresses the fixed costs of implementation
    the distribution, recycling and manufacturing centers. It should be noted that
    distribution and recycling centers can be both actual and potential points. To
    make it possible, rather than the addition of an index, the cost of constructing
    actual points is assumed to be zero in the parameters. Equations (3)–(5) are respectively
    concerned with the following: Transportation costs (comprising forward and backward
    costs) The cost of using artificial intelligence for pest control in gardens The
    cost of maintaining the processed products Equation (6) regards operating costs,
    including the costs of energy, processing, packaging, reprocessing as well as
    food industries. Equation (7) defines other function, which is to decrease the
    risk in the chain by considering the cost of reducing the risk of supplying the
    product. It is possible to determine the magnitude of the risk by multiplying
    the severity, frequency rate and probability of the chain disorder, as three indicators.
    Equation (8) defines the third objective function, namely accountability maximization.
    In this regard, the response is divided into two parts. The first Pertains to
    the customers of the main product, and second concerns the customers of the processed
    product as well as the food and energy conversion industries. 4.5 Constraints

    role in the mathematical model. Constraint (9) shows that the producers minus
    wastes equal the transfer from those producers to the distributors, target markets
    and factories. Constraint (10) is related to constraint (9) and emphasizes that
    shipments to potential distributors will occur if the site is established. Constraint
    (11) indicates that the amount of the product manufactured by smaller producers
    is equal to their maximum capacity. Limitation (12) ensure that the distributor’s
    inventory in each time equals the inventory in the previous time minus the waste
    of the previous time plus the new products entering the storage minus the outgoing
    products from the storage to the processing and packaging lines and factories.
    Constraint (13) states that the maximum inventory of distributors is smaller or
    equal to the storage capacity. Limitation (14) means that the market request value
    in each time is greater or equal to the products of the plants and distributors.
    Constraints (15) to (24) indicate that the amount of the waste in each section
    of a reverse flow is displayed if recycling centers are established. Constraints
    (25) to (30) denote that the inputs from such sectors as production, distribution,
    fruit markets and customers are sent to factories including manufacturers as well
    as food and energy industries.Constraint (31) signifies that the total input sent
    from the production and distribution centers as well as fruit markets and customers
    to the factory multiplied by the conversion rate of the processed products in
    the factory is equal to the total products sent to the market from food and energy
    production plants. Constraint (32) implies that the total output of factories
    sent to the customer or market is less than or equal to the production volume
    of food and energy plants. Constraints (33) and (34) assume that all the products
    of a factory sent to a smaller factory or market are equal to customer demand
    and the market capacity of the food and energy factory. Accordingly, constraint
    (33) is related to the capacity of food factories as well as their market demand
    and customers. Constraint (34), however, is about the capacity of energy factories
    as well as their market demand and customers. Constraint (35) shows the total
    waste sent to recycling centers from producers, distributors, customers and factories,
    multiplying the conversion of waste products to compost. It is equal to the total
    recycled product sent to markets and compost customers. Constraint (36) states
    that all the compost sent to the compost market and smaller customers is equal
    to the production capacity of recycling centers. Limitation (37) marks that all
    the compost sent to the compost market and smaller customers is equal to the demand
    of the compost user. Limitation (38) assumes that the risk of providing the product
    from the supplier is multiplied if it is less than or equal to the maximum risk
    allowed to produce the product. Constraint (39) states that the total output of
    the orchards that goes to the distribution centers, fruit markets or customers,
    factories and compost is smaller than the maximum products of the orchards. Equations
    (40) to (42) represent the last constraints. They include the signs of free variables
    (zero and one for variables) and their positivity. 5 Numerical problems The results
    of the current study are described in 5 steps. First, the necessary details for
    the mathematical model are provided. Then, all numerical parameters used in this
    research are introduced. In the third stage, the deterministic and meta-heuristic
    finding of the model are shown. In the following, meta-heuristic methods are compared
    with each other. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on the most influential parameters
    of the model is presented. In general, the present study is a multi-objective
    localization modeling. To solve this problem, a number of variables that accept
    zero or one value have been used. These binary variables cause complexity in the
    model (Tan et al., 2019). Generally, realistic case study have large dimensions,
    and the corresponding models become NP-hard as those dimensions grow. According
    to the complexity of the presented model in this study, exact methods such as
    the epsilon constrained method are not efficient enough (Saleem et al., 2020).
    To solve the mathematical model in this study, a meta-heuristic algorithm is used
    as the solution method, and Pareto solutions are found by NSGA-II as a multi-objective
    non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. This research has also sought to design
    a multi-level closed-loop network including producers, distributors, customers,
    compost centers, compost customers, and factories, their customers in the field
    of food and energy production. The designed network serves to supply pomegranates
    to the cities and provinces in Iran. Figure 6 shows the map of the cities and
    provinces with the most pomegranate orchards. Fig. 6 Map of Iran: the provinces
    with the largest areas under pomegranate cultivation Full size image For this
    purpose, the production capacities of different regions of Iran are examined,
    the number of the distribution centers in each region is identified, and their
    relationship with consumption centers is established. Distance, product quality,
    cost, and region capacity effectively determine the number of distribution centers
    and their relation to consumption centers. As a result, identifying the regions
    and determining the number of centers and the required distribution and transportation
    routes are the most important problems facing this research. In this study, 12
    problems in different dimensions have been dealt with. The data on the dimensions
    of the problems are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Dimensions of the problem Full size
    table The first sub-problem is the realistic study in current research, which
    is used to show model and method validation. The cities selected for each location
    in this case are mentioned in Table 4. The values of φ, ρ and Mʼ are considered
    to be 1.1, 0.6 and 1015. The value of cp’ is assumed to be equal to 180. Table

    are presented in Table 5. Table 5 The values of the remaining model parameters
    Full size table 6 Computational results 6.1 Solving numerical problems After the
    parameters are specified in the numerical problems, the NSGA-II and multi-objective
    PSO algorithms are implemented and the solution results of the generated problems
    are compared. Thus, the 12 problems introduced in the previous section are examined
    first by the GAMS software and then by the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms. Table
    6 presents the objective function values and the CPU time of the experimental
    examples conduct by GAMS®. GAMS can solve small-size problems. When the size of
    the problems is increased, however, it cannot achieve acceptable solutions within
    reasonable time. In this case, only numerical problems 1 to 6 can be solved and
    yield optimal solutions. From problem 7 on, GAMS is not capable of solving, and
    the solutions are zero. Table 6 Computational results for 12 problems in the GAMS
    software Full size table Since the GAMS software can only solve low-size problems,
    more powerful solution methods have been needed in this study. In this regard,
    the NSGA-II algorithm has served the purpose very well. The feasible solution
    obtain finding are shown in Table 7. As indicated, the bigger the problem, the
    higher the total cost and risk, and the lower the accountability (e.g., objective
    function 3). It also takes more time to solve bigger-size problems, which is denoted
    as the CPU time. Table 7 Computational results for 12 problems by NSGA-II Full
    size table In addition, to compare the performances of different solution methods
    here, multi-objective PSO is used as another meta-heuristic algorithm. Table 8
    presents the computational results for different problems solved by the MOPSO
    algorithm. As it can be seen, raising in the size of a problem leads to raise
    in the total cost and risk. Furthermore, the bigger a problem, the lower its objective
    function of accountability and the higher the CPU time. Table 8 Computational
    results for 12 problems by MOPSO Full size table The results yielded by different
    solution algorithms are compared in Fig. 7. It can be concluded that the NSGA-II
    algorithm involves lower costs than the other two methods. The next ranks in this
    respect are for the MOPSO algorithm and the GAMS software respectively. Fig. 7
    Objective function 1 for the numerical problems by three solution methods Full
    size image The solution algorithms applied in this study are also compared in
    Fig. 8. As it can be concluded, the lower-size problems solved by the GAMS software
    emerge to have lower supply risks than conducted by the NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms.
    Moreover, for bigger-size problems, NSGA-II has proved to perform better than
    the MOPSO algorithm. Fig. 8 Objective function 2 for the numerical problems by
    three solution methods Full size image By comparing the three solution methods,
    one understands that solving problems by the NSGA-II algorithm results in higher
    accountability. The next two ranks in this respect belong to MOPSO and GAMS, respectively
    (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Objective function 3 for the numerical problems by three solution
    methods Full size image In terms of the running time, as Fig. 10 shows, it takes
    more CPU time to solve low-size problems in the GAMS software than by the other
    solution methods. For big-size problems, however, the MOPSO algorithm takes less
    CPU time than the NSGA-II algorithm. Fig. 10 CPU time for the numerical problems
    in the NSGA-II and GAMS® Full size image 6.2 Sensitivity analysis In this section,
    the validity and treatment of the model are examined through changing different
    parameters including the maximum supply risk (\\({\\widetilde{MSR}}_{pt}\\)),
    period of natural disasters or disruption from the supplier (\\({\\widetilde{RV}}_{it}\\)),
    severity of disruption or natural disasters for the crop \\(({\\widetilde{R\\varphi
    }}_{pt}\\)), and frequency rate of crop failure or natural disasters for the product
    \\(({\\widetilde{R\\theta }}_{pit}\\)). As the graphs in Fig. 11 show, a rise
    in the maximum supply risk leads to a rise in the total cost and risk but a reduction
    in the accountability of the network. Fig. 11 The treatment of the objective functions
    versus the maximum supply risk Full size image Graphs in Fig. 12 indicate that
    an increase in the disruption period results in increased total cost and risk
    of the network, while it first increases and then decreases the accountability.
    Fig. 12 The treatment of the objective functions versus the increased disruption
    period Full size image According to Fig. 13, once the severity of disruption is
    increased in the OF1, the total cost of the network is increased too, and the
    total risk rises at a constant rate. In contrast, the accountability is first
    reduced, then increased, and finally reduced linearly. Fig. 13 The treatment of
    the objective functions versus the increased severity of disruption Full size
    image As for results in Fig. 14, an increase in the frequency rate of failure,
    namely OF1 keeps the total cost of the network stable but then increases it. The
    total risk is also increased linearly at a constant rate. The accountability,
    however, rises at first and then decreases. Fig. 14 The treatment of the objective
    functions versus the increased frequency of failure Full size image 7 Conclusion
    In current study, a MOO modeling is presented for a sustainable CLSC. The reverse
    logistic operations in the chain, such as waste recycling, are intended to reduce
    the energy consumption and cost of the network. To test and validatef the designed
    problem, a case study has been conducted on pomegranates in Iran. As designed
    in the supply chain, the fruit is turned into food, medicine, and concentrate
    after supply and distribution. Through reverse logistics, the pomegranate waste
    is also converted into recycled products including ethanol as an automotive fuel
    and a renewable source of energy and compost as an organic fertilizer. The image
    processing approach can be useful as a fast, economic, non-contact method (without
    human intervention) and with a much higher accuracy than visual and manual inspection
    methods, in controlling the quality of pomegranate production lines. Therefore,
    the costs of the chain are reduced to a great extent because automation reduces
    transportation costs and personnel wages. The use of picture processing in the
    diagnosis of pomegranate quality ensures compliance with international standards.
    Also, defective products and waste have always been an important challenge for
    manufacturers. Pomegranate recycling and reprocessing and reuse of products not
    only reduce harmful effects for the environment, but also improve their competitive
    sittuation in the market. Therefore, in current study, considering the CLSC, it
    is possible to significantly reconstruct the supply chain networks and maximize
    the economic benefits. This structure can achieve the economic, social and environmental
    goals of the organization at the same time. Therefore, the finding of this study
    can be useful for organizations and managers who deal with crops, food, and in
    general, products that have the possibility of failure. Considering image processing
    to determine the relationships among pomegranate appearance, color and size, cost
    of using artificial intelligence for pest control in gardens and the cost of maintaining
    the processed products and risk and uncertainty in pomegranate SC are the unique
    contributions of current study. The basis goal of current modeling is to decrease
    the cost and risk of the SC and increase the profits of gardeners and investors
    in the public and non-profit agriculture sectors in Iran. To solve the problem
    of the mathematical model, NSGA-II and MOPSO are used as two meta-heuristic algorithms.
    The problem is also solved with the GAMS software, and the finding of the three
    solutions are compared. By the analysis of the computational findings, it is reported
    that the NSGA-II algorithm has better mechanism than the other solution methods
    to reduce the total cost and the supply risk and enhance the accountability. Finally,
    to examin the behaviour of modeling, a series of sensitivity analyses are conducted
    on the parameters of maximum supply risk, disruption period, frequency of failure
    and disruption risk. Results show that once the severity of disruption is increased
    in OF1 total cost of the network is increased too, and the total risk rises at
    a constant rate. In contrast, the accountability is first reduced, then increased,
    and finally reduced linearly. Also an increase in the frequency rate of failure,
    namely the first objective function, keeps the total cost of the network stable
    but then increases it. The total risk is also increased linearly at a constant
    rate. The accountability, however, rises at first and then decreases. Momenitabar
    et al. (2022a) presented sustainable CLSC network considering lateral resupply.
    They using fuzzy system is used to predict the demand in the system. Considering
    image processing to determine the relationships among pomegranate appearance,
    color and size, and cost of using artificial intelligence for pest control in
    gardens are the contribution of current research compared with the one done by
    Momenitabar et al. (2022a). Babaeinesami et al. (2022) presented a CLSC combination
    considering environmental effects. They used a self-adaptive NSGA-II algorithm
    to solve the proposed problem. Considering risk and uncertainty and image processing
    to determine the relationships among pomegranate appearance, color and size are
    the contribution of current research compared with the one done by Babaeinesami
    et al. (2022). Safaei et al. (2022) presented a new 2EMPCLSC network. In this
    paper, demand forecasting is done using time series modeling. They run the model
    using genetic algorithm. Considering the cost of using artificial intelligence
    for pest control in gardens and the cost of maintaining the processed products
    and image processing to determine the relationships among pomegranate appearance,
    color and size are the contribution of current study compared with the one done
    by Safaei et al. (2022). Current study has some limitatation follow as: The solutions
    in NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms depend on the type of definition of chromosomes
    as well as the initialization of their parameters. If there is a change in their
    value, the results of the research will change. Due to the fact that there was
    no database to record documents and data, questions have been designed to collect
    transportation costs in each route. Then, the collected data is used in the mathematical
    model.  Also, some suggustion for future study are follow as: Considering the
    fuzzy set system to predict the amount of uncertain demand for pomegranate Considering
    the proposed model as a scenario-based model and solving it with a robust optimization
    approach Considering a cooperative game between pomegranate producers and the
    government using a game theory approach Data Availability Data will be made available

  description: Microbiomes interact dynamically with their environment to perform
    exploitable functions such as production of valuable metabolites and degradation
    of toxic metabolites for a wide range of applications in human health, agriculture,
    and environmental cleanup. Developing computational models to predict the key
    bacterial species and environmental factors to build and optimize such functions
    are crucial to accelerate microbial community engineering. However, there is an
    unknown web of interactions that determine the highly complex and dynamic behavior
    of these systems, which precludes the development of models based on known mechanisms.
    By contrast, entirely data-driven machine learning models can produce physically
    unrealistic predictions and often require significant amounts of experimental
    data to learn system behavior. We develop a physically-constrained recurrent neural
    network that preserves model flexibility but is constrained to produce physically
    consistent predictions and show that it can outperform existing machine learning
    methods in the prediction of certain experimentally measured species abundance
    and metabolite concentrations. Further, we present a closed-loop, Bayesian experimental
    design algorithm to guide data collection by selecting experimental conditions
    that simultaneously maximize information gain and target microbial community functions.
    Using a bioreactor case study, we demonstrate how the proposed framework can be
    used to efficiently navigate a large design space to identify optimal operating
    conditions. The proposed methodology offers a flexible machine learning approach
    specifically tailored to optimize microbiome target functions through the sequential
    design of informative experiments that seek to explore and exploit community functions.

    agriculture, and environmental cleanup. Developing computational models to predict
    the key bacterial species and environmental factors to build and optimize such

    framework can be used to efficiently navigate a large design space to identify
    optimal operating conditions. The proposed methodology offers a flexible machine
    learning approach specifically tailored to optimize microbiome target functions
    through the sequential design of informative experiments that seek to explore
    and exploit community functions. Author summary The functions performed by microbiomes
    hold tremendous promise to address grand challenges facing society ranging from
    improving human health to promoting plant growth. To design their properties,
    flexible computational models that can predict the temporally changing behaviors
    of microbiomes in response to key environmental parameters are needed. When considering
    a bottom-up design of microbiomes, the number of possible communities grows exponentially
    with the number of organisms and environmental factors, which makes it challenging
    to navigate the microbiome function landscape. To overcome these challenges, we
    present a physically-constrained machine learning model for microbiomes and a
    closed-loop, Bayesian experimental design framework to efficiently navigate the
    space of possible communities and environmental factors. Figures    Citation:

    have the potential to perform a variety of functions, including the ability to
    convert carbon-rich waste products into valuable compounds [1, 2], perform biological
    nitrogen fixation to improve agricultural yields [3], detoxify waste from the
    environment [4], and modulate vertebrate host phenotypes [5]. However, designing
    microbial communities from the bottom-up to perform desired functions is a major
    challenge due to unknown mechanisms of interaction and limited ability to observe
    and quantify all aspects of such systems (e.g. metabolites utilized and produced
    by constituent community members). Further, the design space of species and environmental
    factors for optimizing a microbiome target function is large and difficult to
    systematically navigate. Developing models that predict the temporal behaviors
    of communities from data and identify environmental conditions and combinations
    of species predicted to have optimized functions has emerged as a promising avenue
    to direct microbiome engineering [6]. Because microbiomes have large design spaces,
    high-throughput experiments coupled to computational modeling can be powerful
    for understanding and engineering microbial communities from the bottom-up [7–9].
    Mathematical models that predict system behavior have become essential tools to
    understand complex biological processes [10], and recent studies have successfully
    applied a model guided approach to understand and optimize microbial community
    functions [5, 9]. Developing models of the microbiome from first-principles is
    difficult due to unknown interactions as well as a limited understanding of the
    mechanisms that underlie these interactions [11]. Machine learning methods that
    can learn how microbial species interact in different environments from experimental
    data are thus compelling approaches to address this limitation. Neural networks
    are flexible machine learning models that can predict complex behavior for a broad
    class of systems [12]. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular, are powerful
    neural network architectures that can exploit multivariate time series data to
    learn dynamic behaviors [13]. For example, Baranwal et al. [14] showed that RNNs
    could model microbial community dynamics with greater accuracy than standard ecological
    models that are confined by a strict set of assumptions, such as the generalized
    Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model. In addition to improved prediction performance of
    species growth dynamics, the model was able to accurately forecast the production
    of health relevant metabolites given an initial profile of species abundances.
    In addition, an RNN model trained on time series measurements of human gut microbiome
    composition data tailored for classification of food allergy achieved the best
    prediction accuracy compared to other machine learning methods [15]. While highly
    flexible, key limitations of applying machine learning models such as RNNs to
    physical systems include unrealistic predictions (e.g. negative species abundances)
    and significant amounts of experimental data for training. Machine learning models
    are capable of making unrealistic predictions when the training data set (i.e.
    data used to build the model) is insufficient to constrain the model to match
    system behavior. Physically constrained machine learning models are especially
    promising for modeling biological systems [16] because these constraints can potentially
    improve a model’s ability to extrapolate beyond the regime explored in the training
    set despite limited or noisy data [17, 18]. In the computational biology field,
    for instance, neural networks have been used in concert with mechanistic ordinary
    differential equation (ODE) models for system identification of hidden dynamics
    of experimentally unobserved variables in biological systems [19]. In addition
    to incorporating physical constraints, experimental design strategies that optimize
    the information content of experimental data can reduce the amount of data needed
    to train a predictive model. The collection of data used to inform machine learning
    models requires taking measurements of system properties, which is often time-consuming
    and expensive. Consequently, the selection of an informative set of experiments
    is crucial for developing models that capture system properties, while minimizing
    time and resources spent on performing experiments [20]. To achieve this goal,
    determining an optimal set of experiments that minimizes either model prediction
    uncertainty or uncertainty in parameter estimates has been widely used to optimize
    the information content of experiments for studying biological systems [21–24].
    Bayesian experimental design naturally integrates previously observed data to
    inform the selection of new experimental conditions. This enables a sequential
    strategy that uses all previously collected data to inform future iterations of
    model fitting, experimental design, and data acquisition. These approaches use
    acquisition functions that aim to quantify information content and predict system
    performance under potential sets of experiments. A widely used acquisition function
    is called the expected information gain (EIG), which quantifies how well an experimental
    design is expected to constrain estimates of model parameters [24–26]. While the
    EIG provides a principled acquisition function to design new experimental conditions,
    it is typically intractable to compute analytically for nonlinear models and can
    be computationally expensive to evaluate when approximate approaches such as Monte
    Carlo sampling [27] are used. While most applications of Bayesian experimental
    design have focused on conducting experiments to refine a model, experimental
    design strategies have rarely been used in the field of systems biology for the
    purpose of seeking conditions that optimize properties of the system (e.g. production
    of a valuable compound or pathogen inhibition) for target applications. However,
    Bayesian experimental design can be tailored to provide a powerful goal-oriented
    framework that can leverage a flexible class of models to propose experimental
    conditions that have the dual objective of mitigating model uncertainty and optimizing
    system performance [25, 28]. For example, Bayesian optimization is a closed-loop
    experimental design technique whose purpose is to efficiently optimize system
    properties and has been used in many fields ranging from synthetic biology [29]
    to aerospace engineering [30]. Bayesian optimization typically uses a non-parametric
    Gaussian process model to predict system performance directly from experimental
    data. While Gaussian process models provide a natural and computationally-tractable
    approach to construct acquisition functions [31], they cannot easily model the
    dynamic behavior of multivariate systems [32]. Another widely used goal-oriented
    experimental design strategy is called response surface methodology, which proposes
    experiments to build a performance function that is optimized to find the best
    operating conditions. However, this approach is typically limited to linear models
    [33] and experimental designs are based on rigidly defined structures [34]. We
    address gaps in model-guided experimental design of microbial communities by developing
    and applying a physically-constrained RNN architecture tailored to predict microbial
    community dynamics and target functions (e.g. production of specific metabolites)
    in response to environmental inputs. The proposed model outperforms other representative
    machine learning methods in the prediction of species abundances and metabolite
    concentrations using experimental data composed of unique human gut communities
    (> 10 species). Equipped with this model, we present a closed-loop, Bayesian experimental
    design framework to optimize microbial community functions that leverages an information
    theoretic approach to select a set of experimental conditions that collectively
    exploit system functions and fill knowledge gaps in the model. We demonstrate
    the capability of the overall framework to minimize the number of experiments
    necessary to identify optimal operating conditions that maximize production of
    a desired metabolite using a mechanistic multi-species microbial community model.
    To our knowledge, our framework is the first to integrate sequential Bayesian
    experimental design to optimize dynamic system behaviors using a RNN based model.
    Furthermore, we present a novel RNN architecture that is specifically tailored
    to capture microbiome behaviors and process microbiome data. 2 Results 2.1 Design
    of microbial communities using a physically constrained recurrent neural network
    Machine learning models can generate physically unrealistic predictions for physical
    systems. To address this limitation, we present the Microbiome Recurrent Neural
    Network (MiRNN), a modified RNN architecture that eliminates the possibility of
    predicting physically unrealistic species abundances and metabolite concentrations
    (S1 Fig). We leverage a Bayesian inference method for parameter estimation, hyper-parameter
    optimization, and quantification of prediction uncertainty. A model-guided approach
    is used to identify a set of experimental conditions that collectively maximize
    information content of different experimental designs and design objectives. Our
    closed-loop framework allows for the selection of an optimal set of experimental
    conditions that are collectively informative, as opposed to the selection of a
    single experimental condition, enabling design of high-throughput experiments.
    The proposed methodology is illustrated in Fig 1. In the design phase, the MiRNN
    is combined with an acquisition function, f, to rank experimental designs based
    on predicted outcomes and the expected information gain (EIG) from a space of
    all possible experimental conditions, denoted as . The acquisition function is
    composed of two parts, one that quantifies the expected profit (i.e. exploitation)
    of an experimental design and one that quantifies the information content (i.e.
    exploration) of an experimental design. The highest ranked design, , is tested
    to generate experimental data in the test phase. The resulting data is used to
    update the MiRNN model in the learn phase. The updated model is used to design
    the next experiment, completing the design, test, learn (DTL) cycle. DTL cycles
    can be repeated until convergence or until a desired objective is achieved. Download:

    Recurrent Neural Network (MiRNN) learns system dynamics and proposes new designs.
    (Design) An experimental design space, denoted as , is a set of individual experimental
    conditions, q, where a particular condition could, for example, be a set of species
    in a community or the initial concentrations of resources. MiRNN predictions of
    outcomes for a set of experimental conditions, q, are evaluated by an acquisition
    function, f, which balances the expected information gain (EIG) of an experimental
    design and its expected profit to evaluate the optimality of experimental designs.
    (Test) The optimal experimental design, q*, defines a set of experimental conditions
    to be observed experimentally. Measurements of these conditions are collected
    in the test phase. (Learn) Data collected in the test phase, and all previously
    collected data, are used to fit an updated MiRNN model. Once fit to the newly
    acquired data, the updated MiRNN model can be used again in the design phase to
    complete the design, test, learn cycle. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011436.g001
    2.2 Comparison of the Microbiome Recurrent Neural Network (MiRNN) model to an
    unconstrained recurrent neural network Microbiome data of both synthetic and natural
    microbiomes are often sparse, meaning that most taxa are absent from community
    samples depending on the phylogenetic resolution [35]. The constraint embedded
    in the MiRNN is designed to account for this sparsity when making predictions
    of microbial community dynamics. Mirroring recurrent neural network based models
    [14], the MiRNN takes as input an initial condition of known species abundances
    and predicts future time points autoregressively. This involves making predictions
    at each time step, which in turn are model inputs to predict the next time step.
    Therefore, it is important that the model does not erroneously predict the emergence
    of an absent species at any step, since the error could propagate into predictions
    of subsequent time points. To prevent physically unrealistic predictions, the
    MiRNN includes a constraint that forces zero abundance species to remain zero
    at later time points and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) output activation that
    ensures species and metabolite predictions are non-negative. In contrast, an entirely
    unconstrained model could predict negative species abundances and metabolite concentrations
    or spontaneous appearance of species that were not initially present (S2 Fig).
    To demonstrate the utility of the constraint, we compared the MiRNN to an unconstrained
    RNN, which did not include the constraint to prevent the emergence of absent species
    (Fig 2A). All other aspects, including the ReLU output activation and the training
    algorithm (Algorithm 1), were exactly the same between the two models. We constructed
    a ground truth bioreactor model (Methods) of 20 species competing for 10 resources
    and considered three different simulated data sets: (1) 50 randomly selected community
    combinations of 5 of the 20 possible species (most sparse), (2) 50 combinations
    of 10 of the 20 possible species (intermediate sparsity), and (3) 50 combinations
    of 15 of the 20 possible species (least sparse). For each community combination,
    the ground truth model was simulated over a time span of 130 hours with observations
    of species abundances taken every 26 hours for a total of 5 time point measurements
    (Fig 2B). To investigate differences in prediction performance of the MiRNN and
    RNN models, we performed 10-fold cross-validation by randomly partitioning the
    data into 10 unique sets of samples, training on 9 subsets, testing on the remaining
    subset, and then repeating for each combination of training and testing data so
    that all samples were subject to held-out testing. Because the partitioning of
    the data subsets is random, we repeated cross-validation over 5 trials to evaluate
    the variation in prediction performance. We note that evaluations of prediction
    performance only consider predictions of species that were initially present,
    so that predictions of absent species do not bias benchmarks of model prediction
    performance in favor of the MiRNN. The MiRNN outperformed the RNN in terms of
    the average Pearson correlation and RMSE of predicted species abundances (Fig
    2C and 2D) in all three data sets. Both models became increasingly more accurate
    as the sparsity reduced, highlighting the importance of models that account for
    sparsity in microbiome data. These results demonstrate that constraining absent
    species to remain zero at future time steps improved the MiRNN’s prediction accuracy
    of species that were initially present, making the MiRNN specifically tailored
    to process sparse microbiome data. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image

    Microbiomes produce and degrade a myriad of metabolites, which mediate interactions
    with constituent community members and can be exploited to our benefit. To test
    the ability of the MiRNN to predict species abundance and metabolite concentration
    over time, we evaluated the model’s prediction performance on experimental data
    in which the absolute abundances of 25 diverse and prevalent human gut species
    and the concentrations of four major health-relevant metabolites (acetate, butyrate,
    lactate and succinate) were measured over time [9, 14] (Fig 3A). In particular,
    butyrate produced by gut microbiota has beneficial effects on human health and
    disease, including promoting homeostasis in the colon [36, 37] and protecting
    against metabolic disorders [38]. The ability to predict metabolite concentrations
    such as butyrate as a function of the initial abundance could inform the design
    of next-generation defined bacterial therapeutics. To test our model’s predictive
    capability, we used an experimental data set consisting of 95 unique subsets of
    the 25 member community that were inoculated in equal species proportions in vitro.
    Species abundances and metabolite concentrations were measured every 16 hours
    for a total of 48 hours to characterize community assembly and metabolite dynamics.

    in each trial. (d.) Same as in panel (c.), except that metabolite prediction performance

    To investigate differences in prediction performance of the MiRNN and RNN models
    (Fig 3B), we performed 10 trials of 20-fold cross-validation by randomly partitioning
    the data into 20 unique sets of samples, training on 19 subsets and testing on
    the remaining subset. This was repeated for each combination of training and testing
    data so that all samples were subject to held-out testing. On held-out data, MiRNN
    predictions of species abundances that were initially present displayed a higher
    median Pearson correlation than the unconstrained RNN for 21 of the 25 species
    (Fig 3C), indicating that the incorporation of a physical constraint significantly
    improved the model’s ability to predict species abundance (sign test, p < 1 ×
    10−3, n = 25). Although the constraint does not directly impact predictions of
    metabolite concentrations, the MiRNN outperformed the RNN in predictions of acetate
    and succinate. The MiRNN and RNN displayed similar prediction performance of lactate
    and butyrate, which displayed the highest prediction performance of the four metabolites
    (Fig 3D). A representative trajectory shows the predicted distribution (mean ±
    1 standard deviation) of each metabolite compared to measured values (Fig 3E).
    We also compared the prediction performance of the MiRNN to a consumer resource
    (CR) model [39] and to the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model developed by Baranwal
    et al. [14]. The LSTM model was previously shown to accurately predict community
    dynamics and metabolite profiles using the same data presented in Fig 2. Implementation
    details of the CR model are provided in S1 Appendix. While the CR model offers
    the same physical constraints as the MiRNN, it lacks the flexibility of machine
    learning approaches since it assumes species dynamics are entirely governed by
    constant rates of competition and metabolite sharing of resources. Similar to
    the MiRNN, the LSTM offers greater flexiblity than the CR model due to the neural
    network architecture. The flexibility of neural network based models is governed
    by the number and dimension of hidden layers, which for the LSTM was chosen by
    Baranwal et al. to have a single hidden layer with 4096 nodes in order to predict
    both species abundances and metabolite concentrations. For all analyses in this
    study, the MiRNN and RNN use a single hidden layer with 16 units. Consequently,
    the LSTM proposed by Baranwal et al. when applied to a system with 25 species
    and 4 metabolites contains orders of magnitude more parameters (nθ = 67, 735,
    581) than the MiRNN and RNN (nθ = 1, 245), and thus offers greater flexibility.
    However, the large number of model parameters in the LSTM model makes it challenging
    to perform the Bayesian parameter inference method used to train the MiRNN and
    RNN models [40], because this requires the computationally expensive task of inverting
    a matrix with dimension equal to the square of the number of parameters [12].
    Therefore, alternative approaches for approximate Bayesian inference [40, 41]
    would need to be developed to apply the LSTM model for Bayesian optimization or
    experimental design. While the MiRNN did not outperform the LSTM on held out data
    from 20-fold cross-validation, the MiRNN displayed a higher median Pearson correlation
    for 22 of the 25 species (sign test, p < 1 × 10−4, n = 25) and for all four metabolites
    compared to the CR model (S3 Fig). To determine whether reducing the size of the
    training data favors the simpler CR model, we scanned a range of training sizes
    from 1 to 70 samples and found that all machine learning methods outperformed
    the CR model across this range (S4 Fig). In summary, the combined flexibility
    of the MiRNN and the incorporation of the physical constraint improved performance
    over both a mechanistic CR model and the unconstrained RNN model. Furthermore,
    reducing the number of parameters of machine learning approaches makes Bayesian
    inference methods tractable and thus enables a systematic method to determine
    model prediction uncertainty and optimize experimental designs. We evaluated the
    quality of MiRNN prediction uncertainty on held-out data, since the ability to
    identify poorly understood conditions is crucial for selecting informative experimental
    designs that aim to fill knowledge gaps in the model. Evaluation of the log-likelihood
    of held-out testing data is a widely used approach to demonstrate a model’s ability
    to use prediction uncertainty to capture the variation in prediction error [42,
    43]. Briefly, the log-likelihood (Eq 3) of held-out data will be higher when model
    predicted uncertainty is small for predictions that are close to measured values
    and when model prediction uncertainty is large for predictions that are further
    away from measured values (S5 Fig). We compared the log-likelihood of held-out
    data using a null model where the uncertainty in each prediction was estimated
    using a fixed variance, Σy, to the log-likelihood using the condition-dependent
    model predicted variance given by Eq 9. The fixed estimate of Σy was computed
    using the expectation-maximization algorithm (S1 Appendix), which reflects the
    covariance in model prediction error on the training data. In this sense, Σy is
    the best guess of the variance that can be attributed to measurement noise. Uncertainty
    due to measurement noise cannot be reduced by collecting more data and is referred
    to as aleatory uncertainty, while uncertainty that could be minimized by collecting
    more data is referred to as epistemic uncertainty [44], both of which are captured
    by the model predicted uncertainty. The predicted uncertainty therefore reflects
    the degree of uncertainty associated with each experimental condition (e.g. the
    model could have varying levels of certainty about metabolite concentrations based
    on information from different consortia of microbial species). For the 10 randomized
    k-fold trials, the log-likelihood of held-out data using predicted variance was,
    on average, greater than the log-likelihood using the fixed variance (S5 Fig).
    The increase in the log-likelihood using model predicted uncertainty suggests
    that accounting for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty improved estimates
    of the distribution of model predictions compared to a model that only accounted
    for aleatory uncertainty. The ability to assign greater uncertainty to less understood
    experimental conditions is a key attribute that enables efficient exploration
    of a high-dimensional experimental design space. 2.3 Optimization of the production
    of a key metabolite by a microbial community in a bioreactor Mixed microbial communities
    cultured in bioreactors have many bioprocessing applications, including valorization
    of agricultural waste [45], production of medium chain fatty acids from carbon
    rich waste streams [1], and production of bioplastics as an alternative to petroleum-based
    plastics [46, 47]. Optimizing these functions requires manipulation of process
    control variables such as substrate feed rates, feed composition, pH, and gas
    exchange [48]. Although most bioprocessing applications have involved single organisms,
    microbial consortia have several advantages. These advantages include the ability
    to transform a wide range of available nutrients into valuable compounds by exploiting
    different metabolic niches and division of labor [49, 50] and robustness of target
    functions to environmental perturbations such as invasion [51–53]. Resources (i.e.
    nutrients) are key control knobs for manipulating microbial community metabolism.
    Therefore, we consider selection of different combinations of resources and the
    rate at which the feed containing these resources is added to a fed-batch bioreactor
    containing a 5-member microbial community to maximize the production of a valuable
    metabolite (e.g. medium or long chain fatty acid [1]). Although our modeling framework
    is generally applicable to other reactor operation modes, such as continuous culture,
    we chose to study fed-batch operation to highlight the model’s ability to capture
    strong time-dependent changes in resources and biomass. Fed-batch operation involves
    a feed of substrates to the reactor without any discharge from the reactor. This
    in turn yields time-dependent variation in reactor volume, cell density, and product
    concentrations. This example demonstrates the ability of the MiRNN to optimize
    a multidimensional system with respect to control inputs that are both static
    (selection of resources) and dynamic (selection of the feed rate). As the ground
    truth system, we simulate a modified consumer-resource model [54] embedded in
    a fed-batch bioreactor model that assumes growth-associated kinetics for metabolite
    production (i.e. the rate of metabolite production is proportional to species
    growth rate) [55]. Species interactions are governed by competition for a limited
    set of resources. The governing equations of the ground-truth model are where
    r is a vector of resource concentrations in the reactor, rf is a vector of resource
    concentrations in the feed, s is a vector of species that utilize a subset of
    the resources, d is a vector of resource degradation rates, g is a vector of minimum
    growth rates needed for each species to survive, m is the metabolite concentration,
    ym/s is a vector of yield coefficients, kd is the metabolite degradation rate,
    [C]ij is the rate species i consumes resource j, and u(t) represents the rate
    at which the feed is added to the bioreactor. Details on the specification of
    ground truth model parameters and the generation of simulated data are provided
    in the methods. Due to competition for limiting resources, introducing different
    combinations of resources will determine the temporal changes in species abundance.
    The objective for the MiRNN was to model species growth, s(t), and metabolite
    concentration, m(t), and identify the optimal combination of 7 resources, , and
    the rate that the feed should be added over time, u*(t), in order to maximize
    the total amount of target metabolite, evaluated as the metabolite concentration
    multiplied by the reactor volume at the end of a 130 hour batch operation (Fig
    4A and 4B). Simulated measurements were taken at 26 hour intervals, resulting
    in 5 measurements over the 130 hour simulation of the batch operation for each
    choice of resources. We considered 20 possible feed profiles for each possible
    combination of resources, which resulted in 20 × (27 − 1) = 2, 540 possible resource
    and feed rate configurations and 5 × 2, 540 = 12, 700 experimental conditions
    including the 5 measurement times (S1 Appendix). This number of possible experimental
    conditions would not be feasible to exhaustively explore using generally low-throughput
    bioreactor systems. As such, it is necessary to develop methods to strategically
    navigate the experimental design space. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger

    We compared the effectiveness of four different experimental design strategies
    (random sampling, pure exploration to maximize information content, pure exploitation
    to maximize profit, and exploration + exploitation to balance maximization of
    information content and profit) to find the bioreactor operating condition that
    maximized metabolite production. A pure exploration strategy seeks a set of experimental
    conditions that maximize the EIG, while the exploration + exploitation strategy
    evaluates experimental designs based on both the EIG and predicted outcomes. The
    variables subject to optimization included the resources in a feed stream and
    the rate at which the feed is added to a bioreactor over time (Fig 4A and 4B).
    Starting with a MiRNN trained on five randomly selected resource and feed rate
    configurations (25 experimental conditions, DTL 0), each experimental design method
    was used to select the next set of five resource and feed rate configurations
    that would compose the next experimental design (DTL 1). We emphasize that, in
    contrast to conventional Bayesian optimization approaches that select a single
    experimental condition in each cycle, the presented algorithm selects a batch
    of collectively informative experimental conditions in each experimental cycle.
    Data collected from each DTL cycle was used to update the model (Algorithm 1),
    which was then used to design the next DTL cycle, until five DTL cycles were completed
    resulting in a total of 30 resource and feed rate profiles tested (150 experimental
    conditions). This process was repeated 30 times each with a different randomly
    selected set of five resource and feed rate profiles in DTL 0. After each round
    of training, model predictions of end-point metabolite concentrations were compared
    to ground truth values for all 2, 540 possible resource and feed rate profiles
    to gauge how well the model learns system behavior (Fig 4C and S6 Fig). A pure
    exploration strategy results in the most accurate model performance after training
    on data from the first experimental design, while a pure exploitation strategy
    results in a decrease in model prediction performance due to sampling of redundant
    experimental conditions in a narrow region of the design space. The production
    levels from each experimental design strategy shows that all model guided approaches
    (exploitation+exploration, exploitation, and exploration) navigate to higher metabolite
    producing operating conditions than a random sampling strategy. The model guided
    experimental design strategy that combines exploitation and exploration outperforms
    pure exploitation (Fig 4D), with significantly higher metabolite production in
    design cycles 1 (p = .0017), 2 (p = .0128), 3 (p = .0024), 4 (p = .0031), and
    5 (p = .0203) according to a two-tailed paired t-test (n = 30). The median prediction
    performance of end-point metabolite concentration of the exploitation+exploration
    strategy after training on all data collected up to DTL 2 was not the highest
    across different strategies (R = 0.735). Nevertheless, the median identified metabolite
    production in the next design cycle (DTL 3) was nearly optimal (0.227 g). This
    implies that the model does not have to be highly accurate over the entire design
    space in order to be useful for seeking optimal operating conditions. The ability
    of the MiRNN to predict both metabolite concentrations and species abundance over
    time can provide useful insight into the relationship between species abundances
    and system functions. This is in contrast to conventional Bayesian optimization
    approaches where a model (e.g. a Gaussian process) would be used to predict only
    metabolite production directly from the selection of resources and feed profile.
    To illustrate how predictions of species abundance can provide insights, we can
    analyze MiRNN predictions of species abundances and metabolite production for
    the condition that was predicted to maximize metabolite production. The MiRNN
    predicted both high metabolite production and relatively high growth of species
    s2 (S7 Fig), suggesting that species s2 produces the metabolite. This matches
    the ground truth model where the only species that produces the target metabolite
    is s2, (). This agreement between model predictions and the ground truth system
    suggests that, when ground truth is not known, analyzing MiRNN predictions of
    system behavior under different experimental conditions can provide meaningful
    insights. 3 Discussion Despite their potential, the bottom-up design of microbiomes
    remains a challenge due to the massive design space of possible microbial consortia
    and environmental inputs (e.g. resources). Further, mechanisms driving community
    behaviors are typically not known precluding the development of predictive computational
    models based on first principles. In this work, we present the Microbiome Recurrent
    Neural Network (MiRNN); a physically constrained RNN model tailored to predict
    the dynamics of species interactions from data and predict target community functions.
    We use an approximate Bayesian inference strategy to compute a posterior parameter
    distribution, which enables the quantification of model prediction uncertainty
    and the evaluation of the information content of potential experimental designs.
    The ability of the MiRNN to learn microbial community dynamics from previously
    acquired data and evaluate the information content of experimental designs enables
    a sequential design-test-learn strategy to efficiently seek experimental conditions
    that optimize community functions (Fig 1). Recent studies have underscored the
    need for an iterative (closed-loop) design-test-learn strategy to build computational
    models that enable efficient exploration and exploitation of biological systems
    [56, 57], and in particular, microbial communities [58, 59]. Toward this end,
    we introduce the first physically constrained machine learning model to predict
    the dynamics of microbial communities and show that incorporating a physical constraint
    significantly improved the model’s ability to predict species abundances and metabolite
    concentrations using experimental data. Further, the model yielded comparable
    prediction performance to a previously developed LSTM model [14] despite more
    than a 50,000 fold reduction in the number of model parameters (S3 Fig). When
    we analyzed the sensitivity of the LSTM and the MiRNN to the size of the training
    data, we found that prediction performance of species abundances continued to
    improve given more experimental data (S4 Fig), exemplifying the need for experimental
    design strategies to select the most informative data needed to train machine
    learning models. Toward this end, the reduction in model parameters of the MiRNN
    compared to the LSTM makes the use of Bayesian inference techniques more tractable
    for the purpose of quantifying model prediction uncertainty and evaluating the
    information content of experimental designs. Model prediction uncertainty is used
    in active learning [60, 61], Bayesian optimization [31], and reinforcement learning
    [48]. The framework differs from most previous work on optimal experimental design
    of biological systems [21, 22, 24] since it leverages model uncertainty to select
    a set of experimental conditions for the purpose of optimizing a function of interest
    (exploitation and exploration), as opposed to designing experiments for the sole
    purpose of refining a model (exploration). Our results demonstrate that while
    a pure exploration strategy is the best approach for improving model predictions,
    it does not efficiently seek conditions that optimize a system objective. However,
    the proposed experimental design strategy that combines exploration with exploitation
    reduces the number of experiments needed to find optimal conditions compared to
    exploitation alone (Fig 4C and 4D). A limitation of the proposed methodology is
    that it relies on several approximations to enable fast selection of an experimental
    design, such as the assumption of Gaussian posterior parameter and predictive
    distributions. However, our model is an approximation of the ground truth system
    and despite imperfect predictions of system outcomes, the model is still able
    identify optimal experimental conditions (Fig 4). We therefore expect an approximate
    estimate of the information content of experimental designs to be sufficient in
    most applications. However, determining the effectiveness of our proposed experimental
    design framework to optimize systems where conditional distributions are known
    to be non-Gaussian [62] could be an area of future work. A limitation of the MiRNN,
    and any neural network based model, is that it offers limited interpretability
    for extracting new knowledge about the system. To tackle this problem, methods
    to extract meaning from a trained model such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
    Explanations (LIME) [63] have been used to derive relationships between variables
    in a similar modeling framework applied to microbial communities [14]. Alternatively,
    model predictions under different experimental conditions can be useful for gleaning
    mechanistic insights. For example, analyzing model predictions under the experimental
    condition that resulted in optimized metabolite production in our bioreactor case
    study correctly suggested that species s2 was responsible for producing the target
    metabolite (S7 Fig). Additionally, a limitation of discrete time models such as
    RNNs is the requirement for time series data to be sampled at consistent time
    intervals, which is often not the case in biological data sets where time series
    measurements are taken at different time resolutions. To overcome this limitation,
    the time interval can be included as an additional feature to the model or continuous
    time models such as neural ordinary differential equations [64] could be explored
    in future work. Our framework enables the optimization of microbial community
    functions using a closed-loop Bayesian experimental design strategy. Our approach
    is capable of incorporating time dependent inputs (e.g. feed rate of a bioreactor)
    as potential controls to modulate system behavior. We note that although the constraint
    was incorporated for the purpose of modeling physically consistent bacterial growth,
    the same model could be applied to other chemical reaction networks that exhibit
    autocatalytic behaviors. For optimization of synthetic microbial communities,
    we envision future applications of this framework to include the selection of
    microbial species and resources (e.g. fibers) to accelerate the discovery of bacterial
    therapeutics that produce beneficial metabolites and display robustness to environmental
    perturbations. In addition, we could apply this framework to the design of microbial
    species and environmental conditions to increase biological nitrogen fixation
    for enhancing plant growth [65], and the design of microbial consortia with improved
    production of valuable chemicals such as medium-chain fatty acids and bioplastics
    from agricultural waste streams. 4 Methods 4.1 Microbiome Recurrent Neural Network
    (MiRNN) model RNNs are flexible machine learning models that can be applied to
    learn complex dynamical models directly from multivariate time series data. In
    this work, we present the Microbiome Recurrent Neural Network (MiRNN), illustrated
    in Fig 5, which is a modified RNN that aims to learn and predict the dynamic behavior
    of microbial communities. A more detailed description of the model architecture
    that shows activation functions and the architecture of the feed-forward neural
    network is shown in S1 Fig. Specifically, the MiRNN architecture aims to learn
    dynamic trajectories for species abundances and metabolites given a set of potentially
    time dependent inputs and encodes constraints that prevent prediction of negative
    species abundance or metabolite concentration and prevents the spontaneous emergence
    of a species. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image
    Fig 5. Microbiome Recurrent Neural Network architecture. Inputs to the RNN at
    time step t − 1 include the state of species abundances, metabolite concentrations,
    control inputs, and a latent vector that stores information from previous steps
    and whose dimension determines the flexibility of the model. The output from each
    MiRNN block is the predicted system state and the latent vector at the next time
    step, t. To avoid the physically unrealistic emergence of previously absent species,
    a constrained feed-forward neural network (FFNN) outputs zero valued species abundances
    if species abundances at the previous time step were zero. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011436.g005
    We define a time horizon given by the index t = 0, …, nτ. The concentration of
    species at time t is denoted as . The concentration of metabolites at time t is
    denoted by . The value of the controls (inputs) at t is given by . The dynamic
    evolution of the MiRNN model is given by a mapping of the form: (1) Here, is a
    vector of latent variables at time t and is a vector of model parameters. The
    latent variables propagate information from previous states in time. Increasing
    the dimension of the latent variable vector increases model complexity and flexibility,
    and can be selected using training data by maximizing the model evidence. For
    all analyses in this study, we set nh = 16. We note that the controls at step
    t − 1 and t are both fed into the model evolution to account for the possibility
    of encountering strong time dependent variations in the control. The outputs of
    the RNN are the predicted system state and the latent vector at step t. The set
    of model parameters of the architecture is composed of the weights and biases
    θ = {Whh, bhh, Wih, Who, bho, h0}, which are learned from data. The MiRNN architecture
    is designed to prevent the physically unrealistic emergence of previously absent
    microbial species; this is done by introducing a logic block that sets the species
    abundances to zero if the abundances at the previous time step were zero. Once
    the model is trained, a rectified linear unit activation function is applied to
    model outputs so that the state vector is strictly non-negative. Importantly,
    the data must be scaled to values between zero and one based on the maximum values
    in the training data so that zero abundance species remain zero. This is in contrast
    to standardizing features, which preprocesses input data by subtracting the mean
    and dividing by the standard deviation of each input [12], since this approach
    does not preserve zero-valued features. Preprocessing the data by dividing by
    the maximum value of each input enables the use of the constraint and allows the
    ReLU activation to eliminate the possibility of negative valued model outputs
    after applying the inverse scaling transformation. In the context of experimental
    design, the control trajectories ut, t = 0, …, nτ and the initial states s0 and
    m0 are variables that we can manipulate to influence the evolution of the state
    trajectories, st (species) and mt (metabolites) for t = 1, …, nτ. Observed (measured)
    variables are referred to as outputs or observables; here, we assume that species
    abundances and metabolite concentrations can be measured and we encapsulate the
    entire set of output variables in the vector . The manipulated variables are called
    design variables in an experimental design context. We refer to a particular choice
    of design variables as an experimental condition, which is denoted by the variable
    qi. We define an experimental design as a set of n experimental conditions, q
    = {q1, …, qn}. We denote the entire set of m ≥ n possible experimental conditions
    as . 4.2 Bayesian estimation and uncertainty quantification We use a Bayesian
    framework to estimate the parameters of the model from designed experiments and
    to quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions given such experiments. We
    assume that we have an initial experimental design q with associated experimental
    conditions qi indexed by i = 1, …, n each with corresponding observed outputs
    y(qi). The entire set of available data from an experimental design, q, is defined
    as the set . We assume that the output observations are contaminated by random
    noise as: (2) where is the MiRNN output prediction at experimental condition qi,
    are the MiRNN parameters, and ε is a noise random variable with probability density
    . The matrix Σy describes the variance of the noise (this is a hyper-parameter
    that can be defined manually or can be inferred from data (S1 Appendix)). We assume
    that the random noise over the multiple experiments is independent and identically
    distributed (i.i.d) and thus the model likelihood is given by: (3) The prior over
    parameters is given by , where is the prior covariance (a diagonal matrix) and
    is a tunable hyper-parameter vector that inflates/deflates this covariance (S1
    Appendix). From Bayes’ theorem, the posterior parameter distribution is proportional
    to the product of the likelihood and the prior. The mode of the posterior density
    provides the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of model parameters and is obtained
    by minimizing the negative log of the posterior density with respect to θ, (4)
    which we solve numerically using Newton’s method. The addition of the prior in
    the likelihood function encourages sparsity of the parameter estimates if α is
    made sufficiently large [12, 66]. In order to quantify the uncertainty of the
    parameter estimates, it is necessary to obtain their posterior density. Here,
    we use the so-called Laplace approximation; this assumes the posterior density
    is a Gaussian centered at θMAP(q) and with covariance given by the inverse of
    the Hessian matrix of the negative log posterior, which is approximated as: (5)
    where is a matrix of derivatives of the model with respect to its parameters (referred
    to as the sensitivity matrix) and given by: (6) Computation of gradients is performed
    using automatic differentiation with JAX [67] using Python 3. We note here that
    the Hessian matrix given by Eq 5 is full rank due to the inclusion of the diagonal
    prior precision matrix. The posterior predictive distribution of the outputs for
    any experimental condition is found by marginalization over the posterior parameter
    distribution as: (7) Obtaining an analytical expression for (7) requires linearization
    of the model prediction with respect to the parameters around θMAP(q) to obtain
    a linear-Gaussian model [12], (8) with (9) These expressions highlight how the
    design variables q propagate through the data , the calculation of the estimate
    θMAP(q), and ultimately influence the uncertainty of the model predictions. As
    such, it is important to derive systematic procedures to determine such experiments.
    4.3 Fast Bayesian experimental design to optimize information content and system
    outcomes Bayesian experimental design methods use information from a previous
    experimental design, q(l), to inform the selection of the next experimental design,
    q(l+1). One commonly used strategy is to find q(l+1) that maximizes the expected
    information gain (EIG), which is quantified by the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence
    between the parameter posterior and the current parameter distribution [25, 61],
    (10) Using the model predictive distribution given by Eq 8 and assuming that the
    posterior distribution is Gaussian, the EIG can be approximated as (see S1 Appendix)
    (11) For linear-Gaussian models, experimental designs that maximize equation Eq
    11 are referred to as Bayesian D-optimal [25], because they maximize the determinant
    of the expected posterior precision matrix. Similarly, D-optimal experimental
    designs are often selected based on the determinant of the Fisher information
    matrix (FIM) [68], given by (12) Although widely used in practice [23, 69–71],
    methods for experimental design based on maximizing either Eqs 11 or 12 can be
    computationally expensive since they require evaluating the determinant of a matrix
    with dimensions nθ × nθ. If the experimental design is composed of a single experimental
    condition, q(l+1), it has been shown [25, 61] for linear-Gaussian models that
    the condition that maximizes the EIG is equivalent to the condition that maximizes
    the determinant of the prediction covariance due to the following identity (S1
    Appendix), (13) Since typically ny << nθ, finding the experimental condition that
    maximizes prediction variance is a computationally efficient means of finding
    a Bayesian D-optimal condition; however, it is often desirable in experimental
    design applications to evaluate the information content of a set of n > 1 experimental
    conditions. We therefore present an expression that we show to be equivalent to
    Eq 11 (S1 Appendix) and which generalizes Eq 13 to compute the information content
    of n conditions, (14) where The matrix inverse in Eq 14 can be efficiently computed
    using the Woodbury matrix identity, (15) Using Eqs 14 and 15, we can efficiently
    approximate the EIG of an experimental design with n experimental conditions by
    avoiding computing the determinant of a matrix whose dimension is nθ × nθ in favor
    of evaluating the determinant and inverse of n matrices each with dimension ny
    × ny (S8 Fig). In this work, we aim to find experiments that maximize information
    content and optimize a profit function of interest. As such, we define an acquisition
    function that accounts for the predicted profit of experimental outcomes [25]
    as well as the EIG, (16) where fP(q(l), q(l+1)) quantifies the predicted profit
    of the next design (e.g., total amount of product produced in each experiment).
    The profit function is an implicit function of the MiRNN model (i.e., the profit
    is predicted using the MiRNN model). The function EIG(q(l), q(l+1)) quantifies
    the information content of the design q(l+1)) and is approximated using Eqs 14
    and 15. The parameter modifies the emphasis given to either profit or information
    content, and can be automatically adjusted to select for new experimental conditions
    as described in section 4.4. Given previously observed experimental designs q(l)
    and a set of all possible experimental conditions that could be tested, our goal
    is to select the next design such that we maximize the acquisition function: (17)
    We note that the optimal experiments q*(l+1) are obtained based on best predicted
    performance (as predicted by the model); as such, these need to be tested in the
    real experimental system to obtain new outputs. This allows us to obtain a sequential
    experimental design framework in which we aim to progressively refine the model
    to maximize the profit function of interest. Algorithm 1: Sequential Bayesian
    experimental design Require: , fP, lmax l ← 0 while l < lmax do {Estimate model
    parameter mean and covariance} {Design next experiment} {Collect new data, append
    to existing data} q(l) ← {q(l), q(l+1)} l ← l + 1 end while 4.4 Greedy algorithm
    to search for optimal experimental designs Finding the optimal next design q*(l+1)
    requires an exhaustive search over the set (particularly when the design variables
    are categorical). As expected, however, exhaustive enumeration would require evaluating
    f(q(l), q(l+1)) for all (which can be computationally prohibitive). As such, we
    implement a greedy search algorithm that works satisfactorily well in practice.
    It is important to emphasize that the experimental design framework has the final
    goal of maximizing the profit function (as opposed to just refine the model);
    as such, it searches for experiments in a more targeted manner and can improve
    profit without having a perfect prediction model. Greedy algorithms are often
    used as an approximate approach to optimize experimental designs [22]. Given a
    total number of conditions to include in the next design, nq(l+1), the search
    starts by finding an experimental condition that maximizes the profit function,
    . With q(l+1) initialized as , the i > 1 experimental condition is selected by
    determining (18) where wI is set to a small initial value (e.g. .0001) and gradually
    increased until . The process continues until a desired number of conditions are
    selected. 4.5 Specification of ground truth bioreactor model parameters The governing
    equations of the model are given by where r is a vector of resource concentrations
    in the reactor, rf is a vector of resource concentrations in the feed, s is a
    vector of consumer species, d is a vector of resource degradation rates, g is
    a vector of minimum growth rates needed for each species to survive, m is the
    metabolite concentration, ym/s is a vector of yield coefficients, kd is the product
    degradation rate, [C]ij is the rate species i consumes resource j, and u(t) represents
    the rate at which the feed is added to the reactor. The parameters of the model
    that need to be specified include C, d, g, ym/s, and kd. The specification of
    the consumer resource component of the model and its parameters is a modified
    version of the model presented in [54]. The matrix of species-resource interaction
    coefficients was determined by first specifying the probability that a species
    depends on a resource, ps/r, which was set to .6 for the simulation. A matrix
    of concentration parameters, denoted as Θ determines the degree that a species
    depends on the concentration of a resource, where where [Θ′]i,j ∼ Uniform(0, 1)
    with probability ps/r and is zero otherwise. The matrix of interaction coefficients
    are sampled from a Normal distribution with parameters given by All elements of
    the degradation rate of metabolites, d, and the minimum amount of resources necessary,
    g, were set to .01. The degradation rate of the product, kd, was set to .005.
    The metabolite yield coefficients were specified to be ym/s = [0, .5, 0, 0, 0],
    since species two depended on the fewest number of resources. This specification
    is important so that the optimal set of resources in the feed is not simply the
    inclusion of all resources. Each output in each simulated condition was corrupted
    with 5% Gaussian noise to mimic variation in experimental measurements. Supporting

    function to determine whether the incoming species abundance vector, st−1, is
    greater than zero. The effect of the constraint is to ensure that if a particular
    species is zero at time t − 1, the model prediction of that species at time t
    will also be zero. A LeakyReLU function is used to activate the hidden layer,

  description: To realize site-specific and variable-rate application of agricultural
    pesticides, accurately metering and controlling the chemical injection rate is
    necessary. This study presents a prototype of a direct nozzle injection system
    (DNIS) by which chemical concentration transport lag was greatly reduced. In this
    system, a rapid-reacting solenoid valve (RRV) was utilized for injecting chemicals,
    driven by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal at 100 Hz, so with varying pulse
    width the chemical injection rate could be adjusted. Meanwhile, a closed-loop
    control strategy, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method, was applied for
    metering and stabilizing the chemical injection rate. In order to measure chemical
    flow rates and input them into the controller as a feedback in real-time, a thermodynamic
    flowmeter that was independent of chemical viscosity was used. Laboratory tests
    were conducted to assess the performance of DNIS and PID control strategy. Due
    to the nonlinear input–output characteristics of the RRV, a two-phase PID control
    process obtained better effects as compared with single PID control strategy.
    Test results also indicated that the set-point chemical flow rate could be achieved
    within less than 4 s, and the output stability was improved compared to the case
    without control strategy.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract To realize site-specific and variable-rate application
    of agricultural pesticides, accurately metering and controlling the chemical injection
    rate is necessary. This study presents a prototype of a direct nozzle injection
    system (DNIS) by which chemical concentration transport lag was greatly reduced.
    In this system, a rapid-reacting solenoid valve (RRV) was utilized for injecting
    chemicals, driven by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal at 100 Hz, so with
    varying pulse width the chemical injection rate could be adjusted. Meanwhile,
    a closed-loop control strategy, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method,
    was applied for metering and stabilizing the chemical injection rate. In order
    to measure chemical flow rates and input them into the controller as a feedback
    in real-time, a thermodynamic flowmeter that was independent of chemical viscosity
    was used. Laboratory tests were conducted to assess the performance of DNIS and
    PID control strategy. Due to the nonlinear input–output characteristics of the
    RRV, a two-phase PID control process obtained better effects as compared with
    single PID control strategy. Test results also indicated that the set-point chemical
    flow rate could be achieved within less than 4 s, and the output stability was
    improved compared to the case without control strategy. Keywords: variable-rate
    application; closed-loop control; pulse width modulation; direct nozzle injection;
    thermodynamic flowmeter 1. Introduction Previous studies have pointed out that
    there are advantages to realizing site-specific and variable-rate application
    of pesticides [1,2,3]. Broadcast application of chemicals without concentration
    variance and spatial selection results in fields being sprayed without distinction.
    On the one hand, over-application of chemicals not only increases the cost of
    crop production, but also increases the risk of environmental contamination and
    the exposure hazards to operators. On the other hand, insufficient application
    of chemical may cause a decrease of crop yield, or make the weeds chemical-resistant.
    Conventional boom sprayers mix a measured quantity of pesticide with a defined
    amount of carrier in a tank. Chemical application rates can only be varied by
    changing the liquid delivery pressure, but the pressure changes also unexpectedly
    affect the droplet size spectra and spray distribution pattern of the nozzles
    [4]. However, by using a direct injection system, chemical and carrier are kept
    separately and mixed together when sprayed. The delivery pressure of carrier stream
    is maintained at the same level, as are the pressure at the nozzles, the droplet
    size spectrum and the spray distribution pattern [5]. Through changing the chemical
    injection volume, the chemical application rate can be changed. GopalaPillai et
    al. tested an electrical flow control system for site-specific herbicide applications
    and its steady state performance [6]. Solenoid valves were used and controlled
    by a PWM signal in the system. The chemical flow rate was varied by changing the
    duty cycle of the PWM signal from 10% to 100%. However, this was an open-loop
    system. The precision and stabilization of chemical flow rate were not discussed.
    Han et al. also tested a DIS with solenoids controlled by a PWM signal in an open-loop
    control system [7]. They found the flow rate control error ranged from −15% to
    +12%. Effective flow rate control requires fast and accurate metering of chemicals
    for the direct injection sprayer, which could be accomplished by using a positive
    driven pump or a closed–loop control system with the help of flowmeters [8]. Frost
    et al. developed a metering system in which a metered flow of water was used to
    control the flow rate of chemical [9]. That was a kind of central direct injection
    system (CDIS), where chemical was injected into the system downstream from the
    main carrier tank and prior to branching of the distribution hoses carrying the
    solution to different boom sections. The advantage of that system is that the
    chemical was metered by a closed-loop contoller so that it could provide a wide
    range of chemical dose rates precisely, while the disadvantage was the long lag
    time from a change in the chemical flow rate to the corresponding changes in its
    concentration at the spraying points [10]. To solve the long lag time problem,
    Vondricka and Schulze Lammers proposed a direct nozzle injection system (DNIS)
    concept, in which the point where the chemical was injected into the system was
    changed to be at the nozzles [11]. This improvement shortened the chemical flow
    path and hence reduced the lag time significantly. Subsequently, their team focused
    on many aspects of this DNIS. Vondricka addressed on the problem of mixture homogeneity
    and Doerpmund assessed the cleanability of this DNIS [12,13,14]. However, there
    is still a need to investigate the performance for DNIS metering and chemical
    flow rate control, which is the premise for realizing site-specific and variable-rate
    application of chemicals. The objective of this article was to test the injection
    uniformity of RRVs within a boom section of the DNIS, to present a closed-loop
    control method to meter and stabilize the chemical application rate with the help
    of a thermodynamic flowmeter, and to evaluate the performance of the control system
    and the DNIS by an EC sensor. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Description of RRV
    A new rapid reacting magnetic valve design was developed to inject pesticides.
    A schematic of its structure is shown in Figure 1. It mainly consists of a cylindrical
    metal cavity, an induction copper coil (resistance: ca. 3~5 Ω), metal ball, valve
    seat and rubber washers. Figure 1. Structure of the RRV. When electric current
    flows through the copper coil, a strong magnetic field is generated inside the
    metal cavity based on the electromagnetic induction principle, then the metal
    ball is pushed aside by the magnetic field. Thus an access for the chemical from
    the inlet to the orifice of the valve seat is formed, through which pressurized
    chemical can be injected. If there is no electric current in the coil, the pressurized
    chemical pushes the metal ball onto the valve seat causing a tight contact between
    the ball and the rubber washer, which finally shut down the flux of chemical.
    In this case, RRV is switched off. The RRV is powered by a PWM signal at a frequency
    of 100 HZ generated by a FPGA controller. The pulse width during which the RRV
    remains open in one PWM period determines the injection time and hence the injection
    volume of chemical. Thus, by adjusting the length of the pulse width, the chemical
    injection rate could be varied. 2.2. Experiment Setup The proposed DNIS was 21
    m of length, and was equipped with 42 direct injection units which were divided
    into seven boom sections. Within one section, six direct injection units were
    controlled by a same PWM signal as shown in Figure 2a. Figure 2b shows the structure
    of one direct injection unit, which includes a carrier valve, a RRV, a mixing
    chamber, an EC sensor, and a spray nozzle. Figure 2. (a) Schematic structure of
    the experimental setup with a boom section; (b) one of the injection units. Figure
    3 shows test bench to implement our closed-loop control strategy for metering
    the chemical injection rate of the RRV. It is composed of a direct injection unit,
    flowmeter, two pressure regulators, and a controller. The EC sensor mounted between
    mixing chamber and nozzle in injection unit was used to indicate the concentration
    of the spraying solution, it could also be used to verify the control effect.
    The flowmeter is based on the thermodynamic principle. When a liquid medium flows
    through, the sensor generates a heat pulse internally. The heat is then conducted
    away by the medium flux resulting in a cooling down of the sensor. The temperature
    within the sensor is measured and compared with the temperature of the medium,
    and the flow rate can be derived from the temperature difference. Theoretically,
    the flowmeter is independent of the viscosity of the agricultural chemicals. The
    chemical applied in the experiments was not real, and it was simulated by a solution
    consisting of (in proportion by weight) 10% LUVITEC® powder, 3% salt and 87% water.
    The LUVITEC® powder was used as additive to adjust the solution viscosity in the
    range of 230–240 mPa·s. Salt made the solution electrical conductive, so the EC
    sensor could detect the concentration of the solution. The more electroconductive
    the solution at the nozzle was, the more chemical the RRV injected. Moreover,
    the stability of EC values indicated the stability of the chemical flow rate.
    Figure 3. Setup for controlling pesticide injection rate by closed-loop method.
    2.3. Uniformity Test of 6 RRVs in One Boom Section Within a boom section, six
    injection units are controlled by one PWM signal (see Figure 2a), so they are
    expected to inject chemical in a same rate, but because the chemical loses pressure
    along the flux direction in the boom, this results in the pressures at injection
    units being different, and there exist individual differences among these RRVs,
    so the chemical injection rates are not consistent in practice. Therefore experiments
    to assess the uniformity of six RRVs in one boom section when they work in an
    open control loop were conducted. In this experiment, water and chemical pressure
    were adjusted at 3 bar and 7 bar, respectively, and the pulse width of the PWM
    signal was set at 1000 μs. The volumes of chemical injected by the six injection
    units in 3 min were sampled three times repeatedly, and the the average injected
    volume per minute and the standard deviation were calculated as the injection
    rate and error bar, respectively. 2.4. Calculating the Range of Chemical Injection
    Rate Assume that the DNIS (with a boom of 21 m in length and with 42 injection
    units) was used for spraying in a field, and each injection unit was supposed
    to inject chemical in a same rate of r mL/min. If the tractor drove with speed
    of v m/h, after t hours, the sprayed area would be S ha and the total volume of
    chemical sprayed would be W mL. The the following equations could be derived:
    42 × rt × 60 = W (1) 21 × vt = 10000 × S (2) Equation (1) divided by Equation
    (2) gives the chemical injection rate r: 𝑟= 𝑣𝑊 1200000𝑆 (3) Empirically, the tractor
    speed v ranged from 6 km/h to 10 km/h, chemical per hectare needed in the field
    (W/S) was assumed from 20 mL/ha to 4000 mL/ha. Accoording to Equation (3), the
    injection rate of each RRV should range from 0.1 to 33.3 mL/min, which could cover
    most spraying applications. 2.5. Closed-Loop Control The chemical injection rate
    from the RRV is susceptible to factors such as the delivery pressure of both carrier
    and chemical, chemical viscosity, and any unexpected external disturbances, so
    the actual flow rate injected by the RRV deviates from the desired value while
    spraying because it is not possible to keep the operation conditions constant.
    The deviation would not be corrected automatically in a system with an open-loop
    control strategy, but a closed-loop controller could compensate for the deviation
    and keep the flow rate stable, thus realizing a more precise application of chemical.
    Figure 4 shows the block diagram of a closed-loop control system for the chemical
    injection rate, based on the PID method. Symbol E represents the deviation between
    the set-point flow rate Qt and the actual flow rate Q measured by a flowmeter.
    The controller adjusts the pulse width P of the PWM signal to minimize E. Figure
    4. Block diagram of the closed-loop control. 2.6. Experimental Procedures The
    following experiments were performed: The RRV was tested, and the relationship
    between the input pulse width P and the output chemical injection rate was investigated;
    in this experiment, the water pressure was set at 3 bar, and the air pressure
    for pushing the chemical was adjusted to 6, 7 and 8 bar to obtain the input-output
    characteristics of the RRV under three pressure differences and hence to compare
    the optimal operating conditions for the RRV. The uniformity of six RRVs controlled
    by the same PWM signal (pulse width was 1000 μs) within one boom section was tested.
    The flowmeter was calibrated. The amount of injected chemical in 3 min was weighed
    three times, an the average value per minute was calculated as the injection rate.
    A single PID module was applied in the control system at first. Subsequently a
    two-phase PID control strategy was used that managed to improve the control effect
    in accordance with the input-output characteristic of the RRV. 3. Results and
    Discussion 3.1. Tests of the RRV Figure 5 shows the injection rate of the RRV
    as a function of the pulse width under three pressure differences. Through experimental
    tests, it was determined that an air pressure of 7 bar for pushing the chemical
    and a water pressure of 3 bar were the optimal choice for the best performance
    of the RRV and nozzle. The curves demonstrate that RRV has a large injection rate
    range from less than 0.1 mL/min to more than 30 mL/min, that meets the requirements
    as calculated previously. The curve under a pressure difference of 4 bar is smoother
    than those of 3 bar and 5 bar, which means the input-output characteristics of
    the RRV in this case is more linear than the other cases, and the normally linear
    system is easier to control. Figure 5. Injection rate of RRV under three air pressures,
    calibrated by using 10% LUVITEC® solution. 3.2. Uniformity Test of Six RRVs within
    One Boom Section Figure 6 shows that, under the given experimental conditions:
    (1) the injection rates of six RRVs within one boom section are roughly equal,
    and around 14 mL/min; (2) however, along the direction of chemical flow in the
    boom the injection rate of each RRV has a trend to slightly decrease, which is
    probably due to the loss of chemical pressure at the inlet of the RRVs, which
    leads to the RRVs not being operated at the recommended pressure; (3) the error
    bars representing the standard deviations, (which range from 0.2 to 0.77 mL/min),
    emphasise the unstable flows injected by the RRVs. Figure 6. Injection rates of
    6 RRVs within one boom section, when PWM signal was with pulse width 1000 μs.
    The error bars increase from injection unit 1 to 6 illustrates that the further
    away the injection unit is from the chemical inlet of the boom, the more unstable
    the flow rate is. Based on this, it could be concluded that, with an open control
    strategy, it is hard for the DNIS to meter and inject chemical precisely, even
    under stable conditions, but metering and injecting the chemical precisely is
    the premise for site-specific and variable-rate application of chemicals, so closed-loop
    control is necessary for this DNIS. 3.3. Calibration of the Thermodynamic Flowmeter
    The thermodynamic flowmeter has a wide measurement range, which is determined
    by adjusting the coefficient of amplification manually. In accordance with range
    of RRV injection rates, the measurement scale was specified and the calibration
    curve was obtained as shown in Figure 7. Although this thermodynamic flowmeter
    was independent of chemical viscosity, it was affected by the thermal conductivity
    of the liquid medium. Thus, before a different type of chemical can be applied,
    a specific calibration is required in advance. Figure 7. Calibration of the flowmeter.
    3.4. Tuning the PID Parameters According to the Ziegler-Nichols method introduced
    by Frost [9], the transfer function of RRV could be simplified as below: 𝑄(𝑠)
    𝑃(𝑠) = 𝑘𝑒 − 𝑠𝑇 1 1+ 𝑠𝑇 2 (4) The time constants T1, T2 and the gain k were obtained
    experimentally from an open loop response of the system to a typical step input
    (input pulse width is 1200 μs, magnitude of flow rate change step is 19.21 mL/s,)
    as shown in Figure 8. The values are as follows: T1 = 0.105 s, T2 = 0.28 s, k
    = 0.117 mL−1·s·V. The Ziegler Nichols method suggested the best average settings
    for a PID controller with transfer function: 𝐺(𝑠)= 𝐾 𝑐 (1+ 1 𝑇 𝑖 𝑠 + 𝑇 𝑑 𝑠) (5)
    where 𝐾 𝑐 = 1.2 𝑇 2 𝑘𝑇 1 , Ti = 2T1, Td = 0.5T1. The above values of T1, T2, k
    gave approximatively: Kc = 27, Ti = 0.21 s, Td = 0.057 s Figure 9 shows the performance
    of the closed-loop control to a step input for four different groups of PID parameters
    when the set-point output of the flowmeter was 8 V (equivalent to a set-point
    flow rate = 11.8 mL/min). The Ziegler Nichols controller design method gave a
    reasonable first estimate of controller coefficients, through slight adjustment,
    PID parameters (Kc = 25, Ti = 0.6, Td = 0) was verified as most suitable for the
    system, they caused a smallest overshoot as well as least oscilation of the flow
    rate (the solid line) than others whoses PID parameters were tuned randomly, although
    each group of PID parameters could ultimately stablize the flow rate. Comprehensively
    comparing the index of these four transient responses, PID parameters (Kc = 255,
    Ti = 0.3, Td = 0.075) caused the transient flow rate to exceed the measurement
    range of the flowmeter, so it can not be used in the controller. The parameters
    (Kc = 25, Ti = 0.6, Td = 0) were preferred, as it only took roughly 1.3 s for
    the system to achieve a target flow rate with a very small overshoot. Figure 8.
    Open loop response to a step input P = 1200 μs, to obtain the transfer function
    coefficients. Figure 9. Variation in output of flowmeter as a function of time
    as flow rate controlled with four groups of different PID parameters, the set-point
    flowmeter = 8 V (equivalent to chemical flow rate = 11.8 mL/min). 3.5. Two-Phase
    Control The PID controller worked well for linear systems, however, due to the
    fact the input-output characteristics of the RRV are not strictly linear as shown
    in Figure 10, only one PID control module is not enough for precisely metering
    chemical flow rates in the entire range. The system could be treated as a partial
    linear system with two sections, where each section has different input-output
    characteristics. Section 1 is the scale when the pulse width is below 850 μs,
    under which conditions the injection rate is lower than around 4.5 mL/min, and
    Section 2 is when the pulse width is above 850 and the corresponding injection
    rate is higher than around 4.5 mL/min. In each section, the relationship between
    input pulse width and output injection rate was simplified as linear. By this
    simplification, the efficient control performance in entire range could be maintained
    through adding another PID module to the controller for Section 1. The tuned PID
    module with parameters (Kc = 25, Ti = 0.6, Td = 0) was adequate for Section 2,
    and it worked well when the set-point output of the flowmeter was above 7 V (equivalent
    to a set-point chemical flow rate higher than 4.5 mL/min), but it was not suitable
    for Section 1. As the target output of the flowmeter was below 7 V, the time needed
    to achieve the target flow rate was much longer. An example for the set-point
    output of the flowmeter at 5 V (equivalent to a set-point chemical flow rate =
    0.17 mL/min) is shown in Figure 11 (dashed line), and the time delay is ca. 15
    s. Figure 10. Sectional linear input-output characteristic of RRV. Based on the
    analysis above, the control strategy was modified to a two-phase controllor with
    two different PID modules for the two sections, respectively. Section 2 continued
    to use the tuned PID module, and another PID module with parameters (Kc = 70,
    Ti = 0.2, Td = 0) tuned by the Ziegler Nichols method as well was used for Section
    1. As a result, the flow rate control in the range of less than 4.5 mL/min was
    significantly improved. Figure 11 also shows an example of the set-point flowmeter
    output at 5 V (equivalent to a chemical flow rate of 0.17 mL/min) metered by the
    two-phase controller (solid line). It took less than 4 s to achieve a steady state,
    which is a great improvement compared with the dashed line obtained from a single
    PID mode. Figure 11. Time domain responses of the system, when the set-point flowmeter
    output is 5 V (equivalent to a chemical flow rate of 0.17 mL/min). Table 1 shows
    indexes of transient responses regulated by the two-phase PID controller. Overall,
    the steady-state errors are less than 0.021 V, meaning that flow rates can be
    metered and stabilized at the targeted value precisely. The settling times are
    less than 3.17 s, indicating the controller could regulate the flow rate in a
    short time. Associating the response index with the two sections, it can be found
    that the settling times for Section 2 (0.98~1.31 s) are less than those for Section
    1 (2.58~3.32 s), and the maximum overshoot values (4.13%~6.48%) for Section 2
    are less than those for Section 1 (20.77%~36.88%) as well. This illustrates that
    the PID module for Section 2 meters the flow rate more efficiently than the module
    for Section 1. It does not mean the module parameters (Kc = 70, Ti = 0.2, Td =
    0) for Section 1 is not the best fitted, because many other PDI modules with various
    parameters had been tried, and the parameters (Kc = 70, Ti = 0.2, Td = 0) worked
    the best. Table 1. Indexes of the transient responses. 3.6. EC Measuring Method
    to Evaluate the Effect of the Closed-Loop Control The performance of the closed-loop
    controller also can be verified from the output of the EC sensor as shown in Figure
    12, in which the readings are from the same test displayed by a solid line in
    Figure 9. Comparing these two curves, the flowmeter output and EC sensor change
    simultaneously. Although they have opposite trends (the calibration of the EC
    sensor is negative correlative, the higher the flow rate and therefore the conductivity,
    the lower the output voltage), both could be used to indicate the flow rate. After
    the flow rate achieved a steady state, the EC values were analyzed. The consistency
    and stability of the EC values indicate the concentration of the salt solution
    was stable, hence the flow rate metered by the closed-loop controller was constant.
    Figure 12. Output of the EC sensor when the desired output of the flowmeter was
    set at 8 V (equivalent to a desired chemical flow rate set at 11.8 mL/min). 4.
    Conclusions An accurate control of chemical injection rates is the basis of the
    site-specific, variable-rate application of chemicals. This article tested a feasible
    method to control the flow rate for a direct nozzle injection system. From the
    results, the following conclusions can be drawn: The RRV used in the DNIS could
    inject chemical with flow rates ranging from 0.1 mL/min to more than 30 mL/min,
    which covers most spraying operations in the field. The thermodynamic flowmeter
    met the requirement of measuring wide range of flow rate, and it was independent
    of chemical viscosity. However, it was affected by the thermal conductivty of
    the liquid medium, so calibration for different chemicals was necessary before
    application. The closed-loop controller (PID) worked well for metering and controlling
    flow rates precisely, but the tuning of PID parameters should be carefully considered,
    as it was highly related to the input-output charicteristics of the RRV. If the
    input-output characteristics of the injection unit are non-linear, a two-phase
    controlling method was an optimal solution. Acknowledgments We wish to thank the

    The closed-loop control system improved the uniformity and stability of chemical
    injection rates compared to an open-loop control system.'
  limitations: The study does not provide a detailed case study of a fully implemented

  relevance_evaluation: This article is somewhat relevant to the point about case
    studies of successful implementations of closed-loop, autonomous irrigation systems
    in research and commercial settings, as it presents a prototype of a DNIS with
    a closed-loop PID control strategy. The article demonstrates the effectiveness
    of the proposed system in terms of metering and controlling chemical injection
    rates, which is a critical aspect of autonomous irrigation systems. However, the
    article primarily focuses on the design, testing, and evaluation of the DNIS and
    its control strategy, rather than providing a detailed case study of a fully implemented
    autonomous irrigation system in a research or commercial setting. Therefore, it
    does not fully address the specific point.

  description: Groundwater extraction from aquifers is the primary approach for supplying
    agricultural water demand due to the inadequate, unfair, and unreliable distribution
    of surface water (SW) systems. In this regard, the present study developed an
    automated operating system for conjunctive surface and groundwater (GW) resources.
    By centralized model predictive control (CMPC), an automated SW distribution system
    was developed in MATLAB and integrated with the groundwater modeling system (GMS)
    to provide an intelligent SW-GW conjunctive operating system in water scarcity
    scenarios. A controversial irrigation district in central Iran is selected as
    the test case in Iran. GW extraction from active tube-wells in the SW distribution
    system's territory includes 39%, 21%, 40% deep, semi-deep, and shallow. Besides,
    about 65% of energy consumption is related to over-exploitation in deep wells.
    The notable point of automating the SW system is the high capability of CMPC to
    control fluctuations in all canal reaches so that the dependability and adequacy
    of water distribution become reasonable even under severe scenarios. Intelligent
    SW-GW operating system led to an uprise of 0.1–2.2, 0.2–3.2, 0.4–3.9, 0.7–6.9,
    1.5–9.1, and 3.8–13.5 m in the aquifer water level, respectively, within 12, 2,
    36, 48, 60, and 120 months. Besides, Water extraction reduction from the aquifer
    after one year is about 16%, and the reduction of annual energy consumption is
    around 81%. The proposed method enables authorities to promote the SW distribution
    in practical, implementable, and step-by-step planning to reduce GW extraction
    from tube-wells based on actual water reduction potential.

  explanation: The study presents a new, systematic technique to increase resilience
    in important aquifers that are being rapidly depleted. The approach incorporates
    surface water and groundwater resources to replace overused groundwater extraction
    in irrigation systems, offering a practical and implementable long-term solution.
  extract_1: '"As a result, the allocated surface water to the irrigation districts
    kept constant within the three operational scenarios (i.e., normal, moderate and
    severe water shortages scenarios) and the water distribution operating system
    automation resulted in 16%, 12%, and 9% operational losses reduction. These conserved
    water volumes play as a new surface water source for the irrigation district."'
  extract_2: '"Accordingly, the surface water allocation process to the irrigation
    districts has not been changed. However, the annual groundwater resources portion
    decreased by 123,911,502 m3 and reached 701,503,610 m3 in the normal operational
    scenario, decreased by 94,062,775 and reached 731,825,823 m3 in the moderate water
    shortage scenario, decreased by 82,402,965 and reached 743,033,053 m3 in the severe
    water shortages operational scenarios."'

    DistrictConjunctive OperationSustainable Agriculture 1. Introduction In recent
    decades, continuous water shortage periods and the substantial decline of renewable
    water resources in arid regions have challenged the timely and appropriate distribution
    of water supplied from surface water resources in proportion to the entire agricultural
    demands (Ghazanfari et al., 2013). Groundwater (GW) extraction from aquifers in
    agricultural regions is the primary approach for supplying agricultural water
    demand by farmers due to the inadequate, unfair, and unreliable distribution of
    surface water (SW) systems (Rani and Singh, 2018). According to the literature,
    the agricultural water demand in most regions around the world is supplied from
    GW resources accounting for about 90, 89, 80, 72, 70, 68, 67, 58, and 54%, respectively
    in Iran, India, Spain, Japan, Argentina, US, Greece, Australia, and China (Hosseini
    Jolfan et al., 2019;). The volume of extracted GW and intensified pressure on
    aquifers are the primary challenge in countries on the arid belts due to the lack
    of replacement by rainfall or artificial recharge projects. Accordingly, different
    studies have been conducted on the optimal water consumption in on-farm scales
    - such as developing pressurized irrigation systems and precision agriculture
    techniques - and off-farm scales, included the integrated groundwater-surface
    water allocation (GW-SW) operation (Safavi and Enteshari, 2016) and automation
    of SW distribution systems using various centralized and decentralized techniques
    (Guan et al., 2011). Canal automation projects were initially employed in SW''s
    distribution systems to increase farmers'' flexibility in agricultural water delivery.
    Different ranges of the control algorithms, from classical-based to machine learning-oriented
    approaches and decentralized to centralized configurations, have been extensively
    employed to meet multiple operating SW distribution systems objectives (Yang et
    al., 2021, Zhong et al., 2020). Most studies in this field employ a hydraulic
    simulation model (based on field measurements in one or two intervals) to simulate
    water distribution by comparing variations of delivered water and agricultural
    water demand at each catchment and eventually evaluating the performance of SW
    distribution. In this regard, flow hydraulics simulation models such as SOBEK,
    EPA-SWMM, HEC-RAS, CANALMAN, and SIC or open-source academic models such as ICSS
    based on the numerical solution of Saint-Venant equations with different numerical
    schemes are used to achieve the desired objective (Liu et al., 2013, Zhonghao
    et al., 2019). The high accuracy and reliability of automatic control methods
    have caused extensive application of automatic control algorithms in SW distribution
    and replacement of controllers with an operator and numerical models with simplified
    analytical models. (Maestre et al., 2013, Shahverdi et al., 2016, Shahdany and
    Firoozfar, 2017, Omidzade et al., 2020, Rodriguez et al., 2020, Shahverdi et al.,
    2020). Following the innovations in employing different control algorithms with
    diverse configurations, the necessity of shifting the conventional single objective
    operation – focused on technical criteria- to a multi-objective one has been created
    to fulfill sustainable agricultural water management. Accordingly, social, economic,
    socio-economic, and environmental objectives have been included in modernization
    projects (Kamrani et al., 2020, Roozbahani et al., 2020). In this regard, the
    present study included two environmental objectives of i) groundwater conservation
    and ii) energy consumption reduction to the conventional technical objective in
    the modernization project. Therefore, a modified version of controllers and a
    new appraisal perspective are needed to simulate the multi-objective operation
    and investigate its performance to fulfill the objectives. So, the present study''s
    novelty is presenting a modified version of a centralized controller to shift
    the controller''s objective from the technical (i.e., minimizing the water level
    violations from the target boundaries) to a technical-environmental perspective
    (i.e., including minimization of the groundwater extraction within the district).
    For the first time, this study investigates i) the potential benefits of integrating
    automatic SW distribution systems and the groundwater modeling system (GMS) to
    enhance the over-exploitation resiliency of aquifers, and ii) short-term and long-term
    impacts of the SW distribution systems automation. The selected study area of
    the present study is a controversial irrigation district in central Iran, a basin
    where reported socio-economic and environmental concerns are among the highest
    in Iran. Of particular interest are the impacts of modernization and automation
    project –from both technical and environmental perspectives– in enriching the
    resilience of agricultural water distribution systems influenced by the water
    shortage periods. Accordingly, this study aims at (1) quantifying the vulnerability
    of conventional SW distribution systems under water shortage scenarios, (2) quantifying
    water loss reduction after modernizing conventional operating systems to automatic
    ones, (3) developing an automated SW distribution control system to reduce GW
    extraction from the aquifer by integrating the automatic operation system (SW)
    and the numerical model developed for GW, and (4) presenting short- and long-term
    plans to reduce GW extraction from aquifers, including extraction reduction level
    and location, by applying the developed model. It is worth noting that the developed
    model of the present study –automatic SW distribution system integrated with the
    GW numerical model– can employ other irrigation districts in other countries.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Conceptual model of the study The present study
    is associated with different components, such as surface water distribution system,
    control system, and groundwater model. The integration of these components into
    a system is presented in Fig. 1 and explained within the following steps: Download

    Conceptual model of the present study research. Step 1 (Field Study): Field surveying
    took11 months and included measurements, interviews, and brainstorming meetings,
    and two primary data categories were collected. The first category includes surveying
    the SW distribution canal networks and hydraulic structures information on agricultural
    water rights for each region. The second category includes information on the
    operational and observation wells, including the time series of the water level
    of the measured well, well type, electro-motors, and energy consumption of pump
    stations. -Step 2 (Hydraulic/Operational Simulation Model): This step includes
    i) developing the flow hydraulics simulation model in open canals, and ii) developing
    the automatic control system. In this component, the control model is integrated
    with the hydraulic model to be able to assess the control command (i.e., the water
    level regulators'' adjustments) impacts on the hydraulic condition of the canal
    system. Step 3 (Spatial Analysis of Surface Water Distribution): The appraisal
    performance indicators of adequacy and dependability were calculated, and the
    ArcGIS investigated their spatial distribution. Step 4 (Groundwater Modelling
    Systems) the groundwater simulation model in GMS was developed to i) identify
    the critical subunits with the over-exploitation from the aquifer and ii) to assess
    the automation impacts in the short and long term. This component is integrated
    with the automatic control system. Section 2.3.2 and Eq (10) explain the detail
    of the model''s integration. Step 5 (environmental Benefits): Determining the
    environmental advantages of employing the automated water distribution system
    to reduce water extraction from aquifers and short- and long-term energy consumption
    under normal and water shortage scenarios. Step 6 (practical results): Presenting
    a practical map that can be employed for the periodic inspection of the pumping
    stations and control the groundwater exploitation in each station. 2.2. The study
    area of the present study The study area, Nekooabad Irrigation Districts, is in
    the Central Iranian Plateau with an arid climate and located between the latitudes
    32°18′ and 32°50′ N and the longitudes 50°53′ and 51°42′ E. According to meteorological
    and hydrological information, the region''s average annual temperature, precipitation,
    and evaporation are 14.6 °C, 175 mm, and 2231 mm with the maximum, minimum, and
    mean measured water levels of 1860, 1560, and 1630 m, respectively. The studied
    aquifer, Najafabad alluvial aquifer, has a thickness of 63.5 m and spreads across
    941 km2 of land; and bedrock mainly consists of shales from the second geological
    era, classified as ductile rocks. At the maximum, the bedrock contour reaches
    1800 m in the northwestern part of the region, while at the minimum, it reaches
    1400 m in the central area. The mean length of bedrock contour is about 1600 m
    (GBR, 2016). Table 1 reports the annual GW budget components of the Najafabad
    aquifer, and Fig. 2 displays the study area and the location of the SW distribution

    The MODFLOW code modeled the GW behavior of the study area as the most reliable
    and widely used code for simulating the GW level by the finite difference methods.
    The sharpest hydraulic gradient is found on the northwest side of the aquifer,
    which decreases moving toward the south and east. The aquifer mesh was entered
    into the model as a 500 m⨯500 m grid. In this aquifer, 17 inflow cross-sections
    were selected, through which 49.6 mcm of water entered the aquifer. A monthly
    time step (interval) and stress period were considered for solving differential
    equations. There is no GW outflow from the aquifer due to the overexploitation
    of GW resources and the cone of depression. Therefore, the water year from October
    2015–2016 with the minimum fluctuations was considered the steady-state interval,
    and the water year from November 2015–2016 to September 2017–2018 was used for
    transient calibration of the model. Water is pulled from 9700 wells throughout
    the region, most of which populate the central parts of the aquifer. Further,
    the water table was estimated based on the data collected from 40 observation
    wells and was calibrated for both steady-state and transient conditions. 2.3.
    The simulation model for conventional and automatic SW distribution systems 2.3.1.
    The conventional SW distribution operation model The conventional SW distribution
    method used in the irrigation networks of most countries is to plan agricultural
    water distribution based on daily accessible water from SW resources (Babaei et
    al., 2018). In this case, water is accessible through direct extraction from rivers
    or water released from the agricultural region''s reservoir dam upstream (close
    or far away). Under these circumstances, the only measure taken is the daily water
    volume delivered to the agricultural region. Surface water distribution among
    sub-regions is planned by determining the time and settings of hydraulic structures
    (water-level regulating structures and intake structures) considering the volume
    of supplied water. An expert team carries out planning with several years of experience
    operating SW distribution systems, who are adequately familiar with problematic
    points and social conflicts (often between farmers upstream and downstream of
    the agricultural region). As a result, the water right of each sub-region is constant
    (based on agreements in the past decades or centuries) or is determined annually
    based on agreements between the representative of farmers and water distribution
    system managers (Shahdany et al., 2013). Considering the need to avoid any complexity
    and the significance of fast training and easy operation of agricultural networks
    by operators, inspired by the successful implementation of automatic SW distribution
    systems, the simplified integrator-delay (ID) analytical model is employed, hydraulic
    simulation model (Hashemy et al., 2016). In the ID model, each open canal reach
    includes the uniform flow with the characteristic delay time ( ) and the backwater
    curve with the characteristic storage level ( ). These characteristics are obtained
    from Eqs. (1), (2) under normal and frequency analysis modes. The water level
    in each canal reach can be calculated from Eq. (3) (Hashemy Shahdany et al., 2019):
    (1) (2) (3) In the equation, (m3 s−1), (m3 s−1), t (sec) and τ (s), , s, (m2),
    h (m), (m3 s−1) are represents the inflow to the canal reach, the inflow influenced
    by the delay time and entering the storage area, the time, the delay time, Laplace
    operator, Laplace variable, reservoir area, water depth, and the outflow discharge
    from the canal reach, respectively. The indicators of RMSE, CRM conducted the
    calibration and verification of the developed ID model, and MAE (Yaltaghian Khiabani
    et al., 2020, Zafra-Cabeza et al., 2011) evaluate the model accuracy by comparing
    the simulated water level time series generated by the ID model and the measures
    of the observed value during the field study. 2.3.2. Automatic SW distribution
    operation model According to the conventional automatic SW distribution methods
    in most irrigation networks, the agricultural water demand is defined for the
    controller as a predetermined external component. The sensor measures the volume
    of supplied water as the input to the controlled system and the upstream boundary
    condition at the beginning of the network. Each controller in decentralized control
    methods adjusts its adjacent water regulation structure downstream of each canal
    reach. After adjusting the water level and establishing the design depth in each
    canal reach, the off-take structure can be opened for water delivery manually
    by an operator or automatically by a controller. Given the single-objective nature
    of decentralized control methods in which each controller can only regulate a
    hydraulic structure and interactions of settings are neglected, different centralized
    control methods and algorithms have been extensively used in automation and modernization
    projects of agricultural water distribution systems (Rodriguez et al., 2020).
    The centralized model predictive controller (CMPC) was used as the automatic operation
    control system. The literature confirms the ability of the CMPC in realizing various
    operational objectives of agricultural water distribution systems (Maestre et
    al., 2014, Maestre et al., 2013). Therefore, the modified configuration of the
    CMPC was developed in this study. Compared with the typical configuration, the
    output of GMS is integrated with CMPC as the decision support model. In the typical
    configuration of the CMPC method, the state-space model (Eq. (4)) was used to
    provide an internal model for simulating flow hydraulics in temporal horizons
    and compacting the multivariable formulation of a linear model: (4) where represents
    the status matrix that its elements include inflow discharge to the canal reach
    and discharges affected by the delay time and the water level error, i.e., the
    difference between the measured and reference water levels, shows the vector of
    controlled variable discharge variations, is the disturbance matrix formed of
    water rights of catchments in a controlled water distribution system, which is
    considered an input to the system. , , and are weight matrices. Eq. (5) shows
    the expanded version of Eq. (3) for a canal reach of the water distribution system
    with a catchment (Hassani et al., 2019). (5) where , , , and are parameters of
    the status matrix representing the controlled discharges released from the regulating
    structure upstream of the canal reach at time steps k, k-1, k-2, and k-3, respectively.
    In this canal reach, the delay time between the water entrance from upstream and
    the change in the water level downstream of the first canal reach equals three
    time steps. , , and respectively represent the minimum, maximum, and reference
    allowable water level. where e1(k) is the water level error and represents the
    status variable added to the system, including the soft constraint caused by violation
    of the water level from the maximum and minimum levels in the first canal reach.
    This variable was added to the system to eliminate the gradual error of the controller
    when the controlled water level violates the reference water level. The auxiliary
    variable lacks a physical interpretation but is only a hypothetical variable to
    apply further penalty on the objective function. The error caused by the deviation
    of the water level is subtracted from the reference water level to achieve . The
    soft constraints get involved in the optimization by including an auxiliary status
    variable ( ) –in each canal reach– and at the same time an auxiliary controlled
    variable ( ). The auxiliary variables are calculated by Eq. (6) (Barkhordari et
    al., 2020): (6) Eq. (7) expresses the objective function in the CMPC: (7) where
    J, X, Q, U, and R respectively represent the objective function, status matrix,
    the matrix of corresponding coefficients of status variables, the matrix of controlled
    variables by the controller (water inflow from the end of each canal reach is
    converted to hydraulic structure opening/closing using a slave controller), and
    the matrix of corresponding coefficients of controlled variables. The extended
    form of the objective function can be expressed by applying the auxiliary status
    variable in the objective function as Eq. (8): (8) where and are matrices including
    the relative weights on the auxiliary status variables in the canal reaches. The
    above equations show the development of the typical configuration of the CMPC.
    The modified configuration of this control system is developed for the first time
    in this study to distribute surface water for minimizing water extraction from
    the aquifer. The primary assumption in this model is the extraction of groundwater
    when farmers do not receive adequate surface water timely in a stable manner.
    Eleven months of frequent field visits and interviews (1311 interviews) with farmers
    confirmed this assumption holds for about 73% of farmers in the study area. Eq.
    (9). was derived accordingly, and the modified configuration of the CMPC control
    system was developed: (9) where , , , , , , and respectively represent the operation
    time step in the automatic control system (sec), sub-regions in the agricultural
    region receiving water from each catchment in the main irrigation canal, surface
    water shortage (m3 s−1), agricultural water demands (m3 s−1), unreliable water
    distribution (m3 s−1), the SW distribution adequacy index, and SW distribution
    dependability index. The adequacy and dependability indicators for each catchment
    (off-take) are calculated from Eq. (10). (10) , , , , , , and are the adequacy
    indicator (%), dependability indicator (%), operational time (sec), the total
    number of off-takes located along with a canal, delivered water to each off-take
    (m3 s−1), water demand in each off-take (m3 s−1), and coefficient of variation
    of the time series, respectively. Water overexploitation from the aquifer in each
    sub-region is calculated from Eq. (11), where an agricultural sub-region includes
    hundreds of farms that their SW demand is supplied from off-takes in each canal
    reach: (11) where , , , and respectively represent groundwater extraction (m3s−1),
    groundwater overexploitation m3s−1) in each sub-region, the total number of wells
    in each sub-region, and extraction from wells in the region that their daily work
    hours were collected through field studies. The penalty of the weight matrix–the
    loop linking CMPC and GMS–is calculated as follows: (12) where equals the weight
    coefficients of the status variables and , which are respectively, the status
    variable corresponding to the water level error and the auxiliary status variable
    added to the status matrix to apply the soft constraint for optimization in each
    operational time step in the jth reach of the water distribution canal. According
    to the modified configuration of the developed CMPC, a more significant penalty
    is assigned to groundwater overexploitation in these regions than other sub-regions.
    Unlike the conventional CMPC in which there is no priority for water delivery
    to off-takes in the water distribution canal, and the controller only focuses
    on the lack of violation of the water level from the reference level of each canal
    reach, the prioritization in this configuration forces the controller to deliver
    water to sub-regions where water overexploitation occurs. 3. Computational results
    The computational results are discussed in this section on (1) quantifying SW
    distribution in the canal to evaluate the present performance of the SW distribution
    system and justify the need for promoting the performance of this system using
    an automatic control system, (2) evaluating the present status of the aquifer
    in the study area, and (3) improving SW distribution and reducing water extraction
    from aquifers after promoting the performance of the SW distribution system by
    the model developed in this study. 3.1. The performance of the SW distribution
    system under present conditions The statistical indicators, including the root
    mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of residual mass (CRM), and the mean absolute
    error (MAE), were calculated and analyzed to calibrate and validate the flow hydraulics
    simulation model (ID model). Analyses were carried out by simulating the 11-month
    operational period during which the inflow discharge to the canal and the discharge
    distributed between off-takes in the study were measured. Accordingly, 75% of
    the period was used for calibration and the rest (25%) for validation. According
    to the results, MAE, CRM, and RMSE for the calibration period were respectively
    0.89, −0.001, and 0.99. The corresponding values for the validation period were
    1.03, −0.009, and 1.05 confirming the acceptable accuracy of the model. The present
    performance of the SW distribution system was evaluated under three operational
    scenarios representing variations of the inflow flow to the canal under normal
    and water shortage conditions. There is a normal scenario among the three operational
    scenarios, in which the water volume released from the reservoir dam upstream
    of the agricultural region equals the agricultural water right. There are also
    two water shortage scenarios of 15% and 30%, with an occurrence probability of
    41% and 24% based on daily measurements in field studies. The simulation model
    calculates the evaluation indicators of the water distribution performance, including
    the adequacy and dependability indicators at 15-min intervals, and the daily means
    of these indicators for each sub-region are reported in Table 2. The results showed
    the downtrend desirability of the adequacy of SW distribution from upstream to
    downstream of the canal, indicating the ineffectiveness of the conventional agricultural
    water distribution system. Under the normal operational scenario in which the
    inflow water to the canal equals the total agricultural water demand, the SW distribution
    adequacy is not reliable, except for three upstream off-takes so that for the
    downstream off-takes 9–13, it can only receive 68% of the water demand on average.
    The dependability indicator shows a worse situation so that agricultural water
    is delivered stably to only an off-take, and the delivered flow was fluctuating
    in other cases. The adequacy and dependability indicators confirm the vulnerability
    of the traditional water distribution system regarding the adequate and stable
    distribution of agricultural water. Table 2. Variations of daily performance indicators
    of adequacy and dependability of SW distribution during the 11-month simulation

    UR: Un-Reliable; SC: Sub-Catchments; NR: Not Reached (i.e., the hydraulic simulation
    model was not able to complete the simulation and reach to a specific value).
    The agricultural water distribution system is more vulnerable under two water
    shortage scenarios so that only 7 and 4 sub-catchments reasonably received surface
    water respectively in 15% and 30% scenarios, and other sub-catchments received
    less than 60% of the water rights. These results indicate the reason for groundwater
    extraction in the study area, where farmers inevitably compensate for water shortage
    by water extraction from the aquifer. In conventional SW distribution methods–upstream
    control–the distribution priority is given to upstream sub-catchments so that
    any water shortage during the operational period directly affects midstream and
    downstream. In addition to the upstream control nature, water is inefficiently
    distributed under water shortage conditions due to significant losses in non-automatic
    water distribution methods because of the impossibility to coordinate the positive
    and negative movement times along the canal with the setting time of hydraulic
    structures. 3.2. Evaluating the present status of the aquifer The groundwater
    was modeled, and the calibration was conducted in steady-state and transient conditions
    based on the observation data, which is the Najafabad aquifer’s water table, measured
    using 40 observation wells. The mean value of specific yield (S) was determined
    as 10% for the studied aquifer considering the wells'' hydrodynamic coefficients
    and the pumping test results. According to the water budget information – gathered
    from the Isfahan Regional Water Organization during the fieldwork– the mean hydraulic
    conductivity (k) is about 15 m per day, considered as the initial hydraulic conductivity.
    Accordingly, the hydraulic conductivity was calibrated using data from September
    2015 for the steady-state conditions and data from September 2015– August 2018
    for the transient state. First, the k (mean value of 15 m per day) and then the
    S (mean value of 10%) were included by the model before calibration. According
    to this aquifer database, the k varies from 1.5 m/day to 38 m/day, and the S varies
    between 2 and 20% in different parts of the Najafabad aquifer. The specific yield
    was calibrated under transient conditions. The simulation results for the groundwater
    status showed that the steady and unsteady computational errors were respectively
    0.07 and 0.035 for ME, 0.73 and 0.93 for RMSE, and 0.53 and 0.79 for MAE. The
    observed and calculated GW levels for observation wells were plotted, some of
    which are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, there is an insignificant difference
    between the observed and calculated water levels, indicating the capability of
    the simulated model in predicting the GW level. Download : Download high-res image

    status of the aquifer, data collected in the field study, including measured data
    and data collected from relevant organizations, were analyzed. According to the
    analyses, groundwater extraction from active wells in the SW distribution system
    including deep wells (about 13% of wells have a depth>120 and 25.88% a depth of
    90–120 m), semi-depth wells (21.24% of wells have a depth of 60–90 m), and shallow
    wells (15.55% of wells has a depth of 30–60 m and 23.99% have a depth of less
    than 30 m), indicating over-exploitation from 65% of deep wells consuming more
    energy for water extraction from the aquifer. However, shallow wells account for
    17% of the total water extraction from the aquifer. This section discusses the
    results of applying the automatic control system to improve the SW distribution
    process and compares it with the current status of the system and the results
    of quantifying reduced water extraction from the aquifer and energy saving. The
    second section presents the practical results. The potential of the modified configuration
    of the automatic distribution system (CMPC) was simulated in 11 months under normal
    and water shortage operational scenarios. The simulation results are presented
    in Table 3 in the form of the adequacy and dependability of water distribution.
    Comparing these results with those in Table 2 on the current status of water distribution
    indicates the high efficiency of the automatic control system in the effective,
    adequate, and steady distribution of surface water among sub-catchments. Table
    3. Variations of daily performance indicators of the adequacy and dependability
    of SW distribution during an 11-month simulation and the qualitative analysis
    of SW distribution after automating the SW distribution system. Note: R: Reliable;
    SR: Semi-Reliable; UR: Un-Reliable; SC: Sub-Catchments. The notable point is the
    high capability of CMPC in controlling fluctuations in all canal reaches so that
    the dependability index is always reasonable, and even under severe water shortage
    scenarios, the water distribution process–which is 25–37% less than the water
    demand–reliably occurs. Variations of the adequacy indicator from upstream to
    downstream–compared with the current status in Table 2–indicate the significant
    improvement of fair water distribution between the upstream and downstream sub-catchments.
    Ensuring the reliable distribution of part of water demand even in water shortage
    scenarios by the SW distribution system guarantees reduced water extraction from
    wells by farmers. 3.3. Practical results and discussion Computational results
    were presented in the previous section. The results are zoned to present the results
    more concretely and further discuss the practical results. In other words, to
    precisely calculate water overexploitation from the aquifer and evaluate the efficiency
    of the automatic control system developed in this study, the results on the performance
    of SW distribution across the irrigation network were presented in the form of
    spatial zoning maps in GIS. In this way, the present groundwater overexploitation
    and reduced water extraction from the aquifer after promoting the SW distribution
    system were determined for each well drilled in the region based on the following
    steps: • The efficiency of SW distribution: water delivered to each sub-catchment
    under present conditions and after automation was calculated and presented as
    the adequacy and dependability of water distribution. • According to (Kamrani
    et al., 2020), an efficiency of 65% was considered for SW distribution in sub-canals
    of the network, and the adequacy of distributed water was calculated at sub-catchments.
    • Indicators calculated in the previous step using the IDW tool in ARC-GIS were
    extracted to generate the zoning map of the adequacy of SW distribution. • The
    efficiency of automation in reducing groundwater extraction and resulting energy
    saving was calculated using the correlation presented by comparing the adequacy
    of surface water distribution before and after automation with water extracted
    from each well. Fig. 4 displays the spatial scattering of the average adequacy
    indicator of water distribution before and after automation under normal (A, G),
    moderate water shortage (B, H), and severe (harsh) water shortage (C, I) scenarios.
    Fig. 4I, H, and G show the effect of automation on the fair distribution of water
    between sub-catchments from upstream to downstream of the study area. Similarly,
    Fig. 4 also shows the improved dependability of SW distribution under different
    operational scenarios using the automatic control system (J, K, L) compared to
    the conventional system (D, E, F). According to the above results, unlike the
    conventional water distribution system–upstream control–in which only upstream
    catchments more appropriately operate, the automatic control system fairly distributes
    SW shortage supplied to the network among consumers. The results of spatial zoning
    for the adequacy and dependability of SW distribution were used to quantify reduced
    water extraction from the aquifer, determine energy-saving, and present an applied
    map for reduced working hours of wells to be used by operational teams in regular
    inspections. To quantify water extraction reduction, the volume of water reliably,
    adequately, and steadily replacing groundwater extraction by the automatic SW
    distribution system is determined for each well and used as an input to the groundwater
    simulation model. Fig. 5 displays the simulation results of the aquifer behavior
    due to improved SW distribution in 5-year short-term and 10-year long-term periods.

    of the automation of SW distribution-as aquifer storage and recovery method, on
    the aquifer water level uprise. Other factors affecting the uprise of the aquifer
    water level in the simulation period, including precipitation rate, feeding rate,
    and discharge rate of the aquifer, are considered constant. Only the effect of
    reducing water extraction from the aquifer was investigated. Accordingly, the
    gradual increase in the GW level is only affected by the automation of SW distribution.
    Accordingly, the use of the modified configuration of the CMPC developed in this
    study caused an uprise of 0.1–2.2, 0.2–3.2, 0.4–3.9, 0.7–6.9, 1.5–9.1, and 3.8–13.5
    m in the aquifer water level, respectively, within 12, 2, 36, 48, 60, and 120
    months. The results show the outstanding capability to automate the SW distribution
    system as practical aquifer storage and recovery method. The distinct difference
    between the method developed in this study and other aquifer storage and recovery
    methods is its efficiency based on the potential to improve the SW distribution
    system. In the method developed in this study, water extraction reduction from
    each well in the agricultural region was determined based on water replaced by
    improving the SW distribution system, and the automatic control system delivers
    surface water to different sub-regions by prioritizing water extraction reduction
    from the aquifer. The environmental results obtained from executing the automatic
    water distribution system in this study regarding quantification of water extraction
    from the aquifer and energy saving are summarized below: Normal operation • Groundwater
    discharge of the aquifer after one year: 701503610 m3 • Water extraction reduction
    from the aquifer after one year: 123911502 m3 equivalent to 16% reduction • The
    average water level uprise: 6.6 m in the short term (5-year period) and 10.94
    m in the long term (10-year period) • Reduction of working hours of wells: deep
    wells (>90 m): 52%, semi-deep wells (30–90 m): 24%, and shallow wells: 5% • Reduction
    of annual energy consumption (caused by reduced water over-extraction from the
    aquifer): 81%. Energy consumption after automatization reached 44,415,948 kWh
    but was 236,141,090 kWh before automatization. Moderate water shortage operation
    • Groundwater discharge of the aquifer after one year: 731825823 m3 • Water extraction
    reduction from the aquifer after one year: 94062775 m3 equivalent to 12% reduction
    • The average water level uprise: 4.9 m in the short term (5-year period) and
    8.72 m in the long term (10-year period) • Reduction of working hours of wells:
    deep wells (>90 m): 47%, semi-deep wells (30–90 m): 19%, and shallow wells: 1%
    • Reduction of annual energy consumption (caused by reduced water over-extraction
    from the aquifer): 59% Severe (harsh) water shortage operation • Groundwater discharge
    of the aquifer after one year: 743033053 m3 • Water extraction reduction from
    the aquifer after one year: 82402965 m3 equivalent to 10% reduction • The average
    water level uprise: 3.8 m in the short term (5-year period) and 7.12 m in the
    long term (10-year period) • Reduction of working hours of wells: deep wells (>90
    m): 38%, semi-deep wells (30–90 m): 16%, and shallow wells: 1% • Reduction of
    annual energy consumption (caused by reduced water over-extraction from the aquifer):
    49% The combined surface water and groundwater allocations in the study area using
    the developed automated operating system resulted in a 16%, 12%, and 9% reduction
    in groundwater extraction in the normal, moderate, and severe water shortages
    scenarios. In other words, the allocated surface water to the irrigation districts
    kept constant within the three operational scenarios (i.e., normal, moderate and
    severe water shortages scenarios) and the water distribution operating system
    automation resulted in 16%, 12%, and 9% operational losses reduction. These conserved
    water volumes play as a new surface water source for the irrigation district.
    Accordingly, the surface water allocation process to the irrigation districts
    has not been changed. However, the annual groundwater resources portion decreased
    by 123,911,502 m3 and reached 701,503,610 m3 in the normal operational scenario,
    decreased by 94,062,775 and reached 731,825,823 m3 in the moderate water shortage
    scenario, decreased by 82,402,965 and reached 743,033,053 m3 in the severe water
    shortages operational scenarios. To demonstrate the applicability of the results,

    map shows the potential of each region in reducing the working hours of pumping
    stations after 5 and 10 years of implementing the modified configuration of the
    CMPC. This map can be used as a roadmap by monitoring and inspection teams for
    monitoring groundwater extraction and applying penalties to farmers in overexploitation
    regions. Comparing the results of this study with those in the literature indicates
    the distinct feature of the aquifer’s storage and recovery developed in this study
    in terms of application–implementation in different agricultural regions in countries
    with semi-arid climate–and stability–constant water distribution in short- and
    long-terms. This can be related to reduced water extraction by a systematic method
    considering the potential of water extraction reduction in different sub-regions
    of an agricultural region. Constant and same water extraction reductions were
    considered in the literature for all wells in the aquifer region under extraction
    reduction scenarios. For example, Sheikhipour et al. (2018) introduced 5 and 10%
    water reduction scenarios for all wells. Kharanagh et al. (2020) proposed 1, 1.5,
    2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5% aquifer storage and recovery scenarios were introduced to
    reduce water extraction from all tube wells. Malmir et al. (2021) introduced integrated
    aquifer storage and recovery scenarios–constant 5 and 10% water extraction from
    wells by farmers and 10 and 20% reduction of cultivation area–to improve the aquifer
    status and investigate its short- and long-term effects. 4. Conclusion For the
    first time in this study, a practical, systematic method was introduced as an
    aquifer’s storage and recovery scenario employed in all agricultural regions worldwide.
    This method integrates surface water and groundwater resources for irrigation.
    Underground over-extraction reduces static reserves of the aquifer. By identifying
    critical sub-catchments due to water overexploitation from the aquifer, intensified
    deepwater drilling, or deepening to increase the depth of wells, the configuration
    developed in this study gave the priority of SW distribution under normal and
    water shortage operational conditions from the groundwater modeling results by
    the GMS model in MODFLOW. The proposed method enables water authorities to promote
    the SW distribution system in practical, implementable, and step-by-step planning
    to reduce water extraction from wells based on the actual water reduction potential.
    The lack of a systematic method to evaluate the reaction of farmers to the reduction
    of water extraction from wells is among the main limitations of this study. The
    basic assumption in this study was the partial reliable (adequate and dependable)
    replacement of surface water delivered to farmers by water extraction from the
    aquifer. Hence, further studies should be conducted on how farmers help the successful
    implementation of this improvement strategy. It is suggested that by integrating
    an agro-economic model with the conceptual model of this study, in addition to
    this concern, the effect of public sector policy-making should be further studied
    by applying supplementary policies such as the reduction of energy subsidies to
    the agricultural sector or energy pricing in agricultural regions for rehabilitating
    critical aquifers in agricultural regions. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  explanation: This research article describes the design, implementation, and assessment
    of an aquaponics system in an urban setting to address food insecurity. The system
    integrates fish farming with plant cultivation, utilizing a closed-loop system
    for water and nutrient management. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility
    and effectiveness of this technology in addressing food access and nutritional
    needs in communities facing food insecurity.
  extract_1: According to Yogev et al [9], aquaponics systems have an increased yield
    when compared to traditional agriculture for comparable sizes of land. Because
    this community-sized aquaponics system maximizes subsystems, including the pump
    and solar panels, while minimizing the need for added work by the staff and volunteers,
    replicating the system in additional locations, including at locations intended
    for housing insecure may be possible.
  extract_2: Lastly, this type of system requires less space for a higher yield of
    produce and does not require soil and can therefore be implemented in urban settings,
    where traditional farming may not be feasible.

    IEEE Conference Location: Seattle, WA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Situated in
    the heart of Silicon Valley, San Jose is a hub of technology and development;
    however, one of the greatest issues in this area is food insecurity. Defined as
    the state of having unreliable access to nutritious foods that allow someone to
    live healthily and happily, food insecurity is often linked to low-income status
    and location [1]. Although Silicon Valley is one of the wealthiest areas in the
    nation, one in four children live below the poverty line [2]. A Hunger Study demonstrated
    that within Santa Clara County, 44% of children and 12% of seniors are inflicted
    with hunger, with 20% of all people considered food insecure [3]. Lack of access
    to nutritious foods leads to physical ailments, such as obesity and malnutrition,
    and to mental health problems, including stress and anxiety [4], [5]. The United
    States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service identified several
    areas of San Jose as low income with limited access to nutritious foods, making
    this area a prime location for reducing food insecurity and alleviating the associated
    health disparities [6]. Low-income communities may not be able to afford nutritious
    food or may live in areas without healthy options, known as food deserts. A solution
    to this issue has been the implementation of urban agriculture, which gives communities
    autonomy over the food process [7]. Designs for urban agriculture systems are
    often closely coupled with prioritizing social equity and reducing environmental
    impact to support healthy, sustainable, food secure communities [8]. One solution
    to address urban food insecurity is providing agency for urban farming. This includes
    introducing new techniques for farming in small space and limited resources, including
    aquaponics, an integrated farming system. Aquaponics combines aquaculture and
    hydroponics, building a symbiotic relationship between fish, plants, and nitrifying
    bacteria to create a nitrogen cycle that optimizes plant growth [9]. The fish
    generate ammonia in their waste that the nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert into
    nitrate to nourish the plants. The plants then remove other chemicals and oxygenate
    the water for the fish. This cyclical and interdependent system reduces water
    and conventional fertilizer usage compared to traditional farming. A successful
    aquaponics system can help increase food agency which can reduce hunger and the
    burden of buying fresh produce, which in many cases, can be both inaccessible
    and expensive. Oftentimes, the opportunity to know where one''s food comes from
    is an overlooked luxury and returning this agency is both socially and economically
    empowering. In addition, in urban environments of Silicon Valley with little arable
    land, aquaponics can be implemented in unconventional locations. On a larger scale,
    aquaponics systems can augment traditional farming because the technology has
    the capacity for growing plants more densely, on non-arable land, and outside
    of traditional growing seasons. This system is also resilient to droughts and
    floods from climate change, since they function independent of fluctuating environmental
    conditions. When observing the issues presented by food insecurity in the greater
    San Jose area and the opportunities for aquaponics to alleviate some of the stressors
    associated with life at or below the poverty line, combining the two is an opportunity
    to mitigate aspects of food insecurity for area residents. Thus, a self-maintained
    aquaponics system was designed and built as a pilot project and case study at
    Loaves and Fishes Family Kitchen, a local soup kitchen. The goal of the system
    is to test the feasibility of a monitored aquaponic system in an urban environment
    and to expose volunteers at the farm to the technology. SECTION II. Methodology
    A. System Design In partnership with the Loaves and Fishes Family Kitchen, the
    team designed an aquaponics system to fit the available space at Father Larry''s
    farm, a half acre volunteer run farm that provides supplemental fresh fruits and
    vegetables to Loaves and Fishes. The components of the current design builds on
    a previous Santa Clara University design for an aquaponics system in rural East
    Africa [10]. From lessons learned in East Africa, the system was expanded to a
    larger scale. A model of the design for the system in San Jose is shown in Figure
    1. The design combines a number of elements that set it apart from conventional
    commercial aquaponics systems. The system was designed to be modular for easy
    scaling, low-maintenance through sensor-monitoring, and off-the-grid through solar
    panels. The system consists of two media grow beds where the nitrogen-fixing bacteria
    populate, two raft grow beds where the majority of the plants grow, and a fish
    pond. The total water volume of the system is 1,500 gallons. Fig. 1. Side view
    of aquaponics system showing layout and elevation changes. Show All The fish pond
    was dug below ground to help maintain temperature year-round and house Black Mozambique
    Tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, chosen because the species can provide an additional
    protein source. Tilapia species are hardy, adaptable, and produce a large amount
    of waste for their size, making them a good choice for aquaponics systems [11].
    The pond holds 650 gallons and is equipped with an air pump to oxygenate the water.
    Water flow through the system is driven by a 92 W Hydrofarm Active Aqua Submersible
    water pump with a maximum head of 12 feet. As shown in Figure 2, the pump moves
    water from the fish tank up 8 feet to the two media grow beds. Based on volume
    of the system and requirements for nutrient cycling and filtering, the flow rate
    of the pump is 650 gallons per hour. The media-filled grow beds provide 26.7 square
    feet of growing space and are constructed out of large Intermediate Bulk Containers
    (IBCs). The media beds were planted with tomatoes (?) Each contains two bell siphons
    that act as mechanical timers on the grow beds to establish a flood and drain
    cycle that helps oxygenate the water and plant roots. The design allows for flooding
    and draining of the media grow beds to occur every 15 minutes. When the bell siphons
    are activated water drains from the media beds into the raft grow beds where plant
    roots are submerged into the nutrient rich water and held in place with floating
    rafts. The raft beds were seeded with a variety of leafy vegetables including
    spinach, kale and a variety of lettuce. The water from the raft beds flows by
    gravity back into the fish pond to complete the cycle. Fig. 2. Water flow diagram
    of aquaponics system Show All The addition of an IoT network of sensors collect
    water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, and water level
    data every five minutes. The sensors are powered by the solar panels and data
    transmitted to the web by LoRa (Long Range), a wireless data communication technology,
    to a nearby warehouse, where a router will upload the information to the internet.
    Through a web-based platform, farmers at Loaves & Fishes and the team at Santa
    Clara University will be able to remotely monitor the system, reducing maintenance
    required to check on the system. The entire system, including the pump, aerator
    and data monitoring sensors is powered by eight 117.5 W First Solar photovoltaic
    modules with 3.725 kWh lead-acid battery storage to store additional energy and
    power the system throughout the night. Optimizing space at the farm, the solar
    panels will be attached to the roof of a nearby shed with underground wire connecting
    the different electrical components. Besides the battery as a form of energy storage,
    an MPPT Renogy Charge Controller will be used to maximize the output from the
    solar panels and control the flow of electricity between the panels, the battery,
    and the inverter, which converts the current from DC to AC, allowing the pumps
    to function. The power system is designed for the aquaponics system to continuously
    operate for over 24 hours without any solar energy generated. B. Data Collection
    In addition to the data collected using the IoT network of sensors, the goal of
    which is to communicate overall health of the system in the long term, data on
    plant growth and water quality in the system is being collected as the system
    establishes. Once per week root lengths are measured in the raft bed, and the
    number of sprouted and mature plants are counted and recorded. Mature plants are
    those that have multiple leaves, many stranded roots, good color and a higher
    chance of survival. Water quality measurements including temperature, pH, dissolved
    oxygen concentration, ammonia concentration and nitrate concentration are measured
    using the HACH Surface Water Test Kit at the same frequency as plant measurements.
    SECTION III. Outcomes A. Data Results Construction of the system as outlined in
    the Methodology section was completed and 32 Black Mozambique Tilapia placed in
    the pond in beginning of May 2019. The first raft grow bed was seeded on May 16,
    2019 with 275 total seeds. Details of seed type are detailed in Table 1. In grow
    bed 1, after 8 weeks 49.35% (105 plants) survived and are mature. Figure 3 shows
    the average root length over time. Note that all lettuce varieties were combined
    into one average for each date. The lettuce varieties show steady increase over
    time but growth was initially slow. There were several circumstances that occurred
    at the beginning of the grow period that led to slow growth. On May 20, the impeller
    to drive the motor shut down and the system was shut down for three days. On June
    4, the inverter blew due to heat and the system was shut down for four days. Additionally
    on June 11–12, 2019, San Jose experienced a heat wave with temperatures above
    100 degrees. Fig. 3. Average root length of plants in raft grow bed 1 from one
    week after planting through July 12, 2019. Show All Table I. Seed type and count
    planted in raft grow bed 1 in May 2019. A small portion of the second grow bed
    was seeded with buttercrunch lettuce on May 9, 2019 and by June 25, 69% of the
    lettuce was mature and had an average length of 4.1 inches. However, by July 12,
    2019 the buttercrunch lettuce was dead. The rest of the grow bed was seeded with
    spinach, iceberg, romaine and kale on June 13, 2019. Table 2 shows the growth
    of root length in the month of data available. Water quality data parameters collected
    with the HACH surface water quality kit are shown in Table 3. The pH has remained
    relatively high in the initial startup phase but with time, as fish begin to grow
    and mature, is stabilizing. Water quality data will continue to be collected as
    system stabilizes and the nitrogen cycle establishes. Table II. Root length (inches)
    of plants in raft grow bed 2. Table III. Water quality parameter measurements
    in the aquaponics system at Larry''s farm. B. Lessons Learned The system with
    the design considerations discussed was constructed at Father Larry''s Farm, in
    partnership with Loaves and Fishes Family Kitchen, a soup kitchen and meal delivery
    service for the vulnerable populations of Santa Clara County. The populations
    served include those experiencing homelessness, low-income seniors, and the working
    poor. Working with over 30 other non-profits throughout the Bay Area, Loaves and
    Fishes delivers upwards of 12,000 meals each week [2]. This partnership with Loaves
    and Fishes, and in particular the volunteers at Father Larry''s Farm, is by far
    one of the most successful outcomes of this project. Finding a nonprofit and volunteers
    with similar goals to the University team has been invaluable. In addition to
    working with Father Larry''s Farm, the project has benefited from donations from
    First Solar and labor donations from CBF Electric who have committed to helping
    to oversee the safe installation of the power system - a vital part of the system.
    Although the establishment of partnerships has been a success, the project faced
    a number of roadblocks during the design and construction of the aquaponics system,
    and understanding these roadblocks could be useful similar projects. The first
    set of obstacles dealt with the location of the farm and aquaponics system. The
    farm is in an industrial area parking lot with no access to electricity or internet.
    Therefore, the entire system, including all the sensors, needed an off-the-grid
    energy source and an alternative IoT communication system to upload information
    online. Both of these challenges were overcome in the design phase by securing
    additional solar panels and deciding to use LoRa Technoogy for data transmission
    to the internet While considerable effort was made to build the system at low
    cost, certain materials may make this system cost-prohibitive for some communities.
    Since the project was funded by grant money and community donations, the team
    had to be creative in choosing materials. For example, the clay pebbles optimal
    for the media bed cost 800butthisprovedtobetooexpensivesolavarocksatapriceof 198
    were purchased instead. As another example, the solar components were donated
    to the project by First Solar but would have cost $1200 (including installation).
    In addition, this project had a short time frame (7 months) due to the academic
    year and with more time could further benefit from local industry partnerships
    and donations. Despite the challenges and construction delays due to a wet Northern
    California winter, this project was completed (Figure 4). In partnering with Loaves
    and Fishes, and tailoring an aquaponics system to their needs as a small non-profit,
    there is the opportunity to help address food insecurity in Santa Clara County.
    This entails supplementing Loaves and Fishes'' produce with increased nutrient
    yields consistently enough that the nutrient composition of their meals is equally
    elevated and maintained for the populations they serve. Fig. 4. Photo of nearly
    completed construction of the aquaponics system. Show All SECTION IV. Discussion
    Many residents in the urban areas of San Jose experience food insecurity due to
    housing and/or job instability, poverty, as well as lack of access due to food
    deserts. One possible solution to this food insecurity is to increase urban agriculture,
    but this must be done in limited land and water resources. To test the viability
    of aquaponics as one of the solutions for food agency, a quality, off-the-grid,
    large-scale aquaponics system with over 90 square feet of growing space, a 650-gallon
    fish pond, and four types of sensors to transmit water quality data to the internet
    was designed and is constructed in downtown San Jose. The end goal is to test
    the technology in the urban environment and begin to expose more people to urban
    agriculture and different food growing technologies. The impact of this aquaponics
    system will be measured by comparing produce yield and growth time between the
    aquaponics system and the same produce grown on a similar sized plot of land on
    Father Larry''s Farm. Additionally, the user experience of stakeholders at Father
    Larry''s Farm will be surveyed. This long term goals of the project is to supplement
    food grown and increase nutrition content provided by Father Larry''s traditional
    agriculture garden and identify additional locations where similar systems can
    be constructed. According to Yogev et al [9], aquaponics systems have an increased
    yield when compared to traditional agriculture for comparable sizes of land. Because
    this community-sized aquaponics system maximizes subsystems, including the pump
    and solar panels, while minimizing the need for added work by the staff and volunteers,
    replicating the system in additional locations, including at locations intended
    for housing insecure may be possible. Intended is a system that will increase
    the nutrient value of Loaves and Fishes meals, without increasing operating costs.
    The produce grown in the aquaponics system will supplement the harvests from Loaves
    and Fishes traditional farming units. Measurement of growth output will be done
    with sustainability in mind: understanding whether a plant is optimally grown
    in the aquaponics system or should remain “traditional” can help to make their
    entire farm more efficient. The system, which can operate outside of seasonal
    bounds, has the potential to maintain a nutritional standard throughout the year
    and in years when water is more scarce due to drought conditions. Vegetables to
    be grown include leafy greens (swiss chard, kale, spinach) and tomatoes. These
    leafy greens were selected because they have been recognized for their capacity
    to grow successfully in aquaponics systems [12]. Food sovereignty is the idea
    that people have the right to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced
    through ecologically sustainable methods. On the local level, this community-based
    aquaponics system will yield produce that is locally-sourced and grown sustainably
    using solar power and decreased water compared to traditional agriculture. Increased
    access to leafy greens and other vegetables that are high in vital nutrients can
    aid in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes which are prevalent
    in food insecure communities. Since the produce will be grown without fertilizer,
    the negative health impacts of unnatural additives will also be eliminated. Lastly,
    this type of system requires less space for a higher yield of produce and does
    not require soil and can therefore be implemented in urban settings, where traditional
    farming may not be feasible. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Larry Vollman and

    management system, leveraging end-to-end automated operations to optimize water
    resource use and enhance agricultural productivity. The system integrates IoT,
    machine learning, and cloud computing to collect real-time data from sensors,
    analyze water consumption patterns, and automatically adjust irrigation schedules
    based on crop needs. By reducing water wastage, improving crop yields, and enabling
    remote monitoring, this approach supports sustainable agriculture practices and
    increases farm efficiency.

    In recent decades, fierce competition in a globalized economy has drawn further
    attention to the subject of Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) (Goodarzian et
    al., 2023). It can be applied to achieve improved environmental performance and
    cost management in businesses and organizations (Hajiaghaei-Keshteli & Sajadifar,
    2010; Hajiaghaei-Keshteli et al., 2011). SCND is a strategic decision revolving
    around issues such as the number and location of facilities, type of transportation
    vehicles, vehicle routing, etc. (Tavana et al., 2022). The objective of this is
    to minimize costs and improve the environmental and social benefits of a supply
    chain (Tirkolaee et al., 2022). As a result, SCND plays a vital role in a wide
    range of industries, including food and agriculture. An Agricultural-Food Supply
    Chain (AFSC) consists of a number of facilities and processes, each with its own
    unique structures, that use a range of inputs and resources to produce agricultural
    products and deliver them to customers de Carvalho et al. (Carvalho et al., 2022).
    Due to the growing population in the world, the subject of AFSC has attracted
    much attention in recent decades (Gholian-Jouybari et al., 2023a). Moreover, waste
    management is particularly important in AFSC (Tirkolaee et al., 2022). According
    to the (FAO, 2019), each year, approximately 14% of the global food production
    worth 400 billion dollars is wasted between harvest and retail markets. Additionally,
    retailers and customers waste approximately 17% of food products each year. According
    to FAO, 2020, citrus fruits are among the most widely produced and consumed fruits
    in the world (Fig. 1). Globally, these fruits are grown in approximately 140 countries,
    and their production has increased since 2011. Citrus fruits are primarily produced
    in Asia, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 Global citrus fruit production 2011–2019
    (FAO, 2020) Full size image Fig. 2 World production of citrus fruits by region
    in 2020 (in thousand metric tons) (Statista, 2020) Full size image Citrus fruits
    are commonly packaged in plastic crates due to their low cost and ease of access,
    and they are widely used in the industry. Figure 3 shows the trend in the use
    of plastic packaging in the UK. The fruits wasted throughout such supply chains
    can be used as valuable input to produce plant fertilizers (particularly vermicompost)
    (Ducasse et al., 2022). Fig. 3 Sales volume of plastic boxes, cases, crates, and
    similar articles for carrying or packing goods in the United Kingdom between 2010
    and 2018 (Statista, 2020) Full size image The circular economy (CE) is an economic
    philosophy that emphasizes sustainability aspects and is gradually replacing the
    linear economy (Kabadurmus et al., 2022; Sarkis et al., 2023). The core idea of
    CE is to preserve the value and quality of materials and energy as much as possible
    (Lotfi et al., 2022a; Sharma & Malaviya, 2023). These can be acquired through
    reduction, reuse, and recycling processes in order to reduce the extraction of
    raw materials and non-renewable resources and move towards zero waste (Neves &
    Marques, 2022). The transition toward CE is driven by a range of factors, including
    population growth and urbanization, the availability of funds for this type of
    economy, and the increase in resource consumption (Mallick et al., 2023; Rebolledo-Leiva
    et al., 2023). With the integration of the notion of the circular economy into
    the field of supply chains, a new type of supply chain network has emerged, known
    as the Circular Supply Chain (CSC) (Hernandez Marquina et al., 2022; Saraji &
    Streimikiene, 2022).In a CSC, the flows of materials/goods in the main supply
    chain and its sub-chains are linked through closed-loop, open-loop, and reverse
    logistics in such a way as to provide sustainability benefits in economic, environmental,
    and social dimensions and facilitate the transition from a linear economy to a
    CE (Lotfi et al., 2023; Taddei et al., 2022). In Fig. 4, an overview of a CSC
    is presented based on the supply chain network structure of Farooque et al., (2019).
    All levels of a CSC utilize circular flows that involve reuse, recycling, and
    reduction. Materials/goods flow in a CSC network are supported by a series of
    open-loop supply chains, which link the main supply chain with the sub-chains
    and a number of closed loops. According to Farooque et al., (2022), CSC network
    design can have a significant impact on an organization''s cost and economic performance.
    As shown in Fig. 5, nearly half of all companies around the world are considering
    transitioning to a CSC in the near future. Fig. 4 Structure of circular supply
    chain network Full size image Fig. 5 Strategy of supply chain firms to integrate
    circular economy practices worldwide in 2019 (Statista, 2020) Full size image
    Designing a supply chain network constitutes a formidable task (Lotfi et al.,
    2021). In the context of CSCs, several challenges manifest, encompassing the intricate
    relationships among network members, the absence of a structured platform for
    effective information sharing, and the lack of a well-defined framework for the
    seamless implementation of CE principles. Additional noteworthy challenges in
    the design of CSC networks comprise economic and operational risks, the intricacies
    associated with product complexity, the dearth of established governmental rules
    and regulations, and potential cultural barriers (Bressanelli et al., 2019; Lotfi
    et al., 2022b). This paper aims to delve into the domain of CSC network design
    concerning citrus fruits, considering the challenges previously outlined. It has
    been noted that a literature gap exists in the realm of CSC network design specifically
    tailored for these fruits. Consequently, the primary objective of this study is
    to forge a circular citrus supply chain network, offering a comprehensive perspective
    on the cycles of product/material flow throughout supply, distribution, sale,
    and recycling, aligning with CE principles. Remarkably, this marks the inaugural
    application of CE principles to the design of a supply chain network. The key
    contributions and innovations of this research are succinctly summarized as follows:
    Proposing a multi-loop structure consisting of two open loops and one closed loop
    for the supply chains of citrus fruits, plastic crates, and plant fertilizer,
    Presenting a mixed-integer linear programming model for citrus supply chain network
    design based on the principles of CE and the three dimensions of sustainability,
    Evaluating and comparing the performance of the citrus supply chain in linear,
    closed-loop, and circular networks, Considering the principles of CE in the design
    of the supply chain network, including 3R (Recycling, Reuse, and Reduction), Using
    the Forensic-Based Investigation algorithm (FBI), Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), and
    Boosted Genetic Algorithm (BGA) to optimize the proposed model, Taking into account
    the economic dimension by minimizing costs, the environmental dimension by reducing
    carbon emissions and water consumption, and the social dimension by considering
    stepwise capacity buildup for manufacturers and producers. The rest of this paper
    is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature regarding AFSC. The
    problem definition and mathematical model are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4
    explains the solution methods. There are several numerical examples and comparisons
    of the solution methods in Sect. 5, as well as sensitivity analyses for the key
    parameters of the problem and an examination of the performance of different SCND
    models. Finally, Sect. 6 details the conclusions and discusses the remaining gaps
    that should be addressed in future research. 2 Literature review Since the subject
    of this study is the design of AFSC networks, this section presents an overview
    of recent studies on this subject. 2.1 Agricultural-food supply chain network
    design Given the amount and variety of food products produced and consumed every
    day, the dependence of food supply chain networks on how these networks are designed
    is based on these varieties. Hence, the subject of AFSC network design has received
    extensive attention from a great number of researchers. Many of them have tried
    to optimize these networks with the tools of operations research. In a study by
    Banasik et al. (2016), they presented a linear integer programming model for designing
    closed-loop supply chain networks for mushrooms. Their multi-objective model optimizes
    the network in a deterministic space in order to minimize production costs, transportation
    costs, and environmental impacts. Using a probabilistic multi-objective model
    for meat supply chains, Mohammed and Wang (2017) attempted to minimize transportation
    costs, vehicle numbers, and delivery times. Motevalli-Taher et al., (2020) proposed
    a mathematical model for the design of a four-echelon wheat supply chain network.
    This model pursues supply chain network sustainability in all three dimensions
    by trying to minimize total cost and water consumption and maximize job opportunities.
    Kambli and McGarvey (2020) presented a robust integer programming model for a
    three-echelon food supply chain network, which tries to minimize the distance
    traveled at different echelons of the supply chain. In a study by Rahbari et al.,
    (2020) on the red meat supply chain network, they proposed a multi-period, multi-product
    mathematical model for a linear supply chain network structure, which minimizes
    the network costs, including the cost of renting refrigerators for storage and
    transport purposes. Salehi-Amiri et al., (2021) presented a linear integer programming
    model for designing a closed-loop walnut supply chain network, whereby the production-related
    waste generated in the entire structure of the supply chain network is managed.
    In a study by Purnomo et al., (2022a) on the design of a fish supply chain network,
    they stated that one of the major challenges in this field is the perishability
    of the product. They proposed a linear integer programming model for the closed-loop
    network structure, which minimizes the total network costs while managing fish
    waste at all echelons of the supply chain. Salehi-Amiri et al., (2022) formulated
    a mathematical model for a closed-loop network, which minimizes the cost of the
    entire network (for the economic dimension) and maximizes generated employment
    opportunities (for the social dimension). This model also manages avocado waste
    and waste generated from its by-products throughout the supply chain. In a study
    by Baghizadeh et al., (2022), they proposed a mathematical model for designing
    a supply chain network for strawberries, which is a highly perishable product.
    The objective of this model, which has a fuzzy formulation, is to maximize profit
    and minimize energy consumption, water consumption, and delivery time. (Dündar
    et al., (2022) presented a multi-period, multi-product model for the wheat supply
    chain, where the goal is to minimize the cost of transportation at different echelons
    of the supply chain. Li et al., (2022) explored the subject of designing a rice
    supply chain network to maximize profits and minimize carbon emissions. Kabadurmus
    et al., (2022) proposed a mathematical model for the CSC network with the purpose
    of reducing food waste in urban settings. In a study by Gholian-Jouybari et al.,
    (2023a), they proposed a model for AFSC network design in the presence of uncertainty
    considering the marketing applications. Their model covers the three dimensions
    of sustainability by optimizing total profit, water consumption, and customer
    satisfaction. They also examined their model in the stochastic space to improve
    its practical applicability. A summary of the reviewed studies is presented in
    Table 1. Table 1 Literature review of agri-Food supply chain network design Full
    size table 3 Research gaps The previous section presented a review of research
    literature in the field of AFSC network design. As shown in Table 1, researchers
    have proposed a variety of different structures for AFSC networks and have mostly
    tried to include all three dimensions of sustainability in their formulations.
    The issue of waste management in the design of supply chain networks is one of
    the most important subjects in this field. However, most supply chain network
    design models are based on linear economy and thus have a major weakness in ignoring
    the possibility of waste management. Furthermore, despite the great importance
    of CE, it has rarely been considered in the previously proposed supply chain network
    structures. Regarding the product perspective, a limited number of studies have
    delved into the intricacies of citrus fruit supply chains. Notably, the work by
    Goodarzian et al. (2023) stands out as the sole endeavor proposing a closed-loop
    supply chain network structure tailored to citrus fruits. However, it is essential
    to highlight that this prior research, represented by Goodarzian et al., exclusively
    addresses the recycling and reuse of discarded fruits. In contrast, our current
    model transcends these limitations by incorporating all three principles of CE
    into CSC network design. This innovative approach extends waste management considerations
    beyond just discarded fruits to encompass plastic crates as well. Contrary to
    the previous related works, this is the first study in the literature on the design
    of an AFSC network for citrus fruits with the CE approach in pursuit of triple
    sustainability objectives. In the proposed model for circular citrus fruits supply
    chain design, the generation of fruit waste, the use of plastic crates, and the
    consumption of plant fertilizer in fruit orchards are managed simultaneously.
    After presenting the proposed integer linear mathematical model, the paper applies
    the forensic-based investigation algorithm (FBI), red deer algorithm (RDA), and
    Boosted genetic algorithm (BGA) to solve the model. 4 Problem statement The purpose
    of this study is to examine how the CE approach can be integrated into the design
    of an AFSC network for citrus fruits. An overview of this proposed network is
    presented in Fig. 6. The designed network consists of a main chain for citrus
    fruits (I) and two sub-chains for plastic crates (II) and plant fertilizer (III).
    Fig. 6 Proposed circular supply chain network structure for citrus fruits Full
    size image In the main chain (I), citrus fruits are harvested from orchards (I1).
    One of the most important inputs of these orchards is fertilizer, which is used
    to strengthen and preserve trees. The produced fruits are packed in crates, which
    are mostly made of plastic. Citrus fruits can also be imported from abroad (\\(I2\\))
    to address shortages in domestic supply, improve product quality, or achieve higher
    variety. The imported fruits are mostly transported in pre-packaged plastic crates.
    All fruits are transported to wholesalers (\\(J\\)), where a percentage of them
    are lost and transferred to waste collection centers (\\(N2\\)). Similarly, waste
    plastic crates are transported to plastic crate collection centers (\\(N1\\)).
    In each period, wholesalers decide, based on demand size, to send fruits to retailers
    (\\(K\\)) or hold them in inventory for subsequent periods. The fruits that are
    sent to retailers are delivered to end- customers (\\(C\\)). After consuming the
    products, end- customers return the plastic crates to crate collection centers
    (\\(N1\\)) and transport the wasted fruits (if there are any) to waste collection
    centers (\\(N2\\)). The crates collected in collection centers (\\(N2\\)) are
    transported to recycling centers (\\(R\\)), where they are divided into two groups:
    1. Crates that can be reused are washed and prepared for reuse. It is assumed
    that recycling centers use a water treatment mechanism that allows water to be
    used more than once in order to significantly reduce water consumption. 2. Crates
    that cannot be reused are transferred to crate manufacturers in sub-chain II to
    be used as raw materials. The first echelon of sub-chain II consists of plastic
    crate manufacturers (\\(P1\\)), which either purchase their raw materials or use
    waste crates collected from the main supply chain (\\(I\\)). The produced plastic
    crates are transported to the next echelon, which consists of plastic crate distributors
    (\\(D1\\)). In this echelon, depending on customers'' demand, crates are either
    transferred to orchards (\\(I1\\)) and other markets (\\(M1\\)) or kept in inventory
    for use in subsequent periods. The highest echelon of sub-chain (III) consists
    of fertilizer producers (\\(P2\\)), which acquire their raw materials in two ways:
    (1) waste collected in the collection centers (\\(N2\\)), (2) purchase from other
    suppliers. The produced fertilizers are transferred to the next echelon, which
    consists of fertilizer distributors (\\(D2\\)). These distributors transport fertilizers
    to orchards (I1) or other markets (\\(M2\\)), depending on the amount of demand.
    However, they can also store fertilizers for use in subsequent periods. The goal
    of the CE is to maximize the utilization of available material resources. This
    goal can be achieved through three basic principles: reduce, reuse, and recycle.
    In the supply chain network of this paper, which is drawn in Fig. 6, the three
    principles of the CE are implemented as follows: 1. Reduce (CE1): Plastic crate
    recycling centers (\\(R\\)) make use of a water treatment mechanism to allow the
    water used in the washing of the crates to be reused multiple times. This mechanism
    will significantly reduce the water consumed in the washing process. 2. Reuse
    (CE2): A percentage of plastic crates collected throughout the supply chain are
    transferred from recycling centers (\\(R\\)) to orchards (I1) for reuse. 3. Recycle
    (CE3): In this supply chain network, recycling is done in two ways: (i) recycling
    of plastic crates for use as raw materials in the manufacture of new crates; (ii)
    recycling of fruit waste for use in the production of plant fertilizer (vermicompost).
    In addition, the following assumptions are considered in the circular AFSC network
    design. Each facility has a limited capacity. Each facility has a specific known
    location. All related parameters are deterministic, and their value is available
    at the start of the planning horizon. Citrus fruits, plastic crates, and plant
    fertilizers can only be stored in the respective distribution centers. Shortages
    are not allowed. Crate and fertilizer production capacities increase step by step
    depending on the production output. 4.1 Mathematical modeling This section presents
    the proposed mathematical model for the circular citrus supply chain network design.

    the model is provided in Table 2. Table 2 Indices, parameters, and decision variables

    constraints of stepwise capacity buildup for plastic crate manufacturers. 5 Solution
    methods This section presents several methods for solving the proposed mathematical
    model. First, a description of the encoding and decoding scheme is provided. Next,
    the proposed solution methods are expressed, including the exact and approximate
    approaches. Since the supply chain network design is of NP-hard class (Gholian-Jouybari
    et al., 2023a; Vali-Siar & Roghanian, 2022), several meta-heuristic algorithms,
    including FBI, RDA, and BGA, are implemented to optimize the proposed model in
    large-scale instances. 5.1 Encoding and decoding To use the meta-heuristic algorithms,
    each solution must be formulated as a matrix. The solution representation scheme
    used in this study is a matrix where the number of rows is equal to the number
    of periods, and the number of columns is equal to the problem dimension, which
    is given by Eq. (50). The cells are random numbers between zero and one. The general
    structure of the solution representation is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 The structure
    of solution representation Full size image $$Problem Dimension=\\beta +c+{i}_{1}+{i}_{2}+k+j+{n}_{1}+{n}_{2}+{d}_{2}+{m}_{2}+{n}_{1}+r+{p}_{1}+{d}_{1}+{m}_{1}+r$$
    (50) The decoding of the solution string follows the following rules: Rule 1.
    At each level, the higher priority is with larger numbers. Rule 2. A value greater
    than 0.5 indicates that the corresponding facility will be set up, and less than
    0.5 indicates the opposite. To better understand the encoding and decoding process,
    An example of the solution representation is provided in Fig. 8, and the decoded
    equivalent of this solution is presented in Fig. 9. In this solution, the numbers
    indicate the priority of the facility. “number-s” indicates that the facility
    will be set up with the specified priority, and “o” indicates that the facility
    will not be set up. In this example, according to part \\(c\\), there are two
    end- customers: \\(C2\\), which is the top priority customers in the first period,
    and \\(C1\\), which is the top priority customer in the second period. Fig. 8
    An example of solution representation Full size image Fig. 9 An example of encoding
    the solution representation Full size image In the first period, the demand of
    the second customer is initially supplied by the second orchard. If the supply
    of the second orchard is not enough to meet this demand in its entirety, the remaining
    demand will be supplied from other orchards. The third and fourth orchards will
    be processed in the same manner until the demand of the second customer is completely
    satisfied. After that, the process moves to the first customer, which is the second
    priority. Other allocations are performed in the same way. 5.2 Boosted genetic
    algorithm (BGA) Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the early and capable algorithm
    in optimization (Golshahi-Roudbaneh et al., 2017). It is based on the genetic
    evolution of living organisms throughout successive generations and specifically
    how newborns inherit the superior genetic characteristics of their parents. It
    also considers the possibility of mutations in some genes. In this algorithm,
    these natural processes are represented by crossover and mutation operators. Research
    has shown that the genetic algorithm can be applied to solve a wide variety of
    problems, including the supply chain bi- and multi-objective problems, Fard and
    Hajiaghaei-Keshteli (2018), closed-loop supply chain network designs, Sahebjamnia
    et al., (2020), and sustainable supply chain planning, Gholian-Jouybari et al.,
    (2023b). In this research, GA is used with some modifications to solve the proposed
    circular citrus supply chain network design problem. The first modification made
    in the algorithm is in the crossover process, in the sense that one-point, two-point,
    and uniform crossover operators are randomly applied in two ways. (i) crossover
    to two random chromosomes from the current generation, (ii) crossover to one random
    chromosome and the best chromosome of the previous generation. Furthermore, eight
    different types of mutation operators are randomly applied in each iteration.
    A brief introduction to these mutation operators is provided below: Type 1: Changing
    the values of a random cell of chromosomes according to Eq. (51): $$New Value
    = 0.8+0.2*rand (\\mathrm{0,1})$$ (51) Type 2: Changing the values of a random
    cell of chromosomes according to Eq. (52): $$New Value=0.2+0.8*rand (\\mathrm{0,1})$$
    (52) Type 3: Changing the values of a random cell of chromosomes according to
    Eq. (53): $$New Value= rand (\\mathrm{0,1})$$ (53) Type 4: Substituting all values
    in a randomly selected row of a chromosome into all other rows of that chromosome.
    Type 5: Swapping the value of two randomly selected cells in each row of the chromosome.
    Type 6: Changing the values of all cells in a random column of chromosome according
    to Eq. (51). Type 7: Changing the values of all cells in a random column of chromosome
    according to Eq. (52). Type 8: Sorting orchards in the ascending order of the
    rate of production cost, and sorting wholesalers based on their minimum distance
    from orchards. The pseudocode of the proposed boosted genetic algorithm is presented
    in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 Pseudo code of proposed boosted BGA Full size image 5.3 Red
    deer algorithm (RDA) Introduced by Fathollahi-Fard et al., (2020), the red deer
    algorithm is inspired by the behavior of red deer during the mating season. This
    algorithm first generates a population of deer and divides them into two groups:
    males (stags) and females (hinds). It then runs several operators called Roar,
    Fight and Mate and selects the best deer according to a fitness function. After
    running each operator, a control and correction function is applied to avoid infeasible
    solutions. The pseudocode of this algorithm is presented in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 Pseudo
    code of RDA algorithm Full size image 5.4 Forensic-based investigation (FBI) algorithm
    FBI algorithm was introduced by Chou and Nguyen (2020). This algorithm is inspired
    by the process of investigation, location, and pursuit of the suspect by police
    officers. One of the major advantages of this algorithm is that it is parameter-free.
    This algorithm consists of two phases: Phase A, which is related to the investigation,
    and phase B, which is related to the pursuit. These two phases are performed by
    the investigation team and the pursuit team, respectively. In the first phase,
    all of the suspected locations are investigated, the worst locations are updated,
    and the target locations are identified. In phase B, target locations are carefully
    searched, and those locations where the chances of reaching the suspect are higher
    are further examined. Finally, the algorithm ends if the suspect is identified;
    otherwise, the phases are repeated. Since this algorithm is parameter-free, it
    does not require the parameter tuning process. The pseudocode of the FBI algorithm
    is given in Fig. 12. Fig. 12 Pseudo code of FBI algorithm Full size image 6 Results
    This section presents the numerical results utilized to evaluate and analyze the
    performance of the model and solution methods. First, the model validation is
    analyzed and a description of the test problems and how problem parameters were
    set is provided, and finally, a comprehensive comparison of different solution
    methods is provided. 6.1 Model validation The purpose of this section is to present
    the results of the validation of the proposed model using randomly selected parameters.
    The dimension-related details of the problem used for this purpose are given in
    Table 3. A summary of other model parameters is provided in Table 4. The mathematical
    model has been coded in GAMS and solved with the CPLEX solver. The solution of
    the model for the first period is drawn in Fig. 13. Table 3 Dimensions of example
    for evaluating the proposed model Full size table Table 4 Example parameters for
    evaluating the proposed model Full size table Fig. 13 Graphical solution for validation
    example in the first period Full size image As observed in Fig. 13, the problem
    has three end- customers (\\(c1\\)-\\(c2\\)-\\(c3\\)) in the main chain. The demand
    of these three customers is met by the second orchard (\\(i1\\)-2) and the first
    import (\\(i2\\)-1). The products from both sources are then transported to wholesalers
    (\\(j\\)-1) with their own waste rates. In this echelon, wasted fruits are collected
    by the first waste collection center (\\(n2\\)-1), and their plastic crates are
    collected by the second and third collection centers (\\(n1\\)-2) and (\\(n1\\)-3).
    Next, the fruits are distributed to the retailers (\\(k\\)-1) and (\\(k\\)-2)
    and finally delivered to end- customers. At the end- customer echelon, fruit waste
    and plastic crates are collected by the set of collection centers. The collected
    crates are transferred to the first and second recycling centers (\\(r\\)-1) and
    (\\(r\\)-2). From there, waste crates are transferred to the crate manufacturer
    (\\(p1\\)-1) and reusable crates are transferred to the second orchard. The crate
    manufacturer uses the received waste crates as raw materials to produce new crates
    in order to meet the demand of other markets (\\(m1\\)-1). The produced crates
    are transported to the crate distributor (\\(d1\\)-1) and from there to other
    crate markets. The waste collected by the first waste collection center (\\(n2\\)-1)
    is transported to the fertilizer producer. Considering the demand for fertilizer,
    which comprises the demand of the second orchard and that of other fertilizer
    markets, in the first period, the producer sends the fertilizer to the fertilizer
    distributor (\\(d2\\)-1). The fertilizer is distributed to the second orchard
    and other fertilizer markets depending on the demand. The solution of the model
    for the second period is drawn in Fig. 14. Fig. 14 Graphical solution for validation
    example in the second period Full size image In the second period, fruit waste
    collection centers, plastic crate collection centers, and recycling centers were
    set up in the same way as in the first period. In this period, the first orchard
    (\\(i1\\)-1) has also been activated to meet the customer demand in the main supply
    chain. Other good flows and distributions are similar to the first period. 6.2
    Parameter tuning for metaheuristic algorithms The algorithm parameters were fine-tuned
    utilizing the well-established Taguchi method, and you may read more about Taguchi
    Method in Gholian Jouybari et al. (2016), Gholian-Jouybari et al., 2018, Bahadori-Chinibelagh
    et al., 2022). This methodology enables the determination of optimal parameter
    values, allowing an algorithm to yield its best results through a limited number
    of trials, as opposed to testing all conceivable combinations. The application
    of the Taguchi method was executed using Minitab v.21.1, with three value levels
    considered for each parameter. The selection of these values was informed by the
    authors'' insights into algorithm behaviors derived from numerous trial-and-error
    experiments. Given that the objective function pertained to minimization, the
    Taguchi method was implemented in the \"smaller-the-better\" mode. The specific
    levels chosen for each parameter can be found in Table 5. Table 5 Parameter levels
    of metaheuristic algorithms Full size table The best choice was determined to
    be an \\({L}_{9}\\) array for BGA and an \\({L}_{27}\\) array for RDA. The result
    of the method for BGA is plotted in Fig. 15A. The best choices for the first,
    second, and third parameters of this algorithm were determined to be the third,
    third, and first levels, respectively. The result of the method for RDA is presented
    in Fig. 15B. For this algorithm, the best choices for the first to fifth parameters
    were determined to be the second, third, first, third and first levels, respectively.
    Fig. 15 SN ratios of BGA and RDA parameters Full size image 6.3 Comparison of
    solution methods 6.3.1 Test problems The test problems are divided into three
    categories: small, medium, and large. The generated test problems are listed in
    Table 6, and the values chosen for problem parameters are based on Table 4. Table
    6 Numerical test problems Full size table In order to evaluate the solution method,
    the solution time (CPU time), objective function value, and convergence rate is
    used. The convergence rate, which was only obtained for meta-heuristic algorithms,
    was determined using Eq. (54): $$CONV=\\frac{\\sum_{itr}({fbest}_{i-1}-{fbest}_{i})}{{Max}_{itr}}$$
    (54) where \\({fbest}_{i}\\) is the value of the objective function in the \\(i\\)-th
    iteration of the meta-heuristic algorithm, and \\({Max}_{itr}\\) is the total
    number of iterations. This index measures how much the value of the objective
    function has changed on average during iterations. 6.3.2 Small and medium-sized
    problems The small and median-sized problems were solved by the exact method using
    the CPLEX solver of GAMS \\(v25\\) as well as the meta-heuristic algorithms in
    Matlab \\(R2020a\\). A summary of the results is presented in Table 7. Moreover,
    the solution times of the meta-heuristic algorithms and the exact method are plotted
    in Fig. 16. Table 7 The computational results of small and medium examples Full
    size table Fig. 16 CPU time of GAMS-BGA-RDA-FBI Full size image The solution time
    of the exact method increases exponentially with increasing problem size, as shown
    in Fig. 16. As previously mentioned, such problems are classified as NP-hard in
    terms of time complexity. Since the big difference between the solution time of
    the exact method and that of meta-heuristic algorithms makes it difficult to compare
    the algorithms in this respect, for a better comparison, the solution times of
    meta-heuristic algorithms are plotted separately in Fig. 17. As can be seen, BGA
    has a shorter solution time than the other two algorithms, and this gap grows
    larger as the problem size increases. Fig. 17 CPU time of proposed meta-heuristic
    algorithms Full size image The objective function values obtained by different
    methods for different test problems are plotted in Fig. 18. The meta-heuristic
    algorithm with the least difference from the exact method in terms of objective
    function value is BGA. The mean difference between the objective function value
    of the exact method and that of meta-heuristic algorithms is 3% for BGA, 5.3%
    for RDA, and 5.7% for the FBI algorithm. Figure 19 compares the convergence of
    these three meta-heuristic algorithms. Fig. 18 Objective function values of proposed
    meta-heuristic algorithms Full size image Fig. 19 Convergence of proposed meta-heuristic
    algorithms Full size image According to Fig. 19, the FBI algorithm converged better
    for small problems, while the BGA algorithm converged better for medium problems.
    Generally, the proposed BGA has outperformed the other two algorithms in solving
    small and medium-sized problems. 6.3.3 Large-sized problems The solution time
    plots for small and medium-sized problems demonstrate this clearly. Thus, meta-heuristic
    algorithms were the only method of solving large-sized problems. The results of
    these solution methods are presented in Table 8. Moreover, the solution time of
    the three algorithms for large-sized problems is illustrated in Fig. 20. Table
    8 The computational results for large samples Full size table Fig. 20 CPU time
    of BGA-RDA-FBI algorithms Full size image According to Fig. 20, all algorithms
    increased their solution times when faced with larger test problems. However,
    there was only a small difference between BGA and RDA in this respect, and the
    FBI algorithm had the longest solution times for these problems. The fitness function
    values obtained from the algorithms are presented in Fig. 21. Moreover, the convergence
    of the proposed algorithms is illustrated in Fig. 22. Fig. 21 Objective function
    values of BGA-RDA-FBI algorithms Full size image Fig. 22 Convergence of BGA-RDA-FBI
    algorithms Full size image Across all test problems, the fitness function values
    derived from the BGA and the RDA exhibit notable similarities, consistently surpassing
    those obtained from the FBI, as depicted in Fig. 21. Evidently, BGA demonstrates
    superior convergence in all scenarios, establishing itself as the most effective
    algorithm. These findings unequivocally demonstrate the outperformance of the
    BGA proposed in this study compared to the other two algorithms. Consequently,
    the BGA is selected as the preferred algorithm for addressing the modeled problem.
    6.4 Sensitivity analysis To understand better how the model behaves in the case
    of a change in these parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed on several
    key parameters of the proposed model. The parameters considered in this analysis
    are the demand for citrus fruits, the carbon emission tax, the fruit waste rate
    at the end- customer level, and the plastic crate waste rate. This sensitivity
    analysis was performed using test problem No. 5, and involved applying changes
    to model parameters and obtaining the objective function values obtained from
    BGA. The results concerning customer demand are presented in Table 9. The trends
    of change in the objective function value are plotted in Fig. 23. Table 9 Sensitive
    analysis results of fruit demand Full size table Fig. 23 The effect of fruit demand
    changes on the total objective function Full size image Based on the results of
    Table 9, it can be concluded that increasing customers demand will increase the
    objective function value and vice versa. In addition to increasing transportation
    and setup costs, this change also reduces inventory holding costs. The results
    of the sensitivity analysis for carbon emission tax are presented in Table 1).
    The changes in the objective function value for this part of the analysis are
    plotted in Fig. 24. Fig. 24 The effect of carbon tax changes on the total objective
    function Full size image Based on the result in Table 10, reducing this tax reduces
    transportation costs and carbon dioxide emissions from production and transportation
    but increases production and set-up costs. A 10% increase in the carbon emission
    tax increases all costs except inventory holding and set-up costs, thus increasing
    the cost of the entire supply chain. Compared to 10%, a 20% increase in this tax
    leads to a relatively smaller increase in the total cost, which can be attributed
    to lower transportation and set-up costs. The results of sensitivity analysis
    for the fruit waste rate at the end- customer level are presented in Table 11,
    and the corresponding changes in the objective function value are plotted in Fig.
    25. Table 10 Sensitive analysis of carbon tax Full size table Table 11 Sensitive
    analysis of fruit waste ratio Full size table Fig. 25 The effect of fruit waste
    ratio changes on the total objective function Full size image The results of the
    sensitivity analysis of \\({\\alpha }_{3}\\) shows that an increase in this rate
    increases the cost of the entire supply chain and vice versa. Because of the increase
    in the number of fruit waste deliveries at the end customer level, this change
    results in a significant increase in transportation costs. The results of sensitivity
    analysis for the plastic crate waste rate are presented in Table 12, and the corresponding
    changes in the objective function value are plotted in Fig. 26. Table 12 Sensitive
    analysis of crate waste ratio Full size table Fig. 26 The effect of crate waste
    ratio on the total objective function Full size image Based on Fig. 26, the relationship
    between the changes in \\({\\gamma }_{1}\\) and the total cost of the supply chain
    is not linear. While a 10% increase/decrease in this rate increases (decreases)
    the cost of the entire supply chain, a 20% increase/decrease in this parameter
    has a negligible effect on the said cost. The reason for this is that this parameter
    has a direct relationship with the cost of purchasing raw materials for crate
    manufacturers, as well as an indirect relationship with the cost of transportation.
    6.5 Comparison of circular, closed-loop, and linear models This section compares
    the proposed supply chain network, which is based on CE principles, with closed-loop
    and linear supply chain networks. The purpose of this comparison is to highlight
    the merits of using a CSC network. Figure 27 shows the structure of the proposed
    CSC network, which comprises the flow of materials/goods in both closed loops
    and open loops based on the three principles of CE, with a mechanism of waste
    management for fruits as well as plastic crates. Figure 28 displays the corresponding
    linear supply chain structure, where the focus is on meeting demand and managing
    production, and there is no mechanism for waste management. Figure 29 shows the
    corresponding closed-loop supply chain structure, where the mechanism of waste
    management is only for plastic crates. The objective function values obtained
    with these structures are presented in Table 13. Fig. 27 The proposed circular
    supply chain network Full size image Fig. 28 A linear supply chain network derived
    from the proposed circular supply chain Full size image Fig. 29 A closed-loop
    supply chain network derived from the proposed circular supply chain Full size
    image Table 13 Objective function values of the circular, linear, closed-loop
    supply chain Full size table As shown in Table 13, the CSC has a lower total cost
    than the other two types of the supply chain. This cost difference originates
    from the cost of purchasing raw materials for crate manufacturers and fertilizer
    producers. In the CSC, waste products are used as cheap replacements for more
    expensive new raw materials due to the use of open-loop logistics. A comparison
    of closed-loop and circular supply chains shows that while they have similar carbon
    dioxide emissions, production, transportation, and inventory holding costs, the
    closed-loop supply chain has significantly higher facility set-up costs. This
    is because of the use of an open loop in the CSC, which allows it to use the capacity
    of the sub-chain to reduce the need for new centers. When comparing linear and
    CSC, it is apparent that the former has higher supply costs and is also more costly
    to produce due to carbon dioxide emissions. It indicates that, as expected, the
    linear supply chain is focused on boosting production. This chain lacks recycling
    and reuse processes, which results in higher costs than the CSC. Table 14 presents
    the results of all three types of supply chain networks in terms of fruit waste
    and plastic crate waste. Moreover, Table 15 shows the amount of water consumed
    in the recycling of plastic crates. Table 14 Waste of circular, linear, and closed-loop
    supply chain networks Full size table Table 15 Percentage of water saved by circular,
    linear, and closed-loop supply chain networks Full size table Based on the results
    in Table 14, the CSC has managed to reach zero waste in both categories, which
    is the ultimate goal of the CE. This achievement can be attributed to the use
    of recycling, reuse, and reproduction processes via open and closed loops throughout
    the supply chain. In comparison, the linear supply chain, which clearly does not
    benefit from 3-R, generates a significant amount of waste by restricting itself
    to treat used goods at the end of their life cycle as entirely disposable. Considering
    recycling and reuse processes, the closed-loop supply chain produces significantly
    lower amounts of plastic crate waste than the linear supply chain. However, the
    lack of open-loop in this supply chain means that all fruit waste will be fully
    discarded, wasting the opportunity for recycling. According to the results, the
    proposed CSC network has been able to reduce water consumption by 42% by equipping
    crate recycling centers with water treatment mechanisms. 7 Conclusions There is
    a wide range of industries and researchers interested in the design of supply
    chain networks. Supply chain networks designed optimally tend to offer significant
    benefits in terms of cost savings, environmental impact, and social significance.
    Additionally, it is applicable to the agricultural and food supply chains, which
    are of great importance due to their role in feeding the world''s growing population,
    the consumption of non-renewable resources, and the waste of food products. By
    integrating the CE approach throughout the supply chain, a CSC network design
    model for citrus fruits was presented in this paper. Additionally, the paper presented
    an integer linear programming model for the proposed network, which incorporates
    the three basic principles of CE. The findings derived from this study can be
    summarized as follows: The BGA exhibits quicker solution times than the other
    two algorithms for small and medium-sized problems, with a minimal 3% deviation
    from the exact method. Notably, for small problems, the FBI algorithm excels in
    convergence, while the BGA algorithm demonstrates superior convergence for medium-sized
    problems. In summary, BGA outperforms the other algorithms consistently across
    the spectrum of small and medium-sized problems. In the context of large-sized
    problems, when assessing Solution Time, BGA and RDA reveal only a marginal difference,
    while the FBI algorithm registers the lengthiest solution times. Both BGA and
    RDA consistently yield comparable and lower fitness function values than FBI across
    all test problems. When examining convergence, BGA consistently showcases superior
    convergence for all problems. According to the sensitivity analysis of customer
    demand, an upsurge in customer demand correlates with an increase in the objective
    function value. Regarding the consideration of Carbon Emission Tax, a 10% increment
    in the tax results in an overall cost increase, excluding inventory holding and
    set-up costs. Moreover, a 20% increase leads to a smaller overall cost rise due
    to reduced transportation and set-up costs. In the context of Fruit Waste Rate,
    an increase in the fruit waste rate at the end-customer level raises the overall
    supply chain cost. Similarly, when examining Plastic Crate Waste Rate, a 10% increase
    or decrease affects the cost of the entire supply chain, while a 20% change has
    a negligible effect. The CSC network demonstrates a reduced total cost when contrasted
    with both closed-loop and linear supply chain networks. This cost advantage emanates
    from the strategic use of waste products within the CSC, serving as cost-effective
    substitutes for conventional raw materials. The closed-loop supply chain incurs
    notably elevated facility set-up costs, primarily attributable to the absence
    of an open loop, a feature present in the CSC. Conversely, the linear supply chain
    experiences higher supply and production costs, mainly attributed to carbon dioxide
    emissions. Remarkably, the CSC attains a zero-waste outcome in both fruit and
    plastic crate categories by implementing comprehensive recycling, reuse, and reproduction
    processes. Incorporating a circular supply chain model for citrus fruits offers
    managers a strategic pathway toward sustainable and economically efficient operations.
    The numerical achievements of our study underscore the tangible benefits managers
    can expect. By achieving zero waste in plastic crate usage and fruit residuals,
    managers can enhance both environmental stewardship and operational efficiency.
    The substantial 42% reduction in water consumption not only aligns with corporate
    sustainability goals but also presents an opportunity for cost savings. Furthermore,
    our model showcases a noteworthy 3% decrease in carbon emissions, providing a
    clear avenue for managers to contribute to climate action while maintaining competitiveness.
    Importantly, the nearly 1% reduction in total costs in the circular supply chain
    compared to linear counterparts highlights the financial feasibility of embracing
    circular principles. Managers should consider the comprehensive comparative analysis
    presented, recognizing the superior performance of the circular model. The insights
    from sensitivity analysis on key parameters offer a practical guide for fine-tuning
    strategies. Overall, this study provides a direct and actionable roadmap for managers
    to navigate the integration of circular economy principles, fostering both sustainability
    and economic resilience in the dynamic landscape of supply chain management. In
    light of the fact that the model presented in this paper was formulated in the
    deterministic mode, it could be reformulated under uncertainty in future studies
    in order to deal with fluctuations in parameter values, such as customer demand,
    for better practical application. As the model has a single objective function,
    it is recommended to use a multi-objective formulation to allow the addition of
    additional environmental and social objectives. Data availability All data are

  description: Anaerobic digestion (AD) systems are prominent in low-and middle-income
    countries (LMICs), although their implementation within organic farms to enhance
    resource efficiency and “close the loop” has been limited. This paper thus reviewed
    existing literature on the potential of AD technologies as part of closed-loop
    rural family farming communities in LMICs. Data from eleven existing case studies
    matching this criterion was then collated to understand practical considerations
    of implementing and maintaining viable AD systems for small farmers. The case
    studies analyzed indicate that most, if not all, of the biogas produced in the
    AD process is used for household purposes such as cooking, lighting and heating.
    The AD systems are either based on the fixed biogas dome or the floating drum
    design, although the tubular flexible balloon model is mentioned as a low-cost
    alternative. Future research opportunities in this topic include studying the
    applicability of recommendations offered across different geographies, consideration
    of long-term sustainability and impact of biodigester technology, and sociocultural
    factors such as community ownership and indigenous practices.

    Organic agriculture is a method of farming that seeks to produce food with minimal
    impact to ecosystems, animals or humans [1]. It encompasses a number of environmentally
    friendly practices such as avoiding pesticide use, increasing abundance of species,
    increasing soil fertility, reducing soil erosion, and reducing energy usage and
    nitrogen (N) losses from the system [2,3,4,5,6]. As of 2019, organic agriculture
    systems covered 72.3 million hectares globally (about 1.5% of all global agricultural
    land). More than a fifth of all organic agricultural land is located in low- and
    middle-income countries that are recipients of official development assistance
    (ODA) [7]. This may be attributed to the often-limited access of small-scale farmers
    in such environments to chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, irrigation water
    and pesticides, caused by their lack of capital, infrastructure and market access
    [8]. In such a context, “closing the nutrient cycle”—recycling nutrients and organic
    matter—is a necessity, and innovation regarding this form of resource efficiency
    is hence a constant theme in the development of agriculture technology [9]. Closing
    the nutrient cycle can be directly connected with a range of rural organic farming
    challenges, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), leading to
    the requirement for holistic, closed-loop systems to improve agricultural productivity
    while also facilitating lasting sustainable development. With the integration
    of food production and upcycling of waste (agricultural, animal, food and human)
    into the water, sanitation and energy nexus, closed-loop systems promote Water-Waste-Energy-Food
    (WWEF) models. Sustainable decentralized technology recovering nutrients, water
    and energy from waste streams to provide clean streams, concentrated fertilizers
    and energy is a necessity in small-scale agriculture. Anaerobic digestion (AD)
    provides an opportunity to integrate waste management into food, energy and agricultural
    systems [10,11]. Agro-industrial waste generates three quarters of the potential
    of raw materials suitable for biogas production. The natural biodegradation of
    organic matter in anaerobic conditions releases between 590 and 800 million tons
    of methane into the atmosphere globally each year [12]. Such extensive potential
    leads us to consider different perspectives for biogas in various fronts, such
    as improving waste treatment processes of solids and sewage, the process of heat
    and energy, the purification of the product to make it compatible with the existing
    uses of natural gas, and in the chemical extraction. Biogas recovery systems convert
    various types of biomasses, taking advantage of the biogas released as an energy
    source. Challenges posed in the sector include the cost of technologies and, consequently,
    the dependence on incentives to leverage the market in LMICs for personal use,
    especially in small and medium-sized rural properties [13]. By definition, the
    AD process requires anaerobic conditions to guarantee the joint activity of an
    association of micro-organisms to transform raw organic material into methane
    (50–75% by volume) and carbon dioxide (25–50% by volume). Biogas may also contain
    small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3) and other trace gases.
    The biogas composition depends on the organic substrates and the type of AD technology
    used [14]. The process comprehends the four phases of hydrolysis, acidogenesis,
    acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Different groups of micro-organisms in synthrophy
    are required in each phase. The main environmental conditions of AD are the process
    temperature, pH and dry matter concentration (%), among others. However, the main
    aspect of an AD is the biodigester model used which has to be adapted to the environmental
    conditions, type of substrate, and available financial resources [15]. Agricultural
    waste, animal dung, among other organic effluents, can be used in the biodigester.
    The biogas can be directly applied for household cooking, or as fuel in lamps,
    or for internal combustion engines. For example, in Brazil, manure from two to
    four cows can produce 2 to 3 m3 of biogas to supply cooking gas for a family of
    five to six people. The digested material can fertilize 0.5 hectare of the property
    [16,17]. Under anaerobic conditions, biogas can be produced from most organic
    matter. The process efficiency is influenced by the used raw material and the
    complexity of the AD system, e.g., if temperature could be controlled or if a
    mixture system is available [16,17]. A decentralized biodigester is a small-scale
    biodigester that produces biogas which can be used as an energy source, while
    the sludge i.e., the digested waste, can be used as an organic, mineral-rich fertilizer
    [18]. This fertilizer and biogas can present a potential revenue stream for farms
    [19]. Figure 1 depicts a simplified flow diagram of closed-loop AD in agriculture.
    Apart from the environmental benefits, on-farm digesters are capable of creating
    energy security in agriculture while diversifying farm income and increasing employment
    opportunities [20]. Figure 1. A summary flow diagram of anaerobic digestion on
    a closed-loop system on farms. The animal wastes normally used in biogas production
    are dung of swine, cattle, goats, poultry, among others. It is also important
    to consider the differences in animal production systems, which can have a relevant
    effect on the amount of dry matter in waste. The organic residues of agriculture
    and livestock are good substrates for co-digestion. Manure comprises a good load
    of micro-organisms, a high amount of nutrients, and favors the buffering capacity
    to control the pH, ensuring the process stability. If human blackwater is mixed
    with animal and agricultural wastes and dissolved in water, it will give off biogas
    as it decomposes in anaerobic conditions under the correct temperature [21]. Animal
    husbandry plays a part in the ecosystem of the farm; hence, for rural sanitation,
    a co-digestion of animal effluent (e.g., fresh cattle manure) and domestic sewage
    are emphasized [22,23]. The design of anaerobic digesters involves a range of
    variables that can be modified to affect biogas yield as desired. Micro-digesters
    in small-scale settings are perhaps more complex, considering that these can also
    be influenced by local contexts and traditional practices [24]. The consequent
    disparity in the design and operations of micro-digesters merits further examination,
    so that developing and sharing the best practices can be possible. Understanding
    traditional practices carried out when adapting AD technology to small-scale farms
    involves understanding how variability in technical factors influences products.
    Additionally, studying the processes required to sustain this technology—the maintenance
    procedures and the management of biogas and digestate within a decentralized,
    small-scale agriculture context—is important [18]. This is especially relevant
    as the scope of AD goes beyond domestic systems to closed-loop, farm-scale installations.
    With AD technology being utilized across the globe in LMICs such as in Asia, Africa
    and Central America, collating strategies used to optimize closed-loop agriculture
    technology in a rural setting is of paramount importance [12]. Thus far, small-scale
    biogas technology in rural contexts in LMICs has been reviewed by Pilloni and
    Hamed [25]. While that research provides an overview of design characteristics,
    materials, and feedstock used across the world, it largely considers household
    settings for digesters. Given that organic agriculture has been lauded to have
    the potential for meaningful sustainable development in LMICs [26], there arises
    a need to review AD technology used across the globe to sustain a closed-loop
    system within farms. Implemented anaerobic digesters in closed-loop, small-scale,
    rural, organic farms have not been reviewed before. With that in mind, this review
    examines implemented decentralized AD systems in rural small farming environments
    in LMICs and reports salient features utilized by them. Using these, it develops
    a set of potential inferences and recommendations on AD technology in such settings
    and provides a direction for future research. 2. Materials and Methods In order
    to draw insights and conclusions on AD technology, it is necessary to document
    the design and management parameters followed in different models around the world.
    Sufficient information may be gleaned from case studies and review articles that
    are likely to outline the processes followed in certain depth. A structured review
    process was conducted to locate such case studies and review articles based on
    closed-loop rural small agriculture technology. The research questions were defined
    as: What are the technologies being used for closed-loop systems in rural farming
    to recover nutrients and energy? What are the system models integrating production
    of gas/energy, clean water and nutrients, and where are they being used? How do
    these models operate and how are they maintained, and consequently, how economically
    efficient are they? Considering these research questions, the following search
    terms were used to look through databases: “closed-loop”, “agriculture”, “rural
    farming”, “organic farming”, “nutrient recovery”, “anaerobic digestion”, “biogas”
    and “micro-digester”. General databases SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, ResearchGate,
    Google Scholar, JSTOR, and subject-specific databases AGRIS, ASCE Library, ICE
    Library and osti.gov were searched to identify relevant literature. Once relevant
    literature was identified, inclusion criteria as outlined below was used to filter
    the case studies to be used for the purpose of the review: Is the system fully
    closed-loop? Does the system studied meet the set research question i.e., is it
    based in a rural, small farm, ideally in LMICs? Does the study include details
    on how the system operates and is maintained? Generally, papers were screened
    by first evaluating titles and keywords only. Further, abstracts were examined
    to ensure relevance and the final set of studies used were fully read through
    and studied. A specific timeframe for review was not defined. Study quality was
    initially assessed by ensuring the use of peer-reviewed literature to guarantee
    validity and reliability of data. This included research articles and conference
    papers, as well as review papers. During the screening process, however, it was
    determined that due to the highly academic and publication-focused nature of the
    review, documentation that, while not peer-reviewed, might still be considered
    reliable, was being neglected. This included project reports and dissertations
    available online with same previously used search terms. The review helped to
    identify the following factors as essential in implementing and maintaining a
    viable AD system: specifications of the model, cost, feedstock and pre-treatment,
    biogas management and digestate management. Data regarding these was extracted,
    analyzed, and discussed to provide evidence from literature, and used to formulate
    recommendations for a closed-loop small-scale agriculture system in LMICs. 3.
    Results 3.1. Technical Aspects of AD Systems The literature review revealed that
    continuous mixing digesters (CFSTR—Continuous Flow Stirred Tank Reactor) are the
    standard technology for AD of denser substrates (total solids of up to 15%), with
    favorable characteristics for pumping and mixing. The CFSTR technology is more
    applied in the agroindustry and in the treatment of sanitary sludge, being used
    less frequently in waste treatment of urban organic products, as the technology
    requires substrates practically free of impurities and sufficiently moist. The
    CFSTR is efficient for agricultural substrates with volumetric loads of 2 to 4
    kg of volatile organic solids per m3 of effective digester volume per day (2–4
    kgVOS/m3.day), and a hydraulic retention time of more than 20 days, producing
    between 0.7 and 3 m3 of biogas per m3 of digester per day, depending on the substrate
    and temperature used [27]. An alternative technology to CFSTR for the farming
    sector is covered anaerobic lagoons (PVC covers for biogas storage), which are
    relatively low cost and easy to build, and are used for the treatment of effluents
    from agriculture, livestock, industry (dairy, meat and others) and sanitary sewage
    treatment. These covered ponds are mostly used in tropical regions, where the
    atmospheric heat can maintain the temperature in the biodigester. The lagoons
    are not able to adequately treat the effluents if they do not have effective coverage,
    releasing methane gas into the atmosphere. The efficiency of AD systems has a
    direct correlation to a range of factors, such as ambient temperature, feedstock,
    feedstocks mixing procedures, retention time, loading rate and system specification
    [28]. Recommendation for pathogenic removal in the AD is the Hydraulic Retention
    Time (HRT), which depends on the temperature in the digester conditions, and,
    considering the ambient temperature range from 20.0 to 35.0 °C, the HRT would
    be at least 20 days [29]. Pathogen removal commences at 1 month, or 30 days, however,
    only some pathogens are removed after this time. The 60 days HRT is recommended
    for highly pathogenic substrates; however, empirical indicators cannot substitute
    analytical testing in a laboratory for Escherichia coli count and helminth egg
    counts [30]. There are advantages of covered lagoon technology, compared to a
    CFSTR bioreactor, such as construction simplicity, operation and maintenance,
    and related reduced costs. In contrast, a larger surface area is required for
    construction in order to meet the low organic volumetric load supported by the
    system, i.e., between 0.25 and 1.00 kg of chemical oxygen demand (COD)/m3.day,
    resulting in a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of three to six days [31,32]. 3.2.
    Identified Case Studies After a review of the findings and other documentation
    that met 75% of the search terms within their title, abstract or keywords (n =
    65), 11 cases were qualified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria described in
    the methodology. A categorization of these cases was carried out and is summarized
    in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of the 11 cases considered for the review. The majority
    of the case studies in Table 1 shortlisted for use in this review formed a small
    part of a comprehensive peer-reviewed publication (such as Smith et al. [33] wherein
    the Debre Zeit study area was the only relevant case for the purpose of this review).
    Such observations confirmed the lack of available literature evaluating rural
    closed-loop technology, reinforcing the need for research in this field. In general,
    each of the case studies could not be said to be of the same quality and worth
    to the review; some of them consisted of more relevant information than others
    and the distinction between peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature was
    often clear. The chosen studies cover a range of LMICs across three different
    continents (Asia, Africa, and Latin America), displaying a distinctly international
    nature of not only the review, but also the water-waste-energy-food model in rural
    agriculture. Figure 2 maps out the locations of the cases studied. Of the 11 studies,
    eight were location-specific. One study focused on a region (Sub-Saharan Africa)
    and two on individual countries (Kenya and Uganda). Figure 2. Locations of the
    11 case studies identified for review. Finally, the data extracted from the case
    studies regarding the previously established parameters can be found in Table
    2. In the case of the reviews used within the analysis, the recommendations made
    in the articles and/or the responses of the majority were used. Table 2. Data
    extracted from case studies for review. 3.3. Insights from Case Studies 3.3.1.
    Specifications of Rural Digesters Each of the documents reviewed (Table 1 and
    Table 2) provides insight regarding the AD digesters used in small-scale rural
    systems. These are either based on the fixed biogas dome or the floating drum
    design, although the tubular flexible balloon model is mentioned as an inexpensive
    alternative. Hojnacki et al. [42] report on biodigesters from gathered data of
    80 different case studies of biodigesters located in five different parts of the
    globe, including China, Brazil, Central America (Costa Rica and Honduras), and
    India. From all 80 case studies reported by the authors, only two contain information
    about small-scale digesters, which are one example from Costa Rica (Santa Fe de
    Guatuso) and one from Brazil (Bahia). They provide a broad understanding of the
    technology of types of biodigesters in terms of size, construction, supply, model,
    and usage (Table 1 and Table 2). Nijaguna [43] points out three main designs for
    the most used rural digesters, which are in decreasing order, the fixed dome,
    the floating cover and the bag-tube type. Gensch [21] shows biogas usage for adapted
    stove and pressure lamps (modified to biogas). Biogas is directly used or stored
    in the dome. Maintenance entails the proper care of water traps, gas burners and
    lamps. The emerging biogas is led through metal or plastic pipes to the point
    of use or collected in the upper part of the biogas digestor (dome) for storage
    purposes (gas holder). From there it is led to the point of use (burner or lamp)
    by pipes. Gas piping is simply either galvanized pipes or plastic pipes with rubber
    hose for final connection to point of use. Biodigesters in floating villages is
    a novel topic, since biodigesters in rural areas have mainly been land-based.
    Small-scale AD using only human waste as input has not been widely evaluated.
    Biodigesters using exclusively human waste will not be enough to produce sufficient
    gas amounts for a household. In these cases, a small-scale biodigester could be
    additionally fed with livestock manure. A high amount of nitrogen (from the breakdown
    of proteins) is in human waste which requires additional carbon input to prevent
    ammonia inhibition in the methanogens. Urea contains ammonia and should be mixed
    with substrates with high C:N ratio such as straw [39]. Buntha et al. [40] present
    a combined flexible-hard digester system. Live and Learn Environmental Education
    Cambodia are working in partnership with the Royal University of Agriculture and
    Engineers Without Borders Australia about integrated food production and sanitation
    for floating communities. They provide development and application of a low-cost
    system, integrating different soft plastic tubular and hard plastic digesters
    connected with a contracted floating drum reservoir, which collect the generated
    biogas. This system can be suitable for tropical rainy areas with a low cost for
    the adapted materials and easily integrated for animal and human wastes. Floating
    biodigesters suitable for water sanitation as well as renewable energy production
    are examples provided by Buntha et al. [40] and Carlsson and Kiste [39]. In these
    cases, the feeds to the biodigester are mainly pig manure and human excrement.
    Therefore, direct pollution to the water is reduced since the waste products are
    used as a resource instead. As a by-product, methane in biogas is available for
    household usages. It mitigates burning wood for cooking which causes health problems
    as well as deforestation. A fixed dome digester, such as the Sinidu model GGC
    2047 [33], consists of a dome atop a fermentation tank, both constructed of concrete
    underground. The gas is stored in the upper part of the digester. Once gas production
    commences, the slurry in the digestion tank overflows into the outlet tank. The
    biogas is available for collection at the top of the fixed dome [44]. Fixed domes
    may also be masonry structures, and ferrocement structures exist as well—specifications
    generally depend on local availability of materials and skilled labour, both of
    which directly influence the cost of the system [45,46]. A major disadvantage
    of this system is its fluctuating gas pressure and the need of highly skilled
    technicians for initial installation. Figure 3a shows a fixed dome digester sketch
    [34]. It should be noted that if fixed dome digesters are used, the materials
    and construction must be of high quality to avoid biogas leakage. Figure 3. Schematics
    of prevalent types of digesters: (a) Fixed dome, a gas-tight chamber constructed
    of bricks, stone or poured concrete (modified from An et al. [52]); (b) Sasse
    floating drum model (modified from Zang et al. [51]) (c) tubular (flexible balloon)
    digester (modified from Zang et al. [51]). A floating drum digester consists of
    a similar underground digester; however, a moving gas-holder (the “floating drum”)
    takes the place of the fixed dome. The gas-holder floats either directly on the
    fermentation slurry or on a water jacket. This system makes it easy to determine
    the volume of the stored gas and provides gas of constant pressure [47]. Construction
    is relatively easy as well, but the costs of the steel drum are generally higher,
    as it is prone to corrosion and has a shorter design life than the fixed dome
    digester [48]. Figure 3b depicts a typical simple floating drum model used in
    rural areas across the world. A flexible balloon (or tubular) digester is considered
    an inexpensive alternative to floating drum and fixed dome digesters [34,49].
    Low-cost tubular digesters generally consist of a sheet of plastic, either low-density
    polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
    They are, hence, flexible, taking the shape of the container they are installed
    in [50]. The feedstock is input into the digester from an inlet at one end, and
    the balloon-like chamber separates the gas from the slurry to be collected from
    the outlets. See the schematic of a tubular digester in Figure 3c [51]. The AD
    biodigester schematics of Figure 3 shows examples of very adaptable units for
    farming families in LMICs. The AD type should take into consideration the number
    of individuals on the family farm (human waste), their animal manure forms, and
    types of agricultural wastes (various residual feedstocks available in the surrounding
    areas) should be taken into consideration. Rowse shows a village-sized fixed dome
    AD digester of 48.4 m3 for 48 households, fed with the manure of two swine-gestating
    sows, six swine-boars, 170 poultry, 20 cattle-beef, two dairy cattle, would generate
    in a fixed dome AD digester 43.5 m3 of biogas per day [53]. If a family farmer
    requires for daily cooking 0.85 m3 biogas, the total of 43.5 m3 of biogas would
    cover 51 farming households [43]. The generated biogas values can be converted
    into specific biogas production rates by dividing the observed biogas values by
    the volatile solids (VS) reduction, which gives the biogas volume of m3 of biogas
    per kg VS reduced or converted by the AD process. Table 3 compares fixed dome,
    floating drum and flexible tubular balloon digesters across a range of parameters
    such as materials, cost, construction times and maintenance requirements. This
    comparison confirms that while flexible balloon (or tubular) digesters are inexpensive
    and much more affordable than the alternative, they may have a less predictable
    design life which may be shortened severely with high exposure to the sun. Table
    3. Characteristic comparison of fixed dome, floating drum and flexible balloon
    digesters. 3.3.2. Costs While system costs depend on the specifications of the
    digester, in some of the cases, a large proportion of the expenses is borne by
    a sponsor rather than the owners themselves. These may be paid back over a previously
    agreed period of time [37,41]. In the case of Buntha et al., they saved costs
    by means of a low-cost system that includes soft and hard plastic biodigesters
    connected to a hard-plastic floating drum reservoir and bamboo to sustain the
    system [40]. A common kitchen in small communities could save costs jointly in
    a small cluster by using biogas distributed from the biogas storage vessel through
    filling truck tire inner tubes or other small plastic reservoirs with biogas.
    Rowse, Buntha et al. and Gensch show some self-adapted systems for saving costs
    such as biogas adapted stoves and lamps [21,40,53]. 3.3.3. Feedstock and Pre-Treatment
    Animal excreta is generally used as feedstock for the biodigester, though human
    excreta may also be mixed for AD co-digestion depending on social acceptability.
    Smith et al. observed that human waste improved the quantity of biogas produced,
    but the proportion of useful digestate reduced [33]. Additionally, Day et al.
    reported that fresh excreta tended to produce more methane than dry excreta [37].
    Hojnacki et al. shows a unique covered AD system for the recovery of energy and
    nutrients from goat manure in Brazil [42]. The cases presented by the Asian Development
    Bank operate the Chinese four-in-one model to collect feedstock, which aims to
    combine the collection of pig and human excreta and channel it into a biodigester,
    from which digestate generated is used within a greenhouse [41]. This approach
    demonstrates a compact, holistic arrangement for small scale farming that can
    be replicated for the incorporation of a greenhouse. Although feedstock does not
    seem to be pre-treated before input, water is stirred in frequently (either by
    hand or using a stick) to form a uniform slurry devoid of large solid particles.
    This water may be obtained using a borehole or through rainwater harvesting. In
    the floating system of Buntha et al., hard and soft plastic biodigesters convert
    in co-digestion mixtures human and animal waste from floating pig farms, and water
    hyacinth plants that grow abundant in Asian lakes into biogas for energy, and
    to treat waste for agriculture or fish feed [40]. Carlsson and Kiste [39] show
    biodigesters in floating areas using similar AD-feedstocks as Buntha et al. [40]
    examples, but they also make remarks about using rice field waste and cow dung
    to provide biogas generation. The idea of a cluster of households for enhancing
    biogas generation through feeding an AD digester system with the community waste
    of animals is interesting. For example, to save costs and to share operations
    and maintenance (O and M), 3.0 m3 biodigesters (polyethylene tubular or floating
    drum) were designed for animal waste from six households in India. These digesters
    were fed with manure of two swine, 25 poultry and one cattle-beef and generated
    daily 2.7 m3 biogas, which corresponds to half of the energy needs of six family
    households [53]. Schoeber et al. recommends forage legumes, shrubs, and hybrid
    grasses be added to feedstock to raise its quality. Furthermore, it suggests that
    use of organic material such as vegetable residue and other types of manure might
    increase bio-slurry production [35]. However, most cases studied argue that input
    of human excreta in the digester improves biogas production as opposed to the
    input of animal excreta or organic waste. Thus, this is contradictory to Venugopalan
    et al. who observed that the difference between the yield with human excreta,
    food waste and organic wastes was not significant [54]. A strong inference hence
    cannot be drawn regarding feedstock. Regarding the required ratio by which to
    measure manure and water inputs, Marti-Herrero et al. [55] has studied it to be
    1:1 manure: water for fixed dome digesters and 1:3 for tubular digesters. 3.3.4.
    Biogas Management Generally, biogas was sent via pipeline to farmers’ households
    in order to be used for cooking and lighting within them. In two cases, the biogas
    was also applied for heating either the households or the greenhouse that supplemented
    the farm. Gensch [21] gives attention to biogas-adapted stoves and lamps, and
    the biogas is also captured by pipes. Orskov et al. suggested that the biogas
    generated (or at least part of it) could be used to maintain the required ambient
    temperature for the biodigester [36]. Yield was indicated to be variable. In the
    system of Buntha et al. [40], floating hard-plastic reservoirs retain the biogas
    in wet areas. 3.3.5. Digestate Management The case studies reviewed (Table 1 and
    Table 2) suggest that no solid/liquid separation is carried out on the digestate;
    that is, the digestate remaining after the AD process is used to fertilize plants
    after dilution. In some cases, it is composted with dry organic waste to be used
    as bio-fertilizer for farming later. Biogas for energy and to treat waste for
    agriculture and fish feed is presented by Buntha et al. [40]. 3.4. Recommendations
    Adaptations in design for flexible digesters may offer options to protect plastic
    or rubber materials from the sunlight, e.g., in the case of land, burying it halfway
    into the ground, and in the case of floating areas, covering the digesters with
    bamboo or wood materials. As AD is a temperature-dependent process, the variance
    of the ambient temperature can cause large fluctuations in the productivity and
    efficiency of the digester [56]. This introduces the need for temperature control.
    From this perspective, the fixed dome design may be optimal for a farm-scale biodigester
    in a location where climate poses a problem. Alternatively, greenhouse canopies
    may be used to maintain the required ambient temperature as suggested in Orskov
    et al. [36]. Co-digestion of animal manures with industrial organic wastes or
    energy crops has been studied to enhance farm-scale biogas production [57]. Waste
    like agricultural straw, however, must be pre-treated prior to digestion [58].
    Composting pre-treatment is an environmentally friendly method of improving AD
    productivity and, therefore, co-digestion with it could be the ideal way of optimizing
    a small farm-scale AD system in LMICs. The cases analyzed within this review indicate
    that most, if not all, of the biogas produced in the AD process is used for household
    purposes such as cooking, lighting and heating. It has also been suggested that
    some of the biogas be used to generate heat for the biodigester if needed [36].
    However, it is possible to use the gas for farm purposes such as motor fuel or
    in a generator [59]. In addition, biogas upgrading, and bottling has been reported
    to be a viable alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG) in vehicles through
    the use of gas kits [60]. If biogas can be used for both on-farm vehicles and
    electricity generation successfully, such a system could reinforce the closed-loop
    in small-scale farms and create a more sustainable local economy. This method
    has been implemented successfully in Indiana, USA, reducing diesel costs and creating
    a revenue stream for excess electricity. However, the 35,000-cow dairy farm in
    this case had government support of over USD 12 million and the benefit of scale,
    thus may not be directly transferrable for the case of small LMIC farms [61].
    Although the cases reviewed (Table 2 and Table 3) note direct usage of digestate
    on crops as fertilizer, the health and sanitation aspects of such a practice can
    be called into question, especially with regards to digestate from human waste
    [62]. Rain events may also lead to digestate directly applied to land losing its
    nutrient content and polluting local water bodies. As such, bio-slurry may be
    dried in the sun; however, this may result in almost total loss of inorganic nitrogen
    [63]. Therefore, it can be recommended that instead of direct application, bio-slurry
    be composted prior to use as fertilizer [64]. This reduces, if not eliminates,
    the health and safety risk posed by pathogens in liquid bio-slurry, while retaining
    its nutrient content [65,66]. Another alternative to direct application is the
    use of a struvite (MgNH4PO4) precipitation reactor for nitrogen and phosphorous
    recovery. A pilot-scale demonstration of creating this struvite fertilizer as
    a part of a small-scale AD system was conducted in Costa Rica with promising results
    [67]. The reactor was relatively low-cost (USD 660) and made using locally available
    virgin and second-life materials. Many closed-loop pilots have utilized wastewater
    treatment practices such as the use of constructed wetlands (CW) to separate the
    liquid fraction of the digestate for utility in the AD system [62]. However, a
    constructed form can be expensive for small-scale systems of rural farms. Alternatives
    for treating AD digestate could be aquatic plants and macrophytes filtering gardens
    [68]. For example, a study from Indonesia using Canna indica, Iris pseudacorus,
    and Typha latifolia to uptake nutrients from digestate found that highest N uptake
    and biomass increment were carried out by Canna indica (25.1% and 80.5%, respectively)
    [69]. In addition, effluent N removal was also achieved by Canna indica (68.5–76.4%
    total nitrogen-TN), Iris pseudacorus (61.8–71.3% TN), and Typha latifolia (61.6–74.5%
    TN). 3.5. Analysis of the Review Methodology This study reviewed literature and
    compared case studies regarding closed-loop AD technologies for rural communities,
    utilizing databases and search engines for this purpose. The geographical locations,
    system designs, operation and maintenance procedures, and economic implications
    were extracted, compared, and discussed. While efforts were taken to ensure thoroughness
    and exhaustiveness of the review, it is possible for sources to have been overlooked.
    For example, though the databases searched were international, they may not have
    contained articles from regional journals published in LMICs, or articles chosen
    may have been a target to publication biases. The inclusion of literatures such
    as a dissertation, a master thesis [38], and a project report [41] created a larger
    pool to extract valuable pictures and data from, rather than the use of only journal
    articles. This can alternatively be said to have diluted the quality of the review
    slightly; however, the scale of this cannot be exactly pinpointed. Regardless,
    the use of predominantly peer-reviewed literature has maintained a good standard
    of quality of the review. Conversely, the use of largely peer-reviewed literature
    can be observed to have adversely impacted the range of cases studied. It is possible
    that upon inclusion of perhaps less reliable data, more elaborate and thorough
    case studies may have been located. As it stands, not only is the data reviewed
    too limited to draw strong conclusions from, but it is also rather varied in scope.
    For example, studies touching upon data generalized across an abstract area such
    as Sub-Saharan Africa [36] can arguably not be used in conjunction with an article
    concerning only a specific district in Vietnam [34]. In addition, in some cases
    the data has been extracted from isolated cases [33] which may not be wholly representative
    of actual conditions. Due to the small sample size, inferences thus drawn may
    not be accurate. Finally, some studies used [34,37] and the information therein
    may no longer be considered relevant due to their age. Overall, while this review
    encompasses technology located in a number of LMICs (e.g., Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia,
    China, Cambodia, Brazil, Costa Rica) and covers a variety of arguments regarding
    farm-scale biodigester technology from different viewpoints, it points to a clear
    lack of research, data, and reporting in this field. It is evident that while
    progress is being made in LMICs to adapt closed-loop of water–waste–energy–food
    (WWEF) systems to the local climate, economy and sociocultural environment, the
    documentation to support this is largely absent. 3.6. Future Research Opportunities
    There is a clear lack of published research and case studies that document small-scale
    closed-loop systems, as highlighted earlier. Given the benefits of anaerobic digestion
    on smallholder farms, there will be a need to validate the specification recommendations
    highlighted in this paper. Therefore, further research that investigates this
    topic in different geographies and evaluates the effectiveness of recommendations
    provided will be beneficial. Settings that are not small-scale rural farms but
    may be close comparisons to make, such as urban community farms and markets, could
    also be considered, with contextual differences accounted for. Furthermore, in
    the future, there could be consideration given to technological advancements in
    the past few years, leading to the classification of existing literature by the
    publication period; innovations in low-cost materials can be accounted for here.
    Including sociocultural parameters such as local ownership and indigenous practices
    might also be an integral area of work. Gaps in local knowledge for implementing
    AD systems must be studied in order to develop better educational material and
    more effective participatory programs for small-scale farms. Simultaneously, it
    will be important to look at long-term financial sustainability and impact of
    small-scale farm AD systems, with or without incentives from governments. On environmental
    sustainability, given the potency of methane as a greenhouse gas (GHG), the GHG
    abatement potential of small-scale farm AD systems can also be studied. Indirect
    abatement of carbon dioxide emissions through the use of biogas and avoidance
    of synthetic fertilizer can form a part of this research. 4. Conclusions This
    structured review aimed to assess and recommend closed-loop technologies for small-scale
    waste–water–energy–food systems focusing in small-scale farms in LMICs. The review
    shows that presently, the published literature in the AD sector focuses on household
    systems rather than on-farm closed-loop technology. The anaerobic digesters used
    in small-scale rural systems are mostly based on the fixed biogas dome or the
    floating drum design, but the tubular flexible balloon model is mentioned as a
    low-cost alternative. Interestingly, in some of the cases reviewed, a large proportion
    of the design and construction expense is borne by a sponsor, with the owners
    themselves only bearing operational expenses. In addition, while progress is being
    made in LMICs to adapt closed-loop WWEF systems to the local climate, economy,
    and sociocultural environment, the review revealed that the documentation to support
    this is largely absent. This makes disseminating learnings from implemented projects
    even more important. While case studies sourced from across the LMICs provide
    a direction to how closed-loop AD-WWEF systems may be implemented in these farm-scale
    contexts, literature also suggests gaps at the macro-level. This includes incentives,
    skill-building, and the need for community buy-in to prime WWEF systems for success.
    Overall, there is an opportunity to test the technical parameters recommended
    in this review in the future. At the same time, researching and understanding
    financial sustainability and sociocultural parameters will also play an important
    role in closing the loop in organic farms and improving rural livelihoods. Funding

    improve water efficiency and crop yields, but there are also challenges associated
    with implementing these systems, such as data quality, scalability, and security.
  limitations: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the economic viability
    of closed-loop irrigation management systems, which could be a valuable addition
    for farmers and other stakeholders considering implementing these systems.
  main_objective: To evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time,
    closed-loop irrigation management systems, with a focus on addressing the global
    food challenge and utilizing technologies such as IoT and machine learning.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in the outline,
    as it discusses the use of closed-loop, autonomous irrigation systems in research
    and commercial settings. It provides concrete examples of how these systems have
    been implemented and the benefits they have achieved, including increased water
    efficiency and crop yields. The paper also discusses the challenges associated
    with implementing these systems, such as data quality, scalability, and security,
    and proposes solutions to address these challenges. Overall, this paper provides
    a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the state-of-the-art in closed-loop

  description: Future food production will need to deliver a healthy diet to a growing
    world population whilst also contributing to policy objectives such as achieving
    Net Zero emissions and addressing biodiversity loss. This article looks at circular
    economy solutions to this challenge, comparing McArthur Foundation and other approaches
    to both the circular material economy (e.g. focusing on steel, plastics, aluminium,
    and cement) and the circular bioeconomy (operating in sectors that include agriculture,
    food production and industrial biotechnology). A case study based on salmon farming
    in Scotland considers the roles of innovation from a range of technology sectors
    in contributing to these objectives. The concept of circularity, and the closed-loop
    thinking that it encourages, could attract attention towards less optimal production
    options just because they can be accommodated within a circular model. A ‘networked
    bioeconomy’ model, guided by cascading principles and fast-tracked using innovative
    technologies, may be more powerful than one based on rigid closed-loop circularity,
    in enabling policy makers and producers to understand how they can best contribute
    both to the conservation of biodiversity and to mitigating climate change.

  explanation: The article focuses on the role of closed-loop, autonomous irrigation
    systems in meeting the growing demand for food production while addressing global
    challenges such as water scarcity and climate change. It emphasizes the need to
    integrate these systems with existing infrastructure, highlighting technologies
    and benefits achieved through case studies.

    whilst also contributing to policy objectives such as achieving Net Zero emissions
    and addressing biodiversity loss. This article looks at circular economy solutions
    to this challenge, comparing McArthur Foundation and other approaches to both
    the circular material economy (e.g. focusing on steel, plastics, aluminium, and
    cement) and the circular bioeconomy (operating in sectors that include agriculture,
    food production and industrial biotechnology). A case study based on salmon farming
    in Scotland considers the roles of innovation from a range of technology sectors
    in contributing to these objectives. The concept of circularity, and the closed-loop
    thinking that it encourages, could attract attention towards less optimal production
    options just because they can be accommodated within a circular model. A ‘networked
    bioeconomy’ model, guided by cascading principles and fast-tracked using innovative
    technologies, may be more powerful than one based on rigid closed-loop circularity,
    in enabling policy makers and producers to understand how they can best contribute
    both to the conservation of biodiversity and to mitigating climate change. Similar

    on the Current State and Future Opportunities Chapter © 2023 Circular Bioeconomy:
    A Path to Sustainable and Climate-Wise (Material) Economy? Chapter © 2021 Background  Globally,
    food production accounts for 26% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, distributed
    across land use (24%), crop production (27%), livestock and fisheries (31%), and
    the supply chain (18%) [1]. A report from the UK Department for Environment Food
    and Rural Affairs estimates that in the UK, GHG emissions from agriculture for
    2019 were 46.3 Mt CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents), down from 53.1 Mt CO2e in
    1990, making up 10% of the UK’s total GHG emissions and 47% of total methane emissions
    [2], mainly from ruminant animal production. An important thrust of UK climate
    change policies [3] is promoting changes in the protein component of human diets
    from red meat to sources with lower associated GHG emissions, such as fish and
    chicken, as well as encouraging vegetarian and vegan options. This is also a feature
    of EU food policies for health and the environment, along with legislative reform,
    and funding of circular opportunities in the wider bioeconomy [4, 5]. Under the
    UK scenario, by 2050, UK agriculture is expected to account for 25% of the remaining
    GHG emissions [6]. This high proportion attributed to agriculture is due to the
    more radical reductions in emissions expected from other sectors of the economy,
    such as heating and transport. However, beyond these changes in consumer dietary
    behaviour, innovative technologies that are currently being developed could play
    a major role in further reducing food production’s contributions to climate change,
    particularly if they are part of an integrated value chain approach. Future food
    production will need to meet national and international biodiversity and climate
    change policy objectives, such as Net Zero [7] and the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals [8]. Circular economy solutions, enabled by innovation from various technology
    sectors, and regulatory adaptation [9], will be needed to support these transitions
    in the UK and the EU [10,11,12,13], and are increasingly regarded as intrinsic
    elements in the overall sustainability picture [14, 15]. Understanding the mismatches
    and potential synergies between the circular material economy [16] (focusing,
    for example, on steel, plastics, aluminium, and cement) and the circular bioeconomy
    [17] (operating in sectors that include agriculture, food production and industrial
    biotechnology) will help to identify new opportunities to optimise circularity
    in food production systems. Here we explore how circular economy principles can
    be applied to fish farming and argue that rather than an over-rigid emphasis on
    closed-loop circularity, establishing a network of value chains, covering both
    the material and the bioeconomy, may be more effective in achieving Net Zero policy
    goals. We also make the case that, from a sustainable development point of view,
    it is important to ensure that policy and technology initiatives designed to meet
    Net Zero targets do not have negative impacts on biodiversity and vice versa.
    The focus should be on initiatives that contribute positively to both Net Zero
    and biodiversity protection. Circularity in the Bioeconomy and the Material Economy
    Tan and Lamers [18] discuss two categories of circular economy definition: those
    based on the MacArthur Foundation models and ‘the rest’, emphasising the dominance
    of the MacArthur Foundation in circular economy thinking. Across the board, the
    circular economy is described as moving from a ‘take, make, dispose’ linear economy
    to one that puts an emphasis on making things last, keeping products in high-value
    use for as long as possible, reusing and repairing products, and recycling materials
    back into the value chain at the end of the product’s life [19, 20]. These criteria
    work well as a foundation for conceptualising and implementing a circular material
    economy but they can prove problematic in a bioeconomy context for sectors such
    as food production. Business Models and Value Chains The MacArthur Foundation
    models envisage a common value chain for both material- and bio-based circular
    economies (Fig. 1) [19], from parts manufacture, to product manufacture, to service
    provision. While this may be a sufficiently accurate representation of a material
    economy, it is not a good description of most bioeconomy value chains. For example,
    food production may go through several stages, involving different company business
    models and transformations of the bio-material, rather than consciously manufacturing
    separate parts that are then assembled to make a product. Also, in the context
    of Net Zero and climate change, the bioeconomy focuses on carbon itself as an
    intrinsic component of products, considering the replacement of fossil fuels in
    production processes, using low-carbon energy inputs, sustainable supply chains,
    and new technologies that transform bio-resources to higher value bio-based products
    [18]. Capture and release of carbon as an integral component of the product, during
    intermediate stages of production and the final consumption process, require a
    more ‘open’ approach to the design of a circular bioeconomy than for a material
    economy. The intrinsic biodegradability and renewability of biological materials
    add a further layer of complexity and create a different range of opportunities
    for circular bioeconomy design. Fig. 1 Butterfly Diagram. Source: Ellen MacArthur

    models do distinguish between the material and the bioeconomy in the fate of the
    end products (Fig. 1) [19]. Material goods are generally not consumed in use,
    so maintaining their life for as long as possible is a valid objective and recycling
    materials at the end of life is a viable option. For food production, consumption
    is the expected fate of the product and sustainability would be best served by
    minimising the amount of bio-material that is not consumed in use (i.e. food waste),
    hence minimising the amount of material available for re-use or recycling at the
    end of the value chain. (This article does not tackle the very important, but
    also very difficult, question of the use of human sewage.) Closed Loops and Cascades
    Closed loops are a key element of the MacArthur approach with recommendations
    to “… keep components and materials in closed loops and prioritise inner loops”
    (Fig. 1) [19]. The international standard ISO 14044 [21] describes closed loops
    as the recovery and recycling of materials for their original purpose without
    change to their inherent properties, as epitomised in a material circular economy;
    in open loops, the recovered materials have different inherent properties and
    are used for purposes other than the original, as is more likely to be the case
    in a bioeconomy. However, even in the material economy, there are sometimes good
    reasons to favour open-loop recycling [22]. The related cascading principle also
    implies the use and re-use of by-products that are produced at various stages
    of a product’s development and proposes criteria for choosing among different
    recycling opportunities. Material that is not incorporated within the commercial
    end-product should be captured at each stage in the value chain and diverted into
    a cascade of consecutive processes, maintaining it in higher-value states, from
    the point of view of carbon sequestration, for as long as possible. In a circular
    bioeconomy, from a Net Zero perspective, conversion of carbon-containing by-products,
    such as carbon dioxide, into semi-permanent products such as bio-plastics [22]
    or building materials [23], removing the by-products, long term, from the circular
    economy value chain, would be the highest value use. Options such as recycling
    into food production systems would be of intermediate value and fuel use or waste
    disposal would be the least desirable option [24]. Campbell-Johnston et al. [25]
    have noted that little research has been done on how to operationalise the cascading
    principle and integrate it with other circular economy principles and yet, as
    we claim here, it may be more important for cutting GHG emissions in the bioeconomy
    than the principle of circularity itself. The Role of Innovative Technologies
    The MacArthur Foundation report on a circular economy vision for Europe acknowledges
    the importance of technological innovation in delivering a circular material economy,
    with a 7% increase in impact above current projections in gross domestic product
    (GDP) by 2030 and 12% by 2050. It states, “The key reason for the difference is
    that this report assumes a substantially higher pace of technology change in the
    big product and resource sectors … compared to what has been observed in the past
    …” [19]. However, the role of genetic technologies in European agriculture and
    food production has been controversial, and the MacArthur Foundation report on
    circularity in European food systems does not mention a role for technological
    innovation, proposing only socioeconomic solutions—regenerative farming practices,
    changing diets towards alternative, vegetarian and vegan protein sources, and
    reducing food waste [26]. There has been a pervasive anti-technology discourse
    on sustainable farming systems in Europe over the past 30 years [27, 28], with
    few added insights or prescriptions arising from circular economy thinking and
    other technology and policy developments, reinforced in the EU Farm to Fork Strategy
    [29]. This anti-technology, particularly anti-biotechnology, perspective on food
    production systems could prevent the EU from meeting the nutritional needs of
    its population while also delivering on Net Zero and biodiversity objectives,
    particularly when one considers the adverse effects on biodiversity and GHG emissions
    resulting from producing food for import into the EU to make up for shortfalls
    in EU food production [30, 31]. Achieving these outcomes in the necessary timescale
    will require a creative and discriminating approach to technological innovation
    (including biotechnologies, robotics, big data, and artificial intelligence),
    along with new business models and value chains, a more nuanced understanding
    of the nature of circularity in food production and different supporting policies
    and regulations [32], compared to the status quo and to a material-based circular
    economy. The following case study on fish farming in Scotland [33] was undertaken
    to explore how best to apply circular economy insights to food-related bioeconomy
    value chains. Putting a Circular Food Bioeconomy into Practice in Aquaculture:
    Case Study on Salmon Farming in Scotland The ideas and concepts discussed in this
    paper were partly stimulated by a research case study on Scottish aquaculture
    and its contribution to Net Zero and biodiversity policies [33]. This provided
    an opportunity to explore some of our evolving thinking on circular economy concepts
    and their implementation. Global increases in fish consumption, partly caused
    by the growing global population, and climate change policies encouraging changes
    in diets, are expected to lead to significant increases in the demand for fish
    protein. However, most wild fish stocks are either over-fished (approx. 30%) or
    fished at their maximum sustainable yield (60%) [34]. Thus, although many forms
    of capture fishery production have been shown to be low in GHG emissions, and
    sometimes are lower than aquaculture production, the required increase in production
    will need to come from farmed species [35]. The Scottish aquaculture sector has
    ambitious plans to double the economic value of production by 2030 [36]. It is
    currently the third largest salmon producer in the world after Norway and Chile
    and salmon is the UK’s third largest food export by value [37]. The sector is
    already becoming more sustainable by reducing its impact on marine biodiversity
    and contributing to Net Zero climate change policies [33, 36], and this case study
    explored how technology options could improve its future performance in these
    areas. However, some options that could lower GHG emissions could have damaging
    impacts on marine or land biodiversity and our analysis took these factors into
    account. A detailed description of the technologies, their stage of development
    and uptake, and their potential future impact is included in the aquaculture case
    study report [33]. The value chain relationships that emerged in this case study
    (Fig. 2) are more complex than those implied in the McArthur models, indicating
    the need for linked, not necessarily circular, value chains and company business
    models involving inputs and outputs that cannot be envisaged as part of a circular
    aquaculture bioeconomy. In this figure, the central circular economy value chain
    encapsulates elements that could be incorporated within a McArthur-style circular
    bioeconomy. As described below, there are also inputs (bottom left corner) and
    outputs (top right corner) that involve other value chains beyond aquaculture
    and businesses engaged in wider networked economies. In some cases, these will
    be potentially circular economies in sectors other than aquaculture. In other
    cases, they will be ‘open loop’ opportunities, delivering significant benefits
    for important health and environment-related policies, but not necessarily aspiring
    to deliver circularity. Fig. 2 The circular economy value network and the role
    of innovative technologies for Scottish salmon farming Full size image Technology
    Options The following innovative technologies contribute, at various points along
    the production value chain, to achieving the aims of government policies on Net
    Zero, the circular bioeconomy, zero waste, and protecting marine biodiversity.
    Novel Animal Feed Sources Fish feed, required for salmon production, can account
    for over 90% of fish-to-farm-gate GHG emissions [38] and is the most expensive
    component of aquaculture production. Previous reliance on fishmeal and omega-3
    oils from wild capture fisheries has placed significant pressure on wild fish
    populations with impacts on marine biodiversity. Among other factors such as concern
    over security of supply, this has resulted in a shift to greater reliance on plant-based
    ingredients, most commonly soya meal that now comprises around 50% of feed [38].
    This has reduced the pressure on marine ecosystems, but it has increased GHG emissions
    and shifted some of the biodiversity impact to land ecosystems such as the Amazon
    rainforest and the Cerrado savannah in Brazil [39]. Potentially more sustainable
    feed options are now being developed using single-celled protein from micro-organisms
    and black soldier fly or yellow mealworm larvae, developed using by-products from
    unrelated industry sectors, including inputs such as methane, carbon dioxide,
    hydrogen, and non-domestic food waste. These future feed ingredients could be
    produced closer to the point of use than current soya products, saving on transport
    costs and emissions, and making supply chains shorter and more reliable. New Production
    Systems (Innovative Facilities) There are new, material economy rather than bio-based,
    systems that are designed to increase production capacity, reduce environmental
    impacts, meet planning-related challenges, and increase overall control of aquaculture
    production systems [33]. They include the following: Off-shore high energy systems,
    defined as production in exposed sites usually more than 2 km from shore [40],
    have benefits to fish health, reduced environmental impact from waste, and greater
    efficiency from larger scale production. They also have technical, staff risk-related
    and energy-use problems that are still to be resolved. Depending on the source
    of power used to support them, GHG emissions from off-shore systems can be higher
    than those from conventional production systems closer in-shore. Closed containment
    systems located in sheltered in-shore or off-shore waters are mainly used as nurseries
    or for on-growing salmon smolts so that they can be transferred to a marine environment
    at a larger size. They can reduce energy consumption by 75%, increase the feed
    conversion ratio and reduce fish mortalities. Recirculating aquaculture systems
    on land, mainly used as hatcheries and nurseries, have been in use for many years,
    but improvements in production capacity, energy systems, waste recovery, and water
    cleaning will contribute to meeting climate change and biodiversity targets. Food
    Processing and Waste Utilisation Waste elimination and by-product utilisation
    at the food processing stage of salmon food production are core elements of a
    circular economy approach. By-products are already incorporated into co-products
    in related sectors, or recycled within a salmon farming circular economy; for
    example, using viscera to make fishmeal and fish oil, fish heads to make salmon
    oil, and trimmings for domestic food use. Relevant to a material circular economy,
    re-usable bulk bins for domestic supply chains, replacing polystyrene boxes, have
    led to an estimated saving so far of 4.1 Kt CO2-e [41], with potential to increase
    if the innovation is taken up by more companies. Development of biodegradable
    packaging based on chitin, a by-product from crustacean production, is being supported
    by the UK supermarket Waitrose. Where the production system allows capture of
    un-eaten feed and faeces, a major focus of concern for the Scottish Government,
    they can be used as biofuel or fertiliser. Fish blood is also used for these purposes.
    Where mortality occurs, dead fish are being processed in one location by anaerobic
    digestion to produce biofuel to replace diesel oil for fishery service vehicles.
    However, innovative technologies can also reduce fish mortality, reducing the
    viability of this kind of recycling option (see below). Fish processing by-products
    can be used for terrestrial livestock feed, pet food and pharmaceuticals, further
    reducing their reliance on fishmeal and fish oil from wild capture fisheries.
    Animal Breeding, Health and Welfare Fish health and welfare issues are seen as
    a top priority by the aquaculture sector [42] and many innovations are already
    well established across the industry. New innovations under development include
    vaccines against pathogens and treatments for sea lice infestations (thermal treatments,
    mechanical removal, biological control using ‘cleaner fish’, and under-water lasers).
    The new production systems discussed above could also deliver benefits in sea
    lice control, as could breeding for sea lice resistance in salmon [43]. Conclusions
    from the Aquaculture Case Study This case study was undertaken partly to test
    our emerging critique of circular economy concepts as they are applied to food-related
    bioeconomies, drawing on, but not necessarily dominated by, circular economy thinking.
    The main conclusion was the need for policies to speed up development of innovative
    sources of aqua-feed with the potential to improve both biodiversity and climate
    change-related impacts of fish farming [44]. Current feed products will be based
    for some time on a combination of wild-caught fish and soya meal with both climate
    change and biodiversity impacts and there is a need to speed up production of
    alternative, more sustainable feed sources. This case study also noted that future
    expansion in protein production from marine sources could be even more sustainable
    if it focused on lower-trophic fish and filter feeders, rather than carnivores
    [33]. We observed that a more complex networked, rather than circular, bioeconomy
    approach would be a better foundation for future strategic planning and policy
    making, optimising the opportunities for resource conservation and re-use across
    a broad range of value chains, rather than focusing primarily on closed-loop circularity.
    As illustrated in Fig. 2, the core fish farming, protein production value chain
    is becoming part of a circular economy, both bio and material, based on innovative
    technologies, that could contribute to and benefit from links with other value
    chains, creating what could more accurately be called a ‘networked economy’ rather
    than a circular economy. This analysis is based on a methodological approach to
    which the authors have contributed [45] that builds on systemic analysis of innovation
    processes in companies and the ecosystem factors that influence translation of
    products to market readiness. We are proposing that these considerations are a
    useful addition to the already extensive body of literature on circular economy
    analysis [e.g. 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 46]. Re-thinking Our Approach to Circularity:
    a Network of Open- and Closed-Loop Opportunities The Innogen Institute’s approach
    to innovation management includes optimising company interactions along the entire
    value chain in addition to considering individual company business models, and
    analysing the impacts on product development of the innovation ecosystem (intellectual
    property, regulation/governance systems, and stakeholder perspectives and interactions)
    [45]. As demonstrated in the case study, this approach is proving useful in evaluating
    the role of circular economy thinking in delivering innovations that are economically
    viable, contribute to climate change mitigation, and are beneficial to health
    and the environment. In a protein production circular economy where the food end-product
    will largely be consumed, some of the criteria applied to evaluation of a circular
    material economy are not relevant. However, as shown in Fig. 2, there are opportunities
    at several points in this circular bioeconomy to reintroduce by-products into
    the core value chain, to smolt and adult fish production, and to harvesting and
    processing. This MacArthur-style closed-loop circular bioeconomy model uses cascading
    to maintain by-products in an intermediate-value state, mainly other food uses
    (animal feed or fertiliser), with some low-value biofuel use. Figure 2 also demonstrates
    opportunities beyond the closed-loop system, in a wider network of open-loop bio-
    or material economies, where these by-products could contribute to other food
    and non-food value chains, potentially cascading to higher-value uses not available
    in a strictly circular bioeconomy; for example fish scales and skin can be made
    into alternatives to leather [46]. The key message is that recycling opportunities
    within a closed-loop circular bioeconomy may be inferior to those in wider, networked,
    open-loop systems. The optimal cascading opportunities in food production systems
    may come from cascading some co-products to higher value uses in the emerging
    bio-material economy (manufacturing bioplastics [22] or building materials [23])
    rather than retaining them in a more circular model within the food and feed bioeconomy.
    As in fish farming, advances in innovative technologies will play an essential
    role across the bioeconomy in safe-guarding food security and quality, while also
    reducing GHG emissions and promoting the use of by-products. Innovative biotechnologies,
    such as genome editing and synthetic biology, are likely to be among the most
    powerful contributors to circular bioeconomy objectives and we should avoid making
    invalid assumptions about the incompatibility of such products with sustainable
    development objectives or simply defining products of these technologies as unsustainable.
    The circular economy and the associated concepts of closed-loop and open-loop
    recycling along with the cascading principle are making invaluable contributions
    to the vital, climate change-driven transformation of material economies and bioeconomies.
    Also, the concept of a circular economy is increasingly gaining traction among
    companies, policy makers, and governments, and insights and analyses such as those
    presented here could be counter-productive if they undermined decision makers’
    confidence in circular economy models. We are making the case that an optimal
    approach to delivering Net Zero and biodiversity commitments may best be achieved
    by a circular economy approach that extends to a wider, networked system of value
    chains within which there are many, connected, open loop, recycling opportunities
    (Fig. 2). As Stegman et al. [17] point out, a circular bioeconomy is not inherently
    sustainable and there is a need to address potential trade-offs, by facilitating
    cooperation across value chains and optimising cascading pathways. Given the complexity
    of interactions across this wider landscape of value chains, such an approach
    would help guide policy interventions and research support to areas where there
    is clear, preferably quantitative, evidence for expected improvements in GHG emissions.
    The approach should focus on the options with the biggest potential gains and
    those where synergy among recycling initiatives could maximise positive outcomes.
    Particularly in the food bioeconomy, strictly closed-loop thinking may divert
    attention away from superior options just because they cannot be accommodated
    within a narrow circular model. A more widely networked circular bioeconomy, guided
    by cascading principles, may be a more powerful model in enabling policy makers
    and producers to understand the actual and potential shape of the whole production
    system within which they are located, and how they can best contribute to both
    conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. References   Ritchie, H.

  description: 'The poultry broiler industry utilizes vast broiler shed buildings
    to house large numbers of young chicks that are bred for their meat. These buildings
    require precise thermal regulation to optimize the growth and health of the chicks
    during the early stages of development, and hence they have substantial heating
    and cooling energy demands. In 2018 in the U.S. alone there were more than 9 billion
    broiler chickens produced, across approximately 25,000 family farms (National
    Chicken Council, 2021). New Zealand has a major agriculture industry and in 2022
    approximately 19.25 million chickens were raised for meat production. The interest
    in using geothermal energy for various agricultural applications involving heating
    and cooling is growing globally. Direct utilization of geothermal energy increased
    by over 50% between 2015 and 2020 (Lund and Toth, 2021). New Zealand has a strong
    history of utilizing high temperature resources for power generation, however
    there is a huge opportunity to develop some of its lower temperature resources
    for direct-use projects which the agricultural sector could benefit from. This
    paper summarizes a options appraisal case study evaluating direct use geothermal
    systems for supplying the heat demand of two chicken broiler sheds. The project
    is located in Central Waikato, New Zealand at a site known as the Mangakino Farm.
    The location is within the Mangakino Geothermal System, which has been estimated
    to have a total stored heat potential of between 887 PJ - 2229 PJ and can be applied
    to domestic, industrial, and commercial direct heat applications. The preliminary
    baseload heat demand of the broiler sheds used to house and raise chickens for
    consumption has been estimated at 2800 kW relative to the peak load of 4,000 kW.
    Based on the geothermal potential and the heat demand, nine different configurations
    for geothermal systems have been analyzed. The analysis considers multiple options
    including: utilization of existing geothermal wells in the study area, new drilling
    for open and closed loop systems, and the use of ground source heat pumps. Financial
    and risk analyses were undertaken for each of the options to deliver recommendations
    on those that should be considered for a more detailed pre-feasibility study.
    This paper presents the results obtained for each option including expected outputs,
    benefits, challenges and construction costs. It then discusses the findings before
    presenting recommendations and conclusions for further works.'

  explanation: The paper presents the Live-in-Labs™ program, which aims to address
    challenges faced by rural communities and develop sustainable technology-based
    solutions. The program emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, experiential
    learning, and phased implementation of interventions. The paper also proposes
    the Rapid Translational Research and Implementation (RTRI) model, which guides
    the development and implementation of these interventions.

  main_objective: To present the Live-in-Labs™ program, which aims to address challenges
    faced by rural communities and develop sustainable technology-based solutions.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is relevant to the specific point of economic and
    practical considerations for transitioning from manual to automated irrigation
    management because it provides insights into the challenges and strategies for
    integrating automated irrigation systems with existing irrigation infrastructure.
    The paper discusses the need for considering economic and social factors when
    implementing new technologies in rural communities, and it emphasizes the importance
    of involving local communities in the design and implementation process. Overall,
    the paper provides valuable information for the literature review on automated
    irrigation management systems.

- explanation: "First, we carefully selected the criteria used for evaluation to ensure\
    \ their relevance to the specific problem of evaluating water management strategies\
    \ for smart cities. However, it is important to acknowledge that there may be\
    \ other relevant criteria that were not included in this study. As new developments\
    \ occur in the field of smart city water management, future research could explore\
    \ additional criteria that may impact the effectiveness of strategies. Second,\
    \ the determination of criteria weights using the MCDM-AHP method relies on objective\
    \ judgments, and the results may vary based on the perspectives of different stakeholders.\
    \ To address this, future research could consider using additional methods, such\
    \ as sensitivity analysis, to explore how the results change under different weighting\
    \ schemes. \n\nThird, while the study provides general insights into the evaluation\
    \ of water management strategies in smart cities, it is essential to consider\
    \ the unique contexts and challenges of specific cities. Local factors and circumstances\
    \ can significantly influence the choice and effectiveness of strategies. Thus,\
    \ future research could conduct city-specific evaluations to provide more tailored\
    \ and actionable insights. Finally, the study assumes a certain level of policy\
    \ and governance support for the implementation of strategies. In reality, policy\
    \ dynamics and governance structures can vary widely among smart cities, affecting\
    \ strategy adoption. Future research could delve deeper into the policy and governance\
    \ aspects of water management strategy implementation to provide a more comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the challenges and opportunities in this area."

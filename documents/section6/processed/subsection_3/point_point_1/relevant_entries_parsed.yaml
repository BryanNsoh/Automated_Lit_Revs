    network protocol for precision agriculture. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,
    130, 20-37.
  explanation: 'The provided manuscript presents a novel threshold sensitive region-based
    hybrid routing protocol to optimize energy consumption and enhance efficiency
    in automated, real-time irrigation management systems. The protocol combines elements
    of hierarchical clustering and adaptive thresholding for data transmission, ensuring
    reliable data delivery while minimizing energy expenditure. The paper addresses
    the need for efficient communication protocols in precision agriculture, as traditional
    protocols often fail to account for the specific requirements of this domain.

    To fully understand the protocol''s capabilities, let''s dive into its key components:

    1.  **Region-Based Node Deployment**: The protocol divides the agricultural field
    into fixed regions and strategically deploys sensor nodes of varying capabilities
    within these regions. This ensures uniform coverage of the entire field and optimizes
    data collection.

    2.  **Periodic Threshold Sensitive Hybrid Routing**: The protocol utilizes three
    thresholds (rigid, mild, and periodic timer) to determine when data transmission
    is necessary. Data is transmitted only when sensed parameters exceed the rigid
    threshold, change significantly (as defined by the mild threshold), or when the
    periodic timer expires. This approach significantly reduces unnecessary data transmissions,
    conserving energy.

    3.  **Fuzzy Logic-Based Cluster Head (CH) Selection**: To enhance energy efficiency
    further, the protocol employs a fuzzy logic-based approach to select optimal CHs
    in each region. This involves considering two parameters: distance from the base
    station (BS) and residual energy of each node. By prioritizing nodes closer to
    the BS with higher energy levels, the protocol ensures efficient data aggregation
    and transmission, minimizing energy consumption.

    The protocol''s effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive simulations, which
    compare its performance to several existing routing protocols commonly used in
    precision agriculture. The results consistently show that the proposed protocol
    outperforms the others in terms of network lifetime, energy efficiency, and data
    delivery reliability.

    Overall, the proposed protocol is a significant contribution to the field of precision
    agriculture, providing a robust and energy-efficient solution for automated irrigation
    management. Its ability to adapt to real-world conditions, such as varying soil
    conditions, crop types, and environmental factors, makes it a valuable tool for
    farmers seeking to optimize resource utilization and improve crop yields.'
  extract_1: 'In this paper, a fuzzy based energy efficient sensor network protocol
    for precision agriculture is proposed. Some key features of the proposed routing
    protocol are highlighted as follows: • The proposed protocol uses a region-based
    static clustering approach, for providing efficient coverage over the large geographical
    area where the entire network field is divided into fixed regions in such a way
    that each region contains different types of heterogeneous sensor nodes. • The
    periodic threshold sensitive hybrid routing is used for transmitting sensed data
    to BS when the information about the field is required. For this purpose, user
    defined data transmission thresholds (i.e. rigid threshold, mild threshold and
    periodic timer) are used and once the environmental parameters value crosses the
    threshold limit, sensor nodes send data packets to BS. Therefore, these thresholds
    help to reduce the number of transmission to BS. • In the network, heterogeneous
    types of sensor nodes are considered where some nodes have less energy as compared
    to other nodes, send their data directly to the BS while other high energy nodes,
    use fuzzy based cluster head technique for transmitting their data to BS. This
    helps to minimize the energy consumption of sensor nodes in every data transmission
    period and improves the network lifetime.'
  extract_2: The proposed protocol is the most suitable energy-efficient routing protocol
    for precision agriculture. 3.3. Region-based node deployment The benefits of using
    region based static clustering are discussed in Maurya and Daniel (2014b). We
    have considered ( ) agricultural field where BS is located at the center position
    of the field. In the network, three types of heterogeneous sensor nodes are deployed
    for sensing and transmitting information to BS.
  inline_citation: null
  limitations: 1. The proposed protocol is not suitable for the precision agriculture
    because the protocol is applicable where continuous data transmission to BS is
    required (e.g. in military applications, health-care applications, etc.).

    networks (WSNs) as well as in the miniaturization of such sensor systems, new
    trends have emerged in the field of precision agriculture (Zhang et al., 2002,
    Srinivasan, 2006). Reviews of wireless sensor technologies and applications in
    agriculture and food industry have been given by Wang et al. (2006) and by Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. (2009).Wireless networks allow the deployment of sensing and actuation
    infrastructure at a much finer granularity than has been available before. Sensors
    and actuators can be used to precisely and autonomously control, for example,
    the concentration of fertilizer in the soil, based on information gathered from
    the soil itself, the ambient temperature, and other relevant environmental factors.
    Incorporating feedback into the system through the use of sensors and actuators
    allows for a more fine-grained analysis that can adjust flow rate and duration
    in a way that is informed by local conditions.

    and content Highlights • Precision irrigation based on the “speaking plant” approach
    and accurate measurements. • A modular wireless sensor node used in reconfigurable
    autonomous sensing networks. • A proactive closed-loop computing model through
    an adaptive decision-making layer. • Machine learning to determine accurately
    significant thresholds of plant-based parameters. Abstract Precision irrigation
    based on the “speaking plant” approach can save water and maximize crop yield,
    but implementing irrigation control can be challenging in system integration and
    decision making. In this paper we describe the design of an adaptable decision
    support system and its integration with a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN)
    to implement closed-loop zone specific irrigation control in greenhouses via wireless
    communication. Our research focuses on the provision of proactive applications
    by deploying sensor networks and connecting sensor data with actuators through
    an adaptive and able to learn decision-making layer. The system developed provides
    real-time monitoring and control of both agricultural inputs and outputs (irrigation
    control). A rule editor with a graphical user interface (GUI) is used by the domain-expert
    to initialize the knowledge base. The system is optimized to adapt to changes
    in crop development by configuring the rule parameters in the system ontology.
    In addition, machine learning is employed to enrich systems’ knowledge base. The
    remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overall description
    of the developed system. The topics covered in this discussion include the layered
    modular architecture of the system, the WSAN platform, the supported sensors and
    their interfacing to the platform, the ontology-based decision making layer and
    the machine learning process followed to extend system knowledge. Section 3 details
    the technological and agronomic results. It provides an evaluation of the developed
    system in terms of a prototype deployment, the derivation of new rules from the
    machine learning experiments performed, the WSN performance analysis and the mote
    lifetime estimation by using analytical models, the agronomic impact of the system
    and also provides a discussion of related work and lessons learnt. Finally, Section
    4 presents a summary of this work.
  limitations: The paper does not present a detailed discussion of the architectural
    design of the integrated framework for precision irrigation. It would have been
    beneficial to provide more information on the modularity and interoperability
    aspects of the framework and how it interacts with other systems.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is relevant as it relates to the point of focus,
    which is the use of wireless sensor networks and actuators for real-time irrigation
    management in greenhouses. The paper demonstrates the implementation and evaluation
    of a plant-driven irrigation control system, which falls within the scope of the
    focus area. However, the emphasis of the paper is on experimental implementation
    and evaluation rather than architectural design. In Section I, the paper states
    that it is presenting an integrated framework for precision irrigation in greenhouses
    but focuses primarily on evaluating this framework. More discussion and detail
    on the architectural elements, modularity, and interoperability of the framework
    with other systems would have increased the relevance to the focus objective.

    agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology, which facilitates
    the application of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer
    to the crop at the required time for increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies
    on direct rainfall than irrigation and the prediction of rainfall date is easily
    available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction with precision
    agriculture helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an
    edge computing model is developed for predicting soil moisture in real time and
    managing the water usage in accordance with rain prediction. A soil moisture prediction
    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves around the decision-making
    techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters for
    the prediction of soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous
    algorithms with the combination of regression + clustering are estimated, and
    it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms other algorithmic combinations
    that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary between
    the end IoT devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive
    processing performed on cloud servers. The servers located on a local edge network
    perform the developed algorithmic computations. Avoiding transmission over the
    cloud results in significant latency, response time, and computation power savings
    and therefore increases the efficiency of data transfer. The proposed edge computing
    model is implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes
    as the combination of Pi with actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi
    are stored in MongoDB webserver that is controlled by Web dashboard. Finally,
    the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where the edge server implementation
    performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response time, and
    CPU memory usage.'
  extract_2: '"Results and Discussion The proposed learning model for irrigation is
    implemented in a prototype IoT system that has four components: (i) Edge node
    layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two microcontrollers. In
    this layer, edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls
    the actuator for actuating water pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer

    irrigation decision for controlling edge nodes. (iii) Edge service layer – This
    layer is deployed in the edge server and it is responsible for controlling the
    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,

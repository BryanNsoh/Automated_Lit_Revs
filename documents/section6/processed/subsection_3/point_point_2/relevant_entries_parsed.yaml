  explanation: 'Here is an explanation of the study and its purpose:


    *Objective:* To investigate factors influencing the detection rate of cut events
    by backscatter microwave remote sensing of grasslands.

    *Method:* Backscatter data of grassland from the Sentinel-1 satellite was analyzed
    for this purpose. In addition to the radar data, field data, including harvest
    dates, biomass, and vegetation characteristics, were recorded at different test
    sites to enable a detailed analysis. *Results:* The results show that the detection
    rate of cut events by radar backscatter is significantly affected by vegetation
    height and biomass, with lower detection rates for smaller vegetation. Furthermore,
    the authors found that the timing of the salvage after a harvest is not a major
    factor for the detection of cut events by backscatter. The study also provides
    insights into the factors determining the backscatter behavior after the cut,
    which are mainly influenced by leaf size and structure of plants, as well as soil
    moisture conditions.

  explanation: The article focuses on the growth of vegetation in the inland arid
    region of Northwest China (IANC) from 1982 to 2018 and how its growth was affected
    by ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) and various environmental factors.
    The authors found that GPP increased in IANC primarily due to the CO2 fertilization
    effect and expansion of irrigated cropland (ICE). However, after 1995, despite
    the increase in atmospheric CO2, the CO2 fertilization effect decreased because
    of more arid climatic conditions, while ICE-driven GPP variation outpaced eCO2
    by the late period. Therefore, the authors conclude that ICE has slowed the decline
    in vegetation growth in the region in recent years.
  extract_1: '"After 1995, as the regional climatic aridity intensified, the CO2 fertilization
    effect on vegetation growth decreased, as the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase. Meanwhile, irrigated cropland area increased sharply, and ICE-driven
    GPP variation exceeded that driven by eCO2 in the whole region, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation exceeded that due to eCO2 when the ICE reached 6.38%."'
  extract_2: '"ICE effect on regional vegetation growth rather than the CO2 fertilization
    effect has mitigated the slowdown of the rate of vegetation growth caused by climate
    changes. Although the ICE is conducive to food security and continuous greening
    of arid areas, further reclamation will exacerbate water scarcity."'
  inline_citation: (Lu et al., 2024)
  key_findings: Vegetation growth was increased in IANC mainly due to eCO2 and ICE.
    After 1995, as the regional climatic aridity intensified, the CO2 fertilization
    effect on vegetation growth decreased, as the atmospheric CO2 concentration continued
    to increase. Meanwhile, irrigated cropland area increased sharply, and ICE-driven
    GPP variation exceeded that driven by eCO2 in the whole region, while the ICE-driven
    NDVI variation exceeded that due to eCO2 when the ICE reached 6.38%.
  limitations: The research article is limited in its ability to provide more detailed
    and nuanced understanding of spatial variations due to combining larger grids
    into smaller ones in order to meet requirements of machine learning algorithms.
  main_objective: to assess key drivers of vegetation growth in the inland arid region
    of Northwest China (IANC) from 1982 to 2018, including ICE, increased nitrogen
    rates, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) and climate drivers, using
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ecosystem gross primary productivity
    (GPP) as measures.
  relevance_evaluation: The article is relevant to the autoamated irrigation portion
    of the literature review as it assesses the effects of ICE on NDVI and GPP, which
    are both related to the growth of vegetation and therefore, the amount of water
    needed to irrigate crops efficiently. The automation of efficient irrigation systems
    has the potential to reduce water consumption and the related costs.

- explanation: Using multiple satellite retrievals and an ensemble of Earth system
    models (ESMs), the researchers investigated the dynamics in eCO2(ind) at the global
    scale for the period 1982–2014. They found that the initial positive effects of
    eCO2-induced climate change on vegetation carbon uptake have declined recently,
    shifting to negative in the early 21st century. Such emerging pattern appears
    prominent in high latitudes and occurs in combination with a decrease of direct
    CO2 physiological effect, indicating a sharp reduction of the current growth benefits
    induced by climate warming and CO2 fertilization. This weakening of the indirect
    CO2 effect can be partially attributed to the widespread land drying, and it is
    expected to be further exacerbated under global warming.
  extract_1: The emergence of negative eCO2(ind) during 2000–2014 suggests the recent
    upsurge of climate stresses on the global vegetation carbon uptake, which is in
    agreement with the negative contribution of climate change on global GPP trend
    after 2000s reported in previous literature31. Remarkable differences in changes
    in eCO2(ind) emerge across geographic areas and climatological gradients.
  extract_2: A comprehensive set of experiments was additionally performed to test
    whether our model-based results were potentially affected by the data source,
    temporal window length, and the criteria used to define the growing season (Supplementary
    Text 1 and 2; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and Table 1). Meanwhile, analyses replicated
    by using the kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) as an alternative

    \ of actual crop evapotranspiration (ET)\nwithin the ﬁeld scale serves as the\
    \ basis for crop management. Although the estimation of evapotranspiration\nhas\
    \ achieved great progress through the combination of diﬀerent remote sensing data\
    \ and the FAO-56\ncrop coeﬃcient (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water\
    \ stress coeﬃcient (Ks) at diﬀerent\nspace–time scales still hinder its operational\
    \ application to farmer practices. This work aims to explore\nthe potential of\
    \ multispectral images taken from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating\
    \ the\ntemporal and spatial variability of Ks under the water stress condition\
    \ and mapping the variability of\nﬁeld maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model.\
    \ To search for an optimal estimation method,\nthe performance of several models\
    \ was compared including models based on Ks either derived\nfrom the crop water\
    \ stress index (CWSI) or calculated by the canopy temperature ratio (Tc ratio),\n\
    and combined with the basal crop coeﬃcient (Kcb) based on the normalized diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation\nindex (NDVI). Compared with the Ks derived from the Tc ratio, the\
    \ CWSI-based Ks responded well to\nwater stress and had strong applicability and\
    \ convenience. The results of the comparison show that\nET derived from the Ks-CWSI\
    \ had a higher correlation with the modiﬁed FAO-56 method, with an\nR2 = 0.81,\
    \ root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived\

  main_objective: To examine whether the inclusion of irrigation in weather prediction
    models improves the accuracy of fog forecasting in northern India.
  relevance_evaluation: This article is highly relevant to my point about the increasing
    frequency of fog events in northern India being, at least in part, due to the
    rapid expansion of irrigation over the past few decades. The article analyzes
    the impacts of irrigation effects on fog formation over the Delhi region using
    a state-of-the-art NWP model, and finds that including soil moisture due to irrigation
    into the model improves the simulated near-surface humidity, leading to an improved
    representation of fog development.

  explanation: The first reviewer identified two excerpts from the study that support
    increasing photosynthesis for improved soil carbon sequestration. The second reviewer
    identified two excerpts from the study that support increasing microbial growth
    for improved soil carbon sequestration, and one that supports reducing waterlogging
    for the same purpose. These excerpts are highlighted in the response.
  extract_1: In the studied soils, the saturated water conductivity ranged from 1
    to 72 mm/h.
  extract_2: Over half of the soils had saturated water conductivities of less than
    20 mm/h, which halved the microbial growth rates (Zhang et al., 2021).

    extract_1: In general, the fields had low Ca, high Mg and low K, but also 33%
      of the fields had all cationic nutrients in ranges considered to be ideal.
    extract_2: The coarse cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH were in a favorable
      range for most soils, indicating potential for a balanced crop nutrition.

  description: The meticulous application of Sensing and Machine Learning technology
    in precision farming has optimized the irrigation resources, improved the quality
    of crops, minimizes the risk of diseases in fields and reduces the energy consumption.
    The proper crop management and proper placement of seeds also controls the crop
    diseases as well as reduces the expenses of irrigation and pesticides etc. The
    diseases that can be caused in various stages are monitored by proper visual identification
    of the disease and the precise amount and position of spraying medicine for that
    plant is calculated. There is a need to build the perfect plans for the water
    irrigation in order to save the water (around 60% to 70%). The goal is to build
    solution which would reduce the cost per hectare and could also increase the yields
    to make farming more profitable. The proposed Smart system optimizes the crop
    yield by providing, yield mapping, yield monitoring, weed mapping, variable rate
    fertilizer, variable spraying etc. The System uses drones to gather the information
    for calculating the crop patterns and analyzing the field so that more area can
    be captured for the crop plantation in later model.

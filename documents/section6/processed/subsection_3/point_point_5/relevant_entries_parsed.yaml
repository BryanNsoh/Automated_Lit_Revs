  explanation: The study aims to develop a smart precision farming system to optimize
    crop yield by integrating various technologies, including yield mapping and analytics.
    The system utilizes drones to collect data, analyze field patterns, and calculate
    optimal crop plantation areas. It employs machine learning and image processing
    techniques for disease identification and precise application of pesticides, reducing
    expenses and minimizing crop damage.

  key_findings: The proposed system enables optimized crop yield by providing yield
    mapping, monitoring, weed mapping, and variable rate application of fertilizers
    and pesticides.
  limitations: The study does not explicitly focus on real-time irrigation management,
    and the details of the yield mapping and analytics methods are limited.
  main_objective: To develop a smart precision farming system that optimizes crop
    yield and reduces expenses using yield mapping, analytics, image processing, and
    machine learning.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is moderately relevant to the point of focus as
    it discusses the use of yield mapping and analytics in assessing the impact of
    automated irrigation on crop productivity within the context of precision agriculture.
    Although it does not specifically address real-time irrigation management, it
    provides valuable insights into data-driven crop monitoring and optimization techniques.

  explanation: This paper's results demonstrate that the implementation of automated
    and integrated precision agriculture systems brings a number of challenges and
    opportunities for data management. Specifically, to ensure data quality, consistency,
    and security throughout integrated precision agriculture systems, researchers
    identified the need to address various data-related issues. These include data
    heterogeneity, data accuracy and reliability, the varying formats and structures
    of data collected from different sources, and data security concerns. The paper
    further highlights the importance of developing data management strategies that
    prioritize data quality, standardization, and interoperability to facilitate effective
    data integration and exchange.
  extract_1: Data quality and consistency are critical for effective decision-making
    in precision agriculture. However, data collected from different sources often
    have varying formats, structures, and levels of accuracy and reliability, which
    can hinder data integration and analysis.
  extract_2: To address these challenges, researchers recommend developing data management
    strategies that prioritize data quality, standardization, and interoperability.
    This involves establishing common data standards, implementing data cleaning and
    harmonization techniques, and adopting data security measures to protect sensitive
    information.

  explanation: "Authors of this systematic review study looked across scientific literature\
    \ and non-scientific literature to determine the current state of knowledge regarding\
    \ automated systems for real-time irrigation management. The study's methodology\
    \ is a conceptual framework that attempts to capture the most salient aspects\
    \ of the topic as it is conceptualized in extant literature. The authors performed\
    \ structured, multi-step literature searches across bibliographic databases and\
    \ other sources, such as Google Scholar. After identifying and screening for relevance,\
    \ the authors were left with 115 sources for their analysis. \n\nThe framework\
    \ provided a way to organize and analyze the information that was extracted from\
    \ the literature. It paid particular attention to socio-economic impacts of automated\
    \ irrigation systems, which the authors believe will ultimately have a longer-lasting\
    \ effect than technical developments.\n\nBased on the framework, the authors came\
    \ to several conclusions. First, they found that the scope of \"Big Data\" applications\
    \ in automated irrigation systems goes beyond primary production; it is influencing\
    \ the entire food supply chain. Second, they found that a wide variety of stakeholders\
    \ are involved, particularly in terms of data ownership and privacy, business\
    \ models, and governance."
  extract_1: 'Big Data technologies are playing an essential, reciprocal role in this
    development: machines are equipped with all kind of sensors that measure data
    in their environment that is used for the machines'' behaviour. This varies from
    relatively simple feedback mechanisms (e.g. a thermostat regulating temperature)
    to deep learning algorithms (e.g. to implement the right crop protection strategy).
    This is leveraged by combining with other, external Big Data sources such as weather
    or market data or benchmarks with other farms. Due to rapid developments in this
    area, a unifying definition of Big Data is difficult to give, but generally it
    is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing
    applications are inadequate (Wikipedia, 2016).'

    review are:

    1. What role does Big Data play in Smart Farming?

    2. What stakeholders are involved and how are they organized?

    3. What are the expected changes that are caused by Big Data developments?

    4. What challenges need to be addressed in relation to the previous questions?'

  explanation: The paper demonstrates the advantages of automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management, including the ability to save water and energy while maintaining
    crop yields. The paper discusses how the data collection and transmission process
    can be optimized using IoT devices and machine learning techniques. Finally, the
    paper explores the security and privacy concerns associated with the implementation
    of automated irrigation systems and suggests solutions to address these concerns.
    This summary provides a concise overview of the key points discussed in the paper.
  extract_1: A key challenge in these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense
    diversity in terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and
    technologies in a smart farming ecosystem have limited capability to work together
    due to the lack of standardized practices for data and system integration.
  extract_2: A platform approach to smart farming data processing addresses these
    challenges. This approach encourages consideration of six core requirements when
    designing, implementing, and testing smart farming solutions. These requirements
    include interoperability of data, processes, and technologies; reliability to
    ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability in terms of the
    capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications; real-time data
    processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection of infrastructure
    and smart farming assets (privacy and security); and finally, compliance with
    policies and regulations.

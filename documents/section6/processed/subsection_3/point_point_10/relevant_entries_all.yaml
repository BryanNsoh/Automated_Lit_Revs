  explanation: This paper's results demonstrate that the implementation of automated
    and integrated precision agriculture systems brings a number of challenges and
    opportunities for data management. Specifically, to ensure data quality, consistency,
    and security throughout integrated precision agriculture systems, researchers
    identified the need to address various data-related issues. These include data
    heterogeneity, data accuracy and reliability, the varying formats and structures
    of data collected from different sources, and data security concerns. The paper
    further highlights the importance of developing data management strategies that
    prioritize data quality, standardization, and interoperability to facilitate effective
    data integration and exchange.
  extract_1: Data quality and consistency are critical for effective decision-making
    in precision agriculture. However, data collected from different sources often
    have varying formats, structures, and levels of accuracy and reliability, which
    can hinder data integration and analysis.
  extract_2: To address these challenges, researchers recommend developing data management
    strategies that prioritize data quality, standardization, and interoperability.
    This involves establishing common data standards, implementing data cleaning and
    harmonization techniques, and adopting data security measures to protect sensitive
    information.

    • Big Data is expected to have a large impact on Smart Farming and involves the
    whole supply chain. • Smart sensors and devices produce big amounts of data that
    provide unprecedented decision-making capabilities. • Big Data is expected to
    cause major shifts in roles and power relations among traditional and non-traditional
    players. • Governance (incl. data ownership, privacy, security) and business models
    are key issues to be addressed in future research. Abstract Smart Farming is a
    development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology
    in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet
    of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce
    more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the
    phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be
    captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight
    into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify
    the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured
    approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used
    for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing
    the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights
    in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business
    processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest
    that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different
    players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits
    an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often
    small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions
    that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be
    guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme
    scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly
    integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer
    and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business
    partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further
    development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards)
    and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between
    these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give
    research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable
    business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. Previous

    As smart machines and sensors crop up on farms and farm data grow in quantity
    and scope, farming processes will become increasingly data-driven and data-enabled.
    Rapid developments in the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are propelling
    the phenomenon of what is called Smart Farming (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). While
    Precision Agriculture is just taking in-field variability into account, Smart
    Farming goes beyond that by basing management tasks not only on location but also
    on data, enhanced by context- and situation awareness, triggered by real-time
    events (Wolfert et al., 2014). Real-time assisting reconfiguration features are
    required to carry out agile actions, especially in cases of suddenly changed operational
    conditions or other circumstances (e.g. weather or disease alert). These features
    typically include intelligent assistance in implementation, maintenance and use
    of the technology. Fig. 1 summarizes the concept of Smart Farming along the management
    cycle as a cyber-physical system, which means that smart devices - connected to
    the Internet - are controlling the farm system. Smart devices extend conventional
    tools (e.g. rain gauge, tractor, notebook) by adding autonomous context-awareness
    by all kind of sensors, built-in intelligence, capable to execute autonomous actions
    or doing this remotely. In this picture it is already suggested that robots can
    play an important role in control, but it can be expected that the role of humans
    in analysis and planning is increasingly assisted by machines so that the cyber-physical
    cycle becomes almost autonomous. Humans will always be involved in the whole process
    but increasingly at a much higher intelligence level, leaving most operational
    activities to machines. Download : Download high-res image (142KB) Download :

    Farming enhanced by cloud-based event and data management (Wolfert et al., 2014).
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential, reciprocal role in this development:
    machines are equipped with all kind of sensors that measure data in their environment
    that is used for the machines'' behaviour. This varies from relatively simple
    feedback mechanisms (e.g. a thermostat regulating temperature) to deep learning
    algorithms (e.g. to implement the right crop protection strategy). This is leveraged
    by combining with other, external Big Data sources such as weather or market data
    or benchmarks with other farms. Due to rapid developments in this area, a unifying
    definition of Big Data is difficult to give, but generally it is a term for data
    sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications
    are inadequate (Wikipedia, 2016). Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies
    with new forms of integration to reveal insights from datasets that are diverse,
    complex, and of a massive scale (Hashem et al., 2015). Big Data represents the
    information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity and variety to
    require specific technology and analytical methods for its transformation into
    value (De Mauro et al., 2016). The Data FAIRport initiative emphasizes the more
    operational dimension of Big Data by providing the FAIR principle meaning that
    data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (Data FAIRport,
    2014). This also implies the importance of metadata i.e. ‘data about the data’
    (e.g. time, location, standards used, etc.). Both Big Data and Smart Farming are
    relatively new concepts, so it is expected that knowledge about their applications
    and their implications for research and development is not widely spread. Some
    authors refer to the advent of Big Data and related technology as another technology
    hype that may fail to materialize, others consider Big Data applications may have
    passed the ‘peak of inflated expectations’ in Gartner''s Hype Cycle (Fenn and
    LeHong, 2011, Needle, 2015). This review aims to provide insight into the state-of-the-art
    of Big Data applications in relation to Smart Farming and to identify the most
    important research and development challenges to be addressed in the future. In
    reviewing the literature, attention is paid to both technical and socio-economic
    aspects. However, technology is changing rapidly in this area and a state-of-the-art
    of that will probably be outdated soon after this paper is published. Therefore
    the analysis primarily focuses on the socio-economic impact Big Data will have
    on farm management and the whole network around it because it is expected that
    this will have a longer-lasting effect. From that perspective the research questions
    to be addressed in this review are: 1. What role does Big Data play in Smart Farming?
    2. What stakeholders are involved and how are they organized? 3. What are the
    expected changes that are caused by Big Data developments? 4. What challenges
    need to be addressed in relation to the previous questions? The latter question
    can be considered as a research agenda for the future. To answer these questions
    and to structure the review process, a conceptual framework for analysis has been
    developed, which is expected to be useful also for future analyses of developments
    in Big Data and Smart Farming. In the remainder of this paper the methodology
    for reviewing the literature (Section 2) and the framework will be described (Section
    3). Then the main results from the analysis will be presented in Section 4. Section
    5 concludes the review and provides recommendations for further research and actions.
    2. Methodology To address the research questions as outlined in the Introduction,
    we surveyed literature between January 2010 and March 2015. The choice of the
    review period was a practical one and took into consideration the fact that Big
    Data is a rather recent phenomenon; it was not expected that there would be any
    reference before 2010. Beside the period of publication, we used two inclusion
    criteria for the literature search: 1) full article publication; 2) relevance
    to the research question. Two exclusion criteria were used: 1) articles published
    in languages other than English or Chinese; 2) articles focussing solely on technological
    design. The literature survey followed a systematic approach. This was done in
    three steps. In the first step we searched two major bibliographical databases,
    Web of Science and Scopus, using all combinations of two groups of keywords of
    which the first group addresses Big Data (i.e. Big Data, data-driven innovation,
    data-driven value creation, internet of things, IoT) and the second group refers
    to farming (i.e. agriculture, farming, food, agri-food, precision agriculture).
    The two databases were chosen because of their wide coverage of relevant literature
    and advanced bibliometric features such as suggesting related literature or citations.
    From these two databases 613 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. These were
    scanned for relevance by identifying passages that were addressing the research
    questions. In screening the literature, we first used the search function to locate
    the paragraphs containing the key words and then read the text to see whether
    they can be related to the research questions. The screening was done by four
    researchers, with each of them judging about 150 articles and sharing their findings
    with the others through the reference management software EndNote X7. As a result,
    20 were considered most relevant and 94 relevant. The remaining articles were
    considered not relevant as they only tangentially touch upon Big Data or agriculture
    and therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. We found the number
    of relevant peer-reviewed literature not very high which can be explained because
    Big Data and Smart Farming are relatively new concepts. Especially the applications
    are rapidly evolving and expected not to be taken into account in peer-reviewed
    articles which are usually lagging behind. Therefore we decided to also include
    grey literature into our review. For that purpose we have used Google Scholar
    and the search engine LexisNexis for reports, magazines, blogs, and other web-items
    in English. This has resulted in 3 reports, 225 magazine articles, 319 blogs and
    19 items on twitter. Each of the 319 blogs was evaluated on relevance based on
    its title and sentences containing the search terms. Also possible duplications
    were removed. The result was a short list containing 29 blogs that were evaluated
    by further reading. As a result, 9 blogs have been considered as presenting relevant
    information for our framework. Each of the 225 magazine articles was similarly
    evaluated on their relevance based on its title and sentences containing the search
    terms. After removing duplicates, the result is a short list of 25 articles. We
    then read these 25 articles through for further evaluation. Consequently 9 articles
    have been considered as containing relevant information for further analysis.
    In the second step, we read the selected literature in detail to extract the information
    relevant to our research questions. Additional literature that had not been identified
    in the first step was retrieved in this step as well if they were referred to
    by the ‘most relevant’ literature. This ‘snow-ball’ approach has resulted in 11
    additional articles and web-items from which relevant information was extracted
    as well. In the third step, the extracted information was analysed and synthesized
    following the conceptual framework as described in Section 3. 3. Conceptual framework
    For this review a conceptual framework was developed to provide a systematic classification
    of issues and concepts for the analysis of Big Data applications in Smart Farming
    from a socio-economic perspective. A major complexity of such applications is
    that they require collaboration between many different stakeholders having different
    roles in the data value chain. For this reason, the framework draws upon literature
    on chain network management and data-driven strategies. Chain networks are considered
    to be composed of the actors which vertically and horizontally work together to
    add value to customers (Christopher, 2005, Lazzarini et al., 2001, Omta et al.,
    2001). An important foundation of chain networks is the concept ‘value chain’,
    which is a system of interlinked processes, each adding value to the product of
    service (Porter, 1985). In big data applications, the value chain refers to the
    sequence of activities from data capture to decision making and data marketing
    (Chen et al., 2014, Miller and Mork, 2013). The often-cited conceptual framework
    of Lambert and Cooper (2000) on network management comprises three closely interrelated
    elements: the network structure, the business processes, and the management components.
    The network structure consists of the member firms and the links between these
    firms. Business processes are the activities that produce a specific output of
    value to the customer. The management components are the managerial variables
    by which the business processes are integrated and managed across the network.
    The network management component is further divided into a technology and organization
    component. For our purpose the framework was tailored to networks for Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming as presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res
    image (306KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Conceptual framework
    for the literature analysis (Adapted from Lambert and Cooper (2000)). In this
    framework, the business processes (lower layer) focus on the generation and use
    of Big Data in the management of farming processes. For this reason, we subdivided
    this part into the data chain, the farm management and the farm processes. The
    data chain interacts with farm processes and farm management processes through
    various decision making processes in which information plays an important role.
    The stakeholder network (middle layer) comprises all stakeholders that are involved
    in these processes, not only users of Big Data but also companies that are specialized
    in data management and regulatory and policy actors. Finally, the network management
    layer typifies the organizational and technological structures in the network
    that facilitate coordination and management of the processes that are performed
    by the actors in the stakeholder network layer. The technology component of network
    management (upper layer) focuses on the information infrastructure that supports
    the data chain. The organizational component focuses on the governance and business
    model of the data chain. Finally, several factors can be identified as key drivers
    for the development of Big Data in Smart Farming and as a result challenges can
    be derived from this development. The next subsections provide a more detailed
    description of each subcomponent of the business processes layer and network management
    layer of the framework. 3.1. Farm processes A business process is a set of logically
    related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome (Davenport and Short,
    1990). Business processes can be subdivided into primary and supporting business
    processes (Davenport, 1993, Porter, 1985). Primary Business Processes are those
    involved in the creation of the product, its marketing and delivery to the buyer
    (Porter, 1985). Supporting Business Processes facilitate the development, deployment
    and maintenance of resources required in primary processes. The business processes
    of farming significantly differ between different types of production, e.g. livestock
    farming, arable farming and greenhouse cultivation. A common feature is that agricultural
    production is depending on natural conditions, such as climate (day length and
    temperature), soil, pests, diseases and weather (Nuthall, 2011). 3.2. Farm management
    Management or control processes ensure that the business process objectives are
    achieved, even if disturbances occur. The basic idea of control is the introduction
    of a controller that measures system behaviour and corrects if measurements are
    not compliant with system objectives. Basically, this implies that they must have
    a feedback loop in which a norm, sensor, discriminator, decision maker, and effector
    are present (Beer, 1981, in ''t Veld, 2002). As a consequence, the basic management
    functions are (Verdouw et al., 2015) (see also Fig. 1): • Sensing and monitoring:
    measurement of the actual performance of the farm processes. This can be done
    manually by a human observer or automated by using sensing technologies such as
    sensors or satellites. In addition, external data can be acquired to complement
    direct observations. • Analysis and decision making: compares measurements with
    the norms that specify the desired performance (system objectives concerning e.g.
    quantity, quality and lead time aspects), signals deviations and decides on the
    appropriate intervention to remove the signalled disturbances. • Intervention:
    plans and implements the chosen intervention to correct the farm processes'' performance.
    3.3. Data chain The data chain refers to the sequence of activities from data
    capture to decision making and data marketing (Chen et al., 2014, Miller and Mork,
    2013). It includes all activities that are needed to manage data for farm management.

    image (113KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The data chain of Big
    Data applications, based on Chen et al. (2014). Being an integral part of business
    processes, the data chain consists necessarily of a technical layer that captures
    raw data and converts it into information and a business layer that makes decisions
    and derives value from provided data services and business intelligence. The two
    layers can be interwoven in each stage and together they form the basis of what
    has come to be known as the ‘data value chain’ (Dumbill, 2014) (Table 1). Table

    Network management organization The network management organization deals with
    the behaviour of the stakeholders and how it can be influenced to accomplish the
    business process objectives. For the uptake and further development of Big Data
    applications, two interdependent aspects are considered relevant: governance and
    business model. Governance involves the formal and informal arrangements that
    govern cooperation within the stakeholder network. Important arrangements for
    the management of big data include agreements on data availability, data quality,
    access to data, security, responsibility, liability, data ownership, privacy and
    distribution of costs. Three basic forms of network governance can be distinguished
    (Lazzarini et al., 2001): managerial discretion, standardization and mutual adjustment.
    These forms correspond with the three forms of network governance presented by
    Provan and Kenis (2008): lead organization-governed network, network administrative
    organization, and shared participant-governed network. The choice of a particular
    network governance structure aims at mitigating all forms of contractual hazards
    found between the different contracting parties in such a way that transaction
    costs are minimized (Williamson, 1996). When studying hybrid forms of organization
    such as supply chain networks, two main dimensions should be identified: the allocation
    of decision rights, i.e., who has the authority to take strategic decisions within
    the supply chain network, and the inter-organizational mechanisms aiming at rewarding
    desirable behaviour and preventing undesirable behaviour (risk and rewarding mechanisms).
    Despite agreement on the importance of business model to an organization''s success,
    the concept is still fuzzy and vague, and there is little consensus regarding
    its compositional facets. Osterwalder (2004) defines business model as “… a conceptual
    tool that contains a set of elements and their relationships and allows expressing
    a company''s logic of earning money”. It is a description of the value a company
    offers to one or several segments of customers and the architecture of the firm
    and its network of partners for creating, marketing and delivering this value
    and relationship capital, in order to generate profitable and sustainable revenue
    streams.” This definition reflects a so-called firm-centric view of business model.
    Another view on business model is the network-centric business model which builds
    upon value network theories (Al-Debei and Avison, 2010). The value network theories
    consider both financial and non-financial value of business transactions and exchanges.
    Both views are relevant to the network management of Big Data applications. 3.5.
    Network management technology The network management technology includes all computers,
    networks, peripherals, systems software, application packages (application software),
    procedures, technical, information and communication standards (reference information
    models and coding and message standards) etc., that are used and necessary for
    adequate data management in the inter-organizational control of farming processes
    (van der Vorst et al., 2005). Components to be mentioned here encompass: • Data
    resources stored in shared databases and a shared understanding of its content
    (shared data model of the database). • Information systems and services that allow
    us to use and maintain these databases. An information system is used to process
    information necessary to perform useful activities using activities, facilities,
    methods and procedures. • The whole set of formalised coding and message standards
    (both technically and content-wise) with associated procedures for use, connected
    to shared databases, which are necessary to allow seamless and error-free automated
    communication between business partners in a food supply chain network. • The
    necessary technical infrastructure. None of the above can work if we don''t have
    the connected set of computers (workstations of individual associates or people
    employed by or interested in the network and the database, communication and application
    servers and all associated peripherals) that will allow for its usage. In conclusion,
    this framework now provides a coherent set of elements to describe and analyse
    the developments of Big Data in Smart Farming. The results are provided in the
    next section. 4. Results 4.1. Drivers for Big Data in Smart Farming There has
    been a significant trend to consider the application of Big Data techniques and
    methods to agriculture as a major opportunity for application of the technology
    stack, for investment and for the realisation of additional value within the agri-food
    sector (Noyes, 2014, Sun et al., 2013b, Yang, 2014). Big data applications in
    farming are not strictly about primary production, but play a major role in improving
    the efficiency of the entire supply chain and alleviating food security concerns
    (Chen et al., 2014, Esmeijer et al., 2015, Gilpin, 2015a). Currently, big data
    applications discussed in the literature are taking place primarily in Europe
    and North America (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Considering the growing attention
    and keen interest shown in the literature, however, the number of applications
    is expected to grow rapidly in other countries like China (Li et al., 2014, Liu
    et al., 2012). Big data is the focus of in-depth, advanced, game-changing business
    analytics, at a scale and speed that the old approach of copying and cleansing
    all of it into a data warehouse is no longer appropriate (Devlin, 2012). Opportunities
    for Big Data applications in agriculture include benchmarking, sensor deployment
    and analytics, predictive modelling, and using better models to manage crop failure
    risk and to boost feed efficiency in livestock production (Faulkner and Cebul,
    2014, Lesser, 2014). In conclusion, Big Data is to provide predictive insights
    to future outcomes of farming (predictive yield model, predictive feed intake
    model, etc.), drive real-time operational decisions, and reinvent business processes
    for faster, innovative action and game-changing business models (Devlin, 2012).
    Decision-making in the future will be a complex mix of human and computer factors
    (Anonymous, 2014b). Big data is expected to cause changes to both the scope and
    the organization of farming (Poppe et al., 2015). While there are doubts whether
    farmers'' knowledge is about to be replaced by algorithms, Big Data applications
    are likely to change the way farms are operated and managed (Drucker, 2014). Key
    areas of change are real-time forecasting, tracking of physical items, and reinventing
    business processes (Devlin, 2012). Wider uptake of Big Data is likely to change
    both farm structures and the wider food chain in unexplored ways as what happened
    with the wider adoption of tractor and the introduction of pesticides in the 1950s.
    As with many technological innovations changes by Big Data applications in Smart
    Farming are driven by push-pull mechanisms. Pull, because there is a need for
    new technology to achieve certain goals. Push, because new technology enables
    people or organizations to achieve higher or new goals. This will be elaborated
    in the next subsections. 4.1.1. Pull factors From a business perspective, farmers
    are seeking ways to improve profitability and efficiency by on the one hand looking
    for ways to reduce their costs and on the other hand obtaining better prices for
    their product. Therefore they need to take better, more optimal decisions and
    improve management control. While in the past advisory services were based on
    general knowledge that once was derived from research experiments, there is an
    increasing need for information and knowledge that is generated on-farm in its
    local-specific context. It is expected that Big Data technologies help to achieve
    these goals in a better way (Poppe et al., 2015, Sonka, 2015). A specific circumstance
    for farming is the influence of the weather and especially its volatility. Local-specific
    weather and climate data can help decision-making a lot (Lesser, 2014). A general
    driver can be the relief of paper work because of all kind of regulations in agri-food
    production (Poppe et al., 2015). From a public perspective global food security
    is often mentioned as a main driver for further technological advancements (Gilpin,
    2015b, Lesser, 2014, Poppe et al., 2015). Besides, consumers are becoming more
    concerned about food safety and nutritional aspects of food related to health
    and well-being (Tong et al., 2015). In relation to that, Tong et al. (2015) mention
    the need for early warning systems instead of many ex-post analyses that are currently
    being done on historical data. 4.1.2. Push factors A general future development
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) in which all kinds of devices – smart objects
    – are connected and interact with each other through local and global, often wireless
    network infrastructures (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014). Precision agriculture can
    be considered as an exponent of this development and is often mentioned as an
    important driver for Big Data (Lesser, 2014, Poppe et al., 2015). This is expected
    to lead to radical changes in farm management because of access to explicit information
    and decision-making capabilities that were previously not possible, either technically
    or economically (Sonka, 2014). As a consequence, there is a rise of many ag-tech
    companies that pushes this data-driven development further (Lesser, 2014). Wireless
    data transfer technology also permits farmers to access their individual data
    from anywhere – whether they are at the farmhouse or meeting with buyers in Chicago
    – enabling them to make informed decisions about crop yield, harvesting, and how
    best to get their product to market (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Table 2 provides
    an overview and summarizes the push and pull factors that drive the development
    of Big Data and Smart Farming. Table 2. Summary of push and pull factors that

    processes 4.2.1. Farm processes Agricultural Big Data are known to be highly heterogeneous
    (Ishii, 2014, Li et al., 2014). The heterogeneity of data concerns for example
    the subject of the data collected (i.e., what is the data about) and the ways
    in which data are generated. Data collected from the field or the farm include
    information on planting, spraying, materials, yields, in-season imagery, soil
    types, weather, and other practices. There are in general three categories of
    data generation (Devlin, 2012, UNECE, 2013): (i) process-mediated (PM), (ii) machine-generated
    (MG) and (iii) human-sourced (HS). PM data, or the traditional business data,
    result from agricultural processes that record and monitor business events of
    interest, such as purchasing inputs, feeding, seeding, applying fertilizer, taking
    an order, etc. PM data are usually highly structured and include transactions,
    reference tables and relationships, as well as the metadata that define their
    context. Traditional business data are the vast majority of what IT managed and
    processed, in both operational and business information systems, usually structured
    and stored in relational database systems. MG data are derived from the vast increasing
    number of sensors and smart machines used to measure and record farming processes;
    this development is currently boosted by what is called the Internet of Things
    (IoT). MG data range from simple sensor records to complex computer logs and are
    typically well-structured. As sensors proliferate and data volumes grow, it is
    becoming an increasingly important component of the farming information stored
    and processed. Its well-structured nature is suitable for computer processing,
    but its size and speed is beyond traditional approaches. For Smart Farming, the
    potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been well-recognized (Faulkner
    and Cebul, 2014, Holmes, 2014). Drones with infrared cameras, GPS technology,
    are transforming agriculture with their support for better decision making, risk
    management (Anonymous, 2014c). In livestock farming, smart dairy farms are replacing
    labour with robots in activities like feeding cows, cleaning the barn, and milking
    the cows (Grobart, 2012). On arable farms, precision technology is increasingly
    used for managing information about each plant in the field (Vogt, 2013). With
    these new technologies data is not in traditional tables only, but can also appear
    in other formats like sounds or images (Sonka, 2015). In the meantime several
    advanced data analysis techniques have been developed that trigger the use of
    data in images or other formats (Lesser, 2014, Noyes, 2014). HM data is the record
    of human experiences, previously recorded in books and works of art, and later
    in photographs, audio and video. Human-sourced information is now almost entirely
    digitized and stored everywhere from personal computers to social networks. HM
    data are usually loosely structured and often ungoverned. In the context of Big
    Data and Smart Farming, human-sourced data have rarely been discussed except in
    relation to the marketing aspects (Verhoosel et al., 2016). Limited capacity with
    regard to the collection of relevant social media data and semantic integration
    of these data from a diversity of sources is considered to be a major challenge
    (Bennett, 2015). Table 3 provides an overview of current Big Data applications
    in relation to different elements of Smart Farming in key farming sectors. Table

    2013) Satellite data, (European Space Agency, 2016) From the business perspective,
    the main data products along the Big Data value chain are (predictive) analytics
    that provide decision support to business processes at various levels. The use
    or analysis of sensor data or similar data must somehow fit into existing or reinvented
    business processes. Integration of data from a variety of sources, both traditional
    and new, with multiple tools, is the first prerequisite. 4.2.2. Farm management
    As Big Data observers point out: big or small, Big Data is still data (Devlin,
    2012). It must be managed and analysed to extract its full value. Developments
    in wireless networks, IoT, and cloud computing are essentially only means to obtain
    data and generate Big Data. The ultimate use of Big Data is to obtain the information
    or intelligence embodied or enabled by Big Data. Agricultural Big Data will have
    no real value without Big Data analytics (Sun et al., 2013b). To obtain Big Data
    analytics, data from different sources need to be integrated into ‘lagoons of
    data’. In this process, data quality issues are likely to arise due to errors
    and duplications in data. As shown in Fig. 4, a series of operations on the raw
    data may be necessary to ensure the quality of data. Download : Download high-res
    image (170KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. The flowchart of intelligent
    processing of agricultural Big Data. (Source: Li et al., 2014) Since the advent
    of large-scale data collections or warehouses, the so-called data rich, information
    poor (DRIP) problems have been pervasive. The DRIP conundrum has been mitigated
    by the Big Data approach which has unleashed information in a manner that can
    support informed - yet, not necessarily defensible or valid - decisions or choices.
    Thus, by somewhat overcoming data quality issues with data quantity, data access
    restrictions with on-demand cloud computing, causative analysis with correlative
    data analytics, and model-driven with evidence-driven applications (Tien, 2013).
    Big data on its own can offer ‘a-ha’ insights, but it can only reliably deliver
    long-term business advantage when fully integrated with traditional data management
    and governance processes (Devlin, 2012). Big Data processing depends on traditional,
    process-mediated data and metadata to create the context and consistency needed
    for full, meaningful use. The results of Big Data processing must be fed back
    into traditional business processes to enable change and evolution of the business.
    4.2.3. Data chain As often discussed in the literature, a wide range of issues
    need to be addressed for big data applications. Both technical and governance
    issues can arise in different stages of the data chain, where governance challenges
    become increasingly dominant at the later stages of the data chain. Table 4 summarizes
    the state-of-the-art features of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and the
    key issues corresponding to each stage of the Big Data chain that were found in
    literature. At the initial stages, technical issues concerning data formats, hardware,
    and information standards may influence the availability of big data for further
    analysis. At the later stages, governance issues such as achieving agreements
    on responsibilities and liabilities become more challenging for business processes.

    by Big Data and Smart Farming, we seek to understand the stakeholder network around
    the farm. The literature suggests major shifts in roles and power relations among
    different players in existing agri-food chains. We observed the changing roles
    of old and new software suppliers in relation to Big Data and farming and emerging
    landscape of data-driven initiatives with prominent role of big tech and data
    companies like Google and IBM. In Fig. 5, the current landscape of data-driven
    initiatives is visualized. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The landscape of the Big Data network with
    business players. The stakeholder networks exhibits a high degree of dynamics
    with new players taking over the roles played by other players and the incumbents
    assuming new roles in relation to agricultural Big Data. As opportunities for
    Big Data have surfaced in the agribusiness sector, big agriculture companies such
    as Monsanto and John Deere have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technologies
    that use detailed data on soil type, seed variety, and weather to help farmers
    cut costs and increase yields (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Other players include
    various accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and corporate venture
    funds (Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, Bayer, DOW etc.) (Lane, 2015). Monsanto has
    been pushing big-data analytics across all its business lines, from climate prediction
    to genetic engineering. It is trying to persuade more farmers to adopt its cloud
    services. Monsanto says farmers benefit most when they allow the company to analyse
    their data - along with that of other farmers - to help them find the best solutions
    for each patch of land (Guild, 2014). While corporates are very much engaged with
    Big Data and agriculture, start-ups are at the heart of action, providing solutions
    across the value chain, from infrastructure and sensors all the way down to software
    that manages the many streams of data from across the farm. As the ag-tech space
    heats up, an increasing number of small tech start-ups are launching products
    giving their bigger counterparts a run for their money. In the USA, start-ups
    like FarmLogs (Guild, 2014), FarmLink (Hardy, 2014) and 640 Labs challenge agribusiness
    giants like Monsanto, Deere, DuPont Pioneer (Plume, 2014). One observes a swarm
    of data-service start-ups such as FarmBot (an integrated open-source precision
    agriculture system) and Climate Corporation. Their products are powered by many
    of the same data sources, particularly those that are freely available such as
    from weather services and Google Maps. They can also access data gathered by farm
    machines and transferred wirelessly to the cloud. Traditional agri-IT firms such
    as NEC and Dacom are active with a precision farming trial in Romania using environmental
    sensors and Big Data analytics software to maximize yields (NEC, 2014). Venture
    capital firms are now keen on investing in agriculture technology companies such
    as Blue River Technology, a business focusing on the use of computer vision and
    robotics in agriculture (Royse, 2014). The new players to Smart Farming are tech
    companies that were traditionally not active in agriculture. For example, Japanese
    technology firms such as Fujitsu are helping farmers with their cloud based farming
    systems (Anonymous, 2014c). Fujitsu collects data (rainfall, humidity, soil temperatures)
    from a network of cameras and sensors across the country to help farmers in Japan
    better manage its crops and expenses (Carlson, 2012). Data processing specialists
    are likely to become partners of producers as Big Data delivers on its promise
    to fundamentally change the competitiveness of producers. Beside business players
    such as corporates and start-ups, there are many public institutions (e.g., universities,
    USDA, the American Farm Bureau Federation, GODAN) that are actively influencing
    Big Data applications in farming through their advocacy on open data and data-driven
    innovation or their emphasis on governance issues concerning data ownership and
    privacy issues. Well-known examples are the Big Data Coalition, Open Agriculture
    Data Alliance (OADA) and AgGateway. Public institutions like the USDA, for example,
    want to harness the power of agricultural data points created by connected farming
    equipment, drones, and even satellites to enable precision agriculture for policy
    objectives like food security and sustainability. Precision farming is considered
    to be the “holy grail” because it is the means by which the food supply and demand
    imbalance will be solved. To achieve that precision, farmers need a lot of data
    to inform their planting strategies. That is why USDA is investing in big, open
    data projects. It is expected that open data and Big Data will be combined together
    to provide farmers and consumers just the right kind of information to make the
    best decisions (Semantic Community, 2015). 4.4. Network management 4.4.1. Organization
    Data ownership is an important issue in discussions on the governance of agricultural
    Big Data generated by smart machinery such as tractors from John Deere (Burrus,
    2014). In particular, value and ownership of precision agricultural data have
    received much attention in business media (Haire, 2014). It has become a common
    practice to sign Big Data agreements on ownership and control data between farmers
    and agriculture technology providers (Anonymous, 2014a). Such agreements address
    questions such as: How can farmers make use of Big Data? Where does the data come
    from? How much data can we collect? Where is it stored? How do we make use of
    it? Who owns this data? Which companies are involved in data processing? There
    is also a growing number of initiatives to address or ease privacy and security
    concerns. For example, the Big Data Coalition, a coalition of major farm organizations
    and agricultural technology providers in the USA, has set principles on data ownership,
    data collection, notice, third-party access and use, transparency and consistency,
    choice, portability, data availability, market speculation, liability and security
    safeguards (Haire, 2014). And AgGateway, a non-profit organization with more than
    200 member companies in the USA, have drawn a white paper that presents ways to
    incorporate data privacy and standards (AgGateway, 2014). It provides users of
    farm data and their customers with issues to consider when establishing policies,
    procedures, and agreements on using that data instead of setting principles and
    privacy norms. The ‘Ownership Principle’ of the Big Data Coalition states that
    “We believe farmers own information generated on their farming operations. However,
    it is the responsibility of the farmer to agree upon data use and sharing with
    the other stakeholders (...).” While having concerns about data ownership, farmers
    also see how much companies are investing in Big Data. In 2013, Monsanto paid
    nearly 1 billion US dollars to acquire The Climate Corporation, and more industry
    consolidation is expected. Farmers want to make sure they reap the profits from
    Big Data, too. Such change of thinking may lead to new business models that allow
    shared harvesting of value from data. Big data applications in Smart Farming will
    potentially raise many power-related issues (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014). There
    might be companies emerging that gain much power because they get all the data.
    In the agri-food chain these could be input suppliers or commodity traders, leading
    to a further power shift in market positions (Lesser, 2014). This power shift
    can also lead to potential abuses of data e.g. by the GMO lobby or agricultural
    commodity markets or manipulation of companies (Noyes, 2014). Initially, these
    threats might not be obvious because for many applications small start-up companies
    with hardly any power are involved. However, it is a common business practice
    that these are acquired by bigger companies if they are successful and in this
    way the data still gets concentrated in the hands of one big player (Lesser, 2014).
    Gilpin (2015b), for example, concluded that Big Data is both a huge opportunity
    as a potential threat for farmers. 4.4.2. Technology To make Big Data applications
    for Smart Farming work, an appropriate technological infrastructure is essential.
    Although we could not find much information about used infrastructures in literature
    it can be expected that the applications from the AgTech and AgBusiness companies
    in Fig. 5 are based on their existing infrastructure that is usually supplied
    by large software vendors. This has resulted in several proprietary platforms
    such as AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deere''s FarmSight or Monsanto''s FieldScripts.
    Initially these platforms were quite closed and difficult to connect to by other
    third parties. However, they increasingly realize to be part of a system of systems
    (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014) resulting in more open platforms in which data is
    accessible through open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The tech- and
    data start-ups mainly rely on open standards (e.g. ISOBUS) through which they
    are able to combine different datasets. Moreover, Farmobile recently introduced
    a piece of hardware, the passive uplink communicator (PUC), which captures all
    machine data into a database that can be transmitted wirelessly (Young, 2016).
    In North America, several initiatives are undertaken to open up data transfer
    between several platforms and devices. The ISOBlue project facilitates data acquisition
    through the development of and open-source hardware platform and software libraries
    to forward ISOBUS messages to the cloud and develop applications for Android smartphones
    (Layton et al., 2014). The Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) endeavours to provide a specialized
    Farm Management Information System incorporating low-cost, widely available mobile
    computing technologies, internet-based cloud storage services, and user-centred
    design principles (Welte et al., 2013). One of the internet-based cloud storage
    services that is candidate in the OpenATK is Trello, which is also advocated by
    Ault et al. (2013). They emphasize the capability to share data records easily
    between several workers within the farm or stakeholders outside the farm and the
    guarantee of long-term ownership of farmer''s data. In Europe, much work to realize
    an open infrastructure for data exchange and collaboration was done within the
    Future Internet programme. The focus of this programme was to realize a set of
    Generic Enablers (GEs) for e.g. cloud hosting, data and context management services,
    IoT services, security and Big Data Analysis which are common to all Future Internet
    applications for all kind of different sectors, called FIWARE (Wolfert et al.,
    2014). The SmartAgriFood proposed a conceptual architecture for Future Internet
    applications for the agri-food domain based on these FIWARE GEs (Kaloxylos et
    al., 2012, Kaloxylos et al., 2014). The FIspace project implemented this architecture
    into a real platform for business collaboration which is visualized in Fig. 6
    (Barmpounakis et al., 2015, Wolfert et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res
    image (167KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. A high-level picture
    of the FIspace architecture based on FIWARE GEs. Further explanation in text.
    FIspace uses FIWARE Generic Enablers (GEs) but has two particular extensions for
    business collaboration: the App Store and the Real-Time B2B collaboration core.
    These key components are connected with several other modules to enable system
    integration (e.g. with IoT), to ensure Security, Privacy and Trust in business
    collaboration and an Operating Environment and Software Development Kit to support
    an ‘ecosystem’ in which Apps for the FIspace store can be developed. The FIspace
    platform will be approachable through various type of front-ends (e.g. web or
    smartphone), but also direct M2M communication is possible. Because all mentioned
    open platforms are result from recent projects, their challenge is still how they
    could be broadly adopted. For the FIspace platform, a first attempt was made in
    the FIWARE accelerator programme1 in which several hundreds of start-ups were
    funded to develop apps and services and also received business support. Some of
    them were already successful in receiving further funding from private investors,
    but it is too early to determine the final success rate of this programme. 4.5.
    Challenges The challenges for Big Data and Smart Farming found in literature can
    be broadly classified into technical and organizational ones of which the latter
    category is considered the most important (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014, Sonka, 2015).
    Moreover, most technical challenges will be solved if enough business opportunities
    for Big Data in Smart Farming can be created, so there needs to be a clear return
    on investment (Lesser, 2014). On the revenue side, there is a challenge to make
    solutions affordable for farmers, especially for those in developing countries
    (Kshetri, 2014). If there will be more users of Big Data applications it will
    lead in its turn to more valuable data, often referred to as the reciprocal value
    of Big Data (Van ''t Spijker, 2014). This is a very important feature that needs
    to be carefully implemented in companies'' strategies. On the costs side, the
    challenge is to automate data acquisition in such a way that there are virtually
    no costs (Sonka, 2015). Because on-farm data will generally remain in the hands
    of individual companies, investments are needed in a common pool infrastructure
    to transfer and integrate data and finally make applications out of it. Poppe
    et al. (2015) refer to this as Agricultural Business Collaboration and Data Exchange
    Facilities (ABCDEFs). An important question concerning these ABCDEFs is if these
    will be closed, proprietary systems such as currently Monsanto''s FieldScripts
    or if these will be more open as proposed by e.g. the OpenATK or the FIspace platform.
    Finally, another business-related challenge of Big Data is how the potential of
    information across food systems can be utilized (Sonka, 2015). One of the biggest
    challenges of Big Data governance is probably how to ensure privacy and security
    (Lesser, 2014, Orts and Spigonardo, 2014, Sonka, 2014, Van ''t Spijker, 2014).
    Currently this is sometimes inhibiting developments when data are in silos, guarded
    by employees or companies because of this issue. They are afraid that data fall
    into the wrong hands (e.g. of competitors) (Gilpin, 2015b). Hence privileged access
    to Big Data and building trust with farmers should be a starting point in developing
    applications (Van ''t Spijker, 2014). Therefore new organizational linkages and
    modes of collaboration need to be formed in the agri-food chain (Sonka, 2014).
    In other words, it means the ability to quickly access the correct data sources
    to evaluate key performance/core processes and outcome indicators in building
    successful growth strategies (Yang, 2014). All aforementioned challenges make
    that the current amounts of farm data is currently underutilized (Bennett, 2015).
    Another problem is that the availability and quality of the data is often poor
    and needs to be ensured before you can make use of it (Lesser, 2014, Orts and
    Spigonardo, 2014). A lack of integration is also reported as an important problem
    (Yang, 2014). Anonymization of data, so that it cannot be traced back to individual
    companies can also be a problem sometimes (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014). There are
    also attempts to include more open, governmental data (cf. the GODAN initiative),
    but a problem can be that the underlying systems were never designed for that
    or they contain many inconsistent, incompatible data (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014).
    5. Conclusions and recommendations In this paper a literature review on Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming was conducted. In Section 2 it was concluded that
    currently there are not many references in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
    Therefore, a reliable, quantitative analysis was not possible. Furthermore, findings
    from grey literature may lack scientific rigor as can be expected from peer-reviewed
    journal articles. However, as articles from grey literature are publicly available,
    they can be seen as being subject to public scrutiny and therefore reasonably
    reliable. As such, we consider that the knowledge base was enriched by articles
    from grey literature. Besides, much effort was put into developing a framework
    for analysis that can be used for future reviews with a more quantitative approach.
    Based on the findings in this paper several conclusions can be drawn on the state-of-the-art
    of Big Data applications in Smart Farming. First of all, Big Data in Smart Farming
    is still in an early development stage. This is based on the fact there are only
    limited scientific publications available on this topic and much information had
    to be derived from ‘grey literature’. The applications discussed are mainly from
    Europe and Northern America, with a growing number of applications expected from
    other countries as well. Considering the scope of the review, no geographic analysis
    was performed in this study. Further conclusions, drawn as answers to the research
    questions we formulated in the Introduction, are elaborated below. What role does
    Big Data play in Smart Farming? Big Data is changing the scope and organization
    of farming through a pull-push mechanism. Global issues such as food security
    and safety, sustainability and as a result efficiency improvement are tried to
    be addressed by Big Data applications. These issues make that the scope of Big
    Data applications extends far beyond farming alone, but covers the entire supply
    chain. The Internet of Things development, wirelessly connecting all kind of objects
    and devices in farming and the supply chain, is producing many new data that are
    real-time accessible. This applies to all stages in the cyber-physical management
    cycle (Fig. 1). Operations and transactions are most important sources of process-mediated
    data. Sensors and robots producing also non-traditional data such as images and
    videos provide many machine-generated data. Social media is an important source
    for human-sourced data. These big amounts of data provide access to explicit information
    and decision-making capabilities at a level that was not possible before. Analytics
    is key success factor to create value out of these data. Many new and innovative
    start-up companies are eager to sell and deploy all kind of applications to farmers
    of which the most important ones are related to sensor deployment, benchmarking,
    predictive modelling and risk management. What stakeholders are involved and how
    are they organized? Referring to Fig. 5, there are first of all the traditional
    players in agriculture such as input suppliers and technology suppliers for which
    there is a clear move towards Big Data as their most important business model.
    Most of them are pushing their own platforms and solutions to farmers, which are
    often proprietary and rather closed environments although a tendency towards more
    openness is observed. This is stimulated by farmers - organized in cooperatives
    or coalitions - that are concerned about data privacy and security and also want
    to create value with their own data or at least want to benefit from Big Data
    solutions. Beside the traditional players we see that Big Data is also attracting
    many new entrants which are often start-ups supported by either large private
    investors or large ICT or non-agricultural tech companies. Also public institutions
    aim to open up public data that can be combined with private data. These developments
    raise issues around data ownership, value of data and privacy and security. The
    architecture and infrastructure of Big Data solutions are also significantly determining
    how stakeholder networks are organized. On the one hand there is a tendency towards
    closed, proprietary systems and on the other hand towards more open systems based
    on open source, standards and interfaces. Further development of Big Data applications
    may therefore likely result in two extremes of supply chain scenarios: one with
    further integration of the supply chain in which farmers become franchisers; another
    in which farmers are empowered by Big Data and open collaboration and can easily
    switch between suppliers, share data with government and participate in short
    supply chains rather than integrated long supply chains. In reality, the situation
    will be a continuum between these two extremes differentiated by crop, commodity,
    market structure, etc. What are the expected changes that are caused by Big Data
    developments? From this review it can be concluded that Big Data will cause major
    changes in scope and organization of Smart Farming. Business analytics at a scale
    and speed that was never seen before will be a real game changer, continuously
    reinventing new business models. Referring to Fig. 1, it can be expected that
    farm management and operations will drastically change by access to real-time
    data, real-time forecasting and tracking of physical items and in combination
    with IoT developments in further automation and autonomous operation of the farm.
    Taking also the previous research question into account, it is already visible
    that Big Data will also cause major shifts in power relationships between the
    different players in the Big Data farming stakeholder network. The current development
    stage does however not reveal yet towards which main scenario Smart Farming will
    be developed. What challenges need to be addressed in relation to the previous
    questions? A long list of key issues was already provided in Table 4, but the
    most important ones are • Data-ownership and related privacy and security issues
    – these issues have to be properly addressed, but when this is applied too strictly
    it can also slow down innovations; • Data quality – which has always been a key
    issue in farm management information systems, but is more challenging with big,
    real-time data; • Intelligent processing and analytics – for Big Data this is
    also more challenging because of the large amount of often unstructured, heterogeneous
    data which requires a smart interplay between skilled data scientists and domain
    experts; • Sustainable integration of Big Data sources – integration of many different
    data sources is challenging but because this is crucial for your business model
    this has to be done in a sustainable manner; • Business models that are attractive
    enough for solution providers but that also enable a fair share between the different
    stakeholders; • Openness of platforms that will accelerate solution development
    and innovation in general but also empower farmers in their position in supply
    chains. The framework for analysis was developed from a chain network perspective
    with specific attention to network management between the stakeholders that are
    involved. In future research it could also be valuable to look at this subject
    from a wider innovation perspective (Busse et al., 2015, Klerkx et al., 2010,
    Lamprinopoulou et al., 2014). The same holds for ethical aspects of an innovation
    such as Big Data that could be addressed in future research (Carolan, 2016, Driessen
    and Heutinck, 2015, Wigboldus et al., 2016). The promise of Big Data in agriculture
    is alluring, but the challenges above have to be addressed for increased uptake
    of Big Data applications. Although there are certainly technical issues to be
    resolved we recommend to focus first on the governance issues that were identified
    and design suitable business models because these are currently the most inhibiting
    factors. References AgGateway, 2014 AgGateway Data privacy and use white paper

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n2 of 18\n\
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\

    \ components that facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data. \n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse \nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as \nweather and climate data. The collected data from these\
    \ different sources can be in differ-\nent formats that are not compatible to\
    \ be stored in a unique database. In addition, some \ncollected data may contain\
    \ incomplete data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous \ninstances [26].\
    \ To address these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices for\
    \ \ndata preprocessing can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These\
    \ practices in-\nclude standardizing data to a predefined format, identifying\
    \ and deleting duplicated data, \nhandling the gaps in generated data, and validating\
    \ data sources and contents. Addition-\nally, the collected data from different\
    \ sources can be stored in a common infrastructure \nand can be integrated with\
    \ other data sources that are collected from diverse smart farm-\ning systems.\
    \ These methods assist in ensuring data consistency, completeness [27], and \n\
    accuracy [28]. The components in the second and the third layers are highly correlated,\
    \ \nand many of the smart farming data processing functions can be assigned to\
    \ both layers. \nThe data processing layer components are the brains of smart\
    \ farming [29]. Mathematical \nmodeling, statistical methods, or AI methods are\

    \ that facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data.\nThe decision-making\
    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 838\n7 of 18\nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend\
    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\
    \ to provide compatibility among different compo-\nnents of the platform; real-time\
    \ processing to generate fast and accurate information for\ndecision making; scalability\
    \ that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources;\nreliability\
    \ to assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy\
    \ to\npreserve the system safety and conﬁdentiality; and, ﬁnally compliance with\
    \ the related\npolicies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisﬁes\
    \ all these requirements\ncan enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase\
    \ productivity, proﬁtability, and\nperformance while decreasing resource waste.\n\
    \ \nbuild trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that\
    \ mandate the rights \nand responsibilities of different actors in smart farming\
    \ systems. There is also the need to \nset standards for data-sharing practices\
    \ and to apply policies to determine accountability \nand penalties in the case\
    \ of possible disputes. Other regulations related to food safety, \nsupply chain\
    \ management, disease monitoring, and other applications can also impact \nagriculture\
    \ data management and processing. These policies can be renewed to be appli-\n\
    cable to new and emerging agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements\
    \ can be \nembedded into technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability\
    \ purposes. \nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend consideration\
    \ of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for smart farming\
    \ data processing. These \nrequirements enable seamless integration of data, system,\
    \ and processes with the end-\nuser in mind. They include interoperability to\

    \ and \nprivacy to preserve the system safety and confidentiality; and, finally\
    \ compliance with the \nrelated policies and regulations in smart farming. A platform\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    Standardization in the field of agro-geoinformation is imperative to support and
    simplify the sharing, usage and interoperability of agro-geoinformation of different
    sources. It is also a complex task that addresses multiple aspects encompassing
    data collection, data analysis, data management, system development, data sharing
    and information service. As such, a reference model is required to achieve this
    task in an integrated and consistent manner. The reference model for agro-geoinformation
    standards defined aim, emphasis, groups of standards and their relation. Using
    methods of system engineering and conceptual schema, this paper developed and
    brought forward a reference model for agro-geoinformation standards. The reference
    model consists of three levels - the base standard level, the general standard
    level, the profile and application standard level. The general standard consists
    of five groups including guidance standards, data or product standards, management
    standards, application system development standards and information service standards.
    The paper mainly set forth the standard composition and essentials of five groups.
    It put forward important principles and methods for building specific agricultural
    information standard profiles and application standards based on the base standard
    and the general standard. The reference model has guidance meaning for the field
    information standardization which focuses on information accumulation, application
    and service as well as establishment of agro-geoinformation standard system. Published

    IEEE Conference Location: Shanghai, China SECTION I. Introduction With the development
    of agricultural information construction and the wide application of information
    technology, higher requirements have put forward for effective, comprehensive
    and standards agricultural geographic information. It has become development trend
    to set up specialized, standard and shared data collection system, treatment system,
    management system and service system for agro-geoinformation. However, due to
    lack of standards, a large number of agricultural geographic information could
    only be used in internal information system. In order to improve data use efficiency,
    agro-geoinformation standard system was required to ensure interoperability and
    sharing of agro-geoinformation. Since multiple standards worked together to achieve
    the same purpose, the goal, methods as well as standard relationships for agro-geoinformation
    standardization should be put forward. Reference model for agro-geoinformation
    standard could do it. The reference model defines the framework of agro-geoinformation
    standardization, the relationship between standards and its contents. It is the
    basis of the standard system to guide the work of agro-geoinformation standardization.
    SECTION II. Progress of reference model for geographic information standards Agro-geoinformation
    belongs to the scope of geographic information. Therefore, it is important to
    understand the reference model for geographic information standard in order to
    develop the reference model for agro-geoinformation standard. According to the
    different levels of regional, association and international, the reference model
    for geographic information standard included “Geographic information - Reference
    model” by Geographic Information Technical Committee of European Committee for
    Standardization (CEN/TC 287) (1996)[1], “OGC Reference Model” by Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) (2003)[2] and ISO 19101–2002 “Geographic information - Reference
    model” by Geographic information/Geomatics of International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO/TC 211) (2002)[3]. Those reference models proposed frameworks for geographic
    information standards. Because of difference on publishing time, the goal for
    standardization as well as technology development and limitations of human cognitive,
    the contents of those reference models were a large of differences. By using conceptual
    modeling method, CEN/TC 287 reference model presented two category standards-geographic
    data and service. Geographic data standards included semantic aspects, spatial
    aspects, quality aspects and metadata. The service standards included query and
    update service, transfer service. Based on analysis of geographic information
    sharing and interoperability from viewpoints of enterprise, information, computation,
    engineering and technology, OGC reference model developed five level standards.
    The enterprise viewpoint described geographic information business perspective,
    purpose scope and policies. The information viewpoint was concerned with the semantics
    of information and information processing. The computational viewpoint was concerned
    with the functional decomposition of the system into a set of services that interact
    at interfaces. The engineering viewpoint related to specific components linked
    by a communications network. The technology viewpoint was concerned with the underlying
    infrastructure in a distributed system. OGC reference model was by far the most
    comprehensive reference model for geographic information standards. The reference
    model of ISO 19101 by ISO/TC 211grouped five major areas of standards-the framework
    and reference model, data models and operators, data administration, geographic
    information services, profiles and functional standards. The frame work and reference
    model covered more general aspects of ISO geographic standard series. Data models
    and operators were concerned with the underlying spatial geometry and how geographic
    features and their spatial characteristics could be modeled. Data administration
    was concerned with description of quality principles and evaluation procedures
    for geographic information including cataloguing, reference by coordinate or geographic
    identifier and metadata. Geographic information services defined the encoding
    of information in transfer formats and the methodology for presentation based
    on cartography. This area also included the satellite positioning. Profiles and
    functional standards considered the technique of profiling. ISO 19101 was developed
    by the joint participation of experts from countries. But it mainly focused on
    standards of the information viewpoint and the computational viewpoint. With reference
    models for geographic information standard publishing successively overseas, China
    started to pay attention to develop relevant reference models. Some of national
    projects on spatial infrastructure and database development had adopted concepts
    from ISO 19101 to organize, manage and develop project standards. For example,
    “Digital Land Project (2003)” by the Ministry of Land and Resources developed
    “Reference Model for Information of Land and Resources”[4]. “Scientific Data Sharing
    Project” (2003) by the Ministry of Science and Technology developed “Standards
    Framework and Reference Model”[5]. In 2007 and 2008, the National Geographic Information
    Standardization Technical Committee (SAC/TC 230) presented official files on “Standard
    System Framework for Geographic Information”[6] and “National Standard System
    for Geographic Information”[7]. Those provided guidelines for promote development
    of geographic information standard in China. SECTION III. Framework and content
    of reference model for agro-geoinformation standards A. Goals and emphasis of
    agro-geoinformation standardization The goal of agro-geoinformation standardization
    is to achieve the best efficiency in agro-geoinformation production, management,
    applications and services across the different application fields and disciplines,
    to achieve data integration, sharing and interoperability, to achieve information
    services cross different platforms and systems. The standards focus on the combination
    of information technology and agro-geoinformation. B. Standard levels classification
    The framework of reference model for agro-geoinformation standards was proposed
    by learning ideas of the reference model for geographic information standardization.
    Through the analysis of characteristics of agro-geoinformation as well as processes
    from data acquisition, analysis, management and service[8]–[12]. The framework
    of standards was divided into three levels-the base standard level, the general
    standard level, the profile and application standard level (Figure 1). Figure
    1. Framework for agro-geoinformation standards Show All The standards in base
    level were used to guide development of agro-geoinformation standards and specifications.
    They included national standards on geographic information, remote sensing and
    information technology, agriculture industry standards and industry standards
    of other areas. The standards in general level were concerned with generic set
    of agro-geoinformation standards on the basis of the base standard level. It included
    five groups on guidance standards, data or product standards, management standards,
    application system development standards and information service standards. The
    general standard level had roles for control and restriction of the profile and
    application standard level and could be implemented in the lower level. When necessary,
    the lower application standard level could be extended for the specific application
    requirements without conflict the principles of the upper general standard level.
    The profile and application standard level was developed on the basis of the base
    standard level and the general standard level, which proposed relevant standards
    and specification for disciplines and projects, such as standards on remote sensing
    for agriculture, standards on digital soil, and so on. C. The general standard
    level 1) Guidance standards The guidance standards for agro-geoinformation standardization
    described requirements, concept, composition and mutual relations, as well as
    the basic principles and methods of use. The guidance standards included standard
    system, reference model, terminology, conformance and testing and profile. Although
    these standards were not specific implement standards, they were the basis for
    the standard development and coordination. a) Reference model or standard system
    for agro-geoinformation standardization Reference model described the goal of
    agro-geoinformation standardization, relevant concepts, the standard framework
    and its relationship. The standard system was the list of standards according
    to their relation intrinsically within a certain range[13]. The standard system
    for agro-geoinformation was formed based on the reference model. Standard names
    were listed in accordance with hierarchy structure of general standards and specific
    standards. The standard system could provide references for the department of
    agro-geoinformation standardization in charge to develop standard policies. b)
    Terminology on agro-geoinformation Terminology definition and reference on agro-geoinformation
    was a bit of confusing at present. The same term had different definition in different
    standards, which affected the expression, storage and exchange of agro-geoinformation.
    There was an urgent need for the term unified to eliminate ambiguity. The terminology
    standard on agro-geoinformation was concerned with criteria and conditions for
    the term selection, definition record structure, semantic representation and its
    source. The role of the standard was to guarantee uniform agro-geoinformation
    expression consistency from the concept. c) Conformance and testing The standard
    on conformance and testing for agro-geoinformation provided framework, concepts
    and methodology for testing data or software product or service or by specifications
    and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance to relevant agro-geoinformation
    standards. It provided a framework for specifying abstract test suites and defining
    the procedures to be followed during conformance testing. This standard could
    be used with the profile standard to judge consistency between agro-geoinformation
    standards and the external standards. d) the profile for agro-geoinformation Base
    standards and general standards have provided foundation and guide for application
    standards. But different communities had different requirements for the extent
    they want to use or implement these standards. It needed clearly identification
    and documentation of specific subsets of the base and general standards in a prescribed
    manner in conformance with these standards profiles. The profile was set of one
    or more base standards or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable, the
    identification of chosen clauses, classes, options and parameters of those base
    standards, that were necessary for accomplishing a particular function[14]. Profiles
    for agro-geoinformation defined conformance relationship between profiles and
    base standards, how profiles referenced base standards. 2) Data or product standards
    These standards specified data or product content, acquisition, processing, storage
    and maintenance for agro-geoinformation. a) Classification and encoding for agro-geoinformation
    Agro-geoinformation is information concerning phenomena implicitly or explicitly
    associated with a location relative to agriculture. It includes agriculture natural
    information such as water, soil, climate resources, crop resources and economy
    information such as population of rural areas, labor force and agricultural production.
    It also includes remote sensing images such as satellite images, aerial photos
    and interpreting graphics. The standards of classification and encoding defined
    contents, classification and encoding of agricultural spatial dataset through
    analysis of data sources, processing, products and applications. b) Data element
    expression for agro-geoinformation The data element is a set of attributes to
    describe the data definition, identification, representation and domain of the
    data unit[15]. Its proposes was to clearly understand data meaning, representation
    and identification between users and owners in order to exchange data easily and
    share in different application environments, such as data elements for agro-meteorological
    information, soil information, et al. Data elements could be divided into general
    data elements and application data elements. General data elements was independent
    any specific application. It provided a general data element dictionary. Such
    as, soil data element was a general data element dictionary[16], the data elements
    for the national second soil survey data was an application data element. c) Data
    dictionary for agro-geoinformation The data dictionary is a collection of non-application
    data in database. They are organized according to a certain pattern and managed
    regularity by using computer to establish database about database. The data dictionary
    could be used for data management, maintenance, sharing, distribution and services.
    The database or data files included vector data, raster data, text data, data
    on audio and video. Based on different description object, the data dictionary
    could be divided into the database dictionary and feature dictionary. d) Feature
    cataloging for agro-geoinformation Geographic feature is abstraction of real world
    phenomena[17]. Agro-geoinformation feature was abstraction of agricultural phenomena
    related to the location on earth. The feature catalogue defined feature type,
    feature attribute, feature operation and its relation to make common understanding
    between user and owner in order to promote agro-geoinformation distribution, sharing
    and usage. e) Metadata for agro-geoinformation Due to data confidentiality or
    paid-sharing factors, some agro-geoinformation was not public free use. But metadata
    about database was free on internet. Metadata is data about data[18]. It used
    to describe the contents, coverage range, spatial referencing, data quality, data
    owner and so on. It provided a way of searching datasets through internet. There
    were several standards about metadata, such as GB/T 19710–2005 “Geographic information
    - Metadata”[19], ISO 19115–2-2010 “Geographic information - Metadata-images and
    grid data”[20]. It was necessary to develop metadata for agro-geoinformation satisfied
    to the requirement of agricultural application information system. Metadata for
    agro-geoinformation described the content and structure of metadata elements of
    datasets and its extension mechanisms. f) Data acquisition standard for agro-geoinformation
    There were several methods of data acquisition, such as methods from network,
    surveying, research, interview, exchange and querying. Different methods could
    get different data types and had different data quality requirements. Data acquisition
    standard mainly described technical indicator requirement for data acquisition
    environment, methods, data processing and precision of results. g) Standard for
    agro-geoinformation updating The standard mainly specified principles, requirements,
    environment, methods, processes and accuracy requirements for agro-geoinformation
    data update. h) Specification of data product Data products for agro-geoinformation
    included spatial data products of vector, raster and images, such as soil maps,
    crop suitability assessment maps and MODIS images. They also included attribute
    data products, such as observation data from meteorological stations, information
    system software and hardware such as grassland management information systems,
    soil moisture meter and so on. The specification of data products mainly defined
    requirements for data products identification, content, structure, reference coordination,
    data quality, data acquisition, data maintenance and graphic expression. It was
    the basis for the work of producer and valuable for user to select, purchase and
    use agro-geoinformation data products. 3) Management standards a) Specification
    for data security Data security included data confidentiality, integrity, identification
    and authorization. The specification mainly presented data security and privacy
    regulations required at the systems of the core layer, the internal layer and
    the external layer in order to get a wider range of application. b) Quality control
    for agro-geoinformation The standards described data quality control requirement
    for quantitative elements and non-quantitative elements of data collection, management,
    sharing, services and evaluation processing. Components of quantity element included
    data completeness, logical consistency, positional accuracy, temporal accuracy
    and thematic accuracy[21]. Components of non-quantity element included data purpose,
    usage and lineage. Data quality evaluation procedure included methodology for
    data quality measures, such as direct and indirect evaluation, and quality information
    report[22]. c) Testing for software or products The testing purpose was to verify
    whether software or products met quality requirements of the system design, product
    specification and related standards in order to find errors or defects. Testing
    standards for agro-geoinformation system or products concerned with testing technical
    requirements related to spatial data processing and product services. It could
    be developed referenced to GB/T 15532-2008 “Specification for Computer Software
    Test”[23] and GB/T 19333.5–2003 “Geographic information - Conformance and testing”[24].
    It specified testing category, procedures, methods, documentation and testing
    tool selection. d) Storage and archiving of agro-geoinformation The forms of agro-geoinformation
    storage and archiving included electronic documents and materials in paper form.
    Electronic documents referred to files and database generated from the digital
    equipment, stored on tape, disk, CD-ROM carrier in digital form. They depended
    on computers and other digital devices to read and process[25]. Specification
    of storage and archiving was concerned with technical requirements about rules
    and methods for data organization, naming, compression, restoration, storage and
    backup. 4) Standards for application system development a) Specifications for
    design of agro-geoinformation application softwares With the development of agricultural
    information technology, a number of agro-geoinformation software appeared, such
    as the real-time field data acquisition system for grassland, agricultural status
    monitoring system by remote sensing. However, due to lack of specifications for
    software design, the software system had the low level of efficiency and poor
    repeat use. So it was necessary to establish specifications of software system
    design for all aspects of information collection and decision-making processing.
    Specifications for agricultural information application software design could
    be developed based on the information technology specification. The main contents
    should include software requirements, design, construction, testing, maintenance,
    configuration management and so on. b) Specifications for agro-geoinformation
    system development From the perspective of system design and development, specifications
    for agro-geoinformation system development specified process of system development,
    defined system functions. The main contents include specification for the project
    organization and management, requirements for system construction process, requirements
    for system platform and system functions. c) Specifications for agro-geoinformation
    development on network It is the trend to develop public agro-geoinformation technology
    platform on network. For example, the wireless sensor network technology could
    meet the need for precision agriculture information systems. Specifications for
    agro-geoinformation development on network mainly concerned with the basic process,
    internetworking (such as network structure and topology, standards for network
    access equipment, network interconnection agreement, protocol), LAN network construction,
    IP address and requirements for acceptance testing. d) Database development for
    agro-geoinformation There have been a large number of agro-geoinformation databases.
    Since there was no unified database structure and data description standards,
    the structure of feature and attribute description were varied, which affected
    data sharing and interoperation. Therefore, it was necessary to develop standards
    on database. Standards referred to description of feature structure for spatial
    data and attribute structure description. e) Specification on equipment requirements
    for agro-geo information The specifications were concerned with technical indicator
    requirements for ago-geoinformation data acquisition, processing, service, storage
    and backup related to computer network equipment, communications as well as equipment
    testing, such as specification for wireless sensor network technology for precision
    agriculture, standard of the general bus for agricultural machinery. 5) Standards
    for information services a) Positioning services for agro-geoinformation Positioning
    services provided information on location, observation accuracy through a variety
    use of techniques. For example, precision agriculture system could implement a
    set of modern farming technology on positioning, timing and quantity based on
    spatial variability. Precision agriculture used global positioning system (GPS)
    for information acquisition and accurate positioning. Intelligent agricultural
    machinery with GPS could control precision seeding, fertilizing, spraying automatically.
    Standards on positioning service specified data structures and operations required
    by positioning services interface as well as location-based services, so that
    spatial-oriented systems (such as GIS) could make more effective use of these
    technologies to achieve a variety of positioning technologies interoperability.
    b) Web Services on agro-geoinformation With the increasing requirement for agro-geoinformation
    sharing, how to make users to find and use those data effectively was an issue
    to face. We could learn from FGDC geographic information exchange center established
    by USA to set up metadata-based information distribution service system to promote
    agro-geoinformation data sharing through network directory service, format conversion
    services, web registration services and map services. Standards on web service
    described those services. c) Data interface and exchange for agro-geo information
    Agro-geoinformation data types included spatial data and attribute data. Exchange
    format for attribute data was relatively simpler than spatial data. As spatial
    data distributed at different departments, spatial data storage structure was
    different. Such as, some spatial data stored in ARCINFO Shape file format, some
    in DXF format. Data sharing and interoperability became issues. China has published
    GB/T 17798–2007 “Geospatial Data Interchange Format”, which specified vector and
    raster data exchange format applicable to interchange of vector data, image, grid
    data and digital elevation model (DEM)[26]. ISO/TC 211 introduced GML (Geography
    Markup Language) to be the basis for set up open geodata interoperability platform[27].
    The spatial data exchange and sharing for agro-geoinformation between nodes under
    the network environment could take GML-based multi-source heterogeneous spatial
    data exchange model to implement heterogeneous spatial data exchange. So it needed
    to develop standards on agro-geoinformation data model, interchange format and
    technology to implement spatial data exchange and sharing through network. d)
    Portrayal on agro-geoinformation Different application system had different digital
    map display standard, such as graphic expression on crop sown area distribution
    map was different with grassland desertification monitoring map. The standard
    of portrayal on agro-geoinformation was concerned with defining a map expression
    schema, map expression director package for feature types, portrayal specification
    with parameters required by express services. The standards should also provide
    classification of element symbols, size, positioning point symbols and positioning
    lines, graphic symbol color, annotation and other contents. e) Specifications
    of data sharing and publishing on agro-geoinformation Some agro-geoinformation
    data could be shared freely to the public. But a considerable portion of data
    related to intellectual property rights and copyright needed to set permissions
    and provided paid services. Specifications of data sharing and publishing on agro-geoinformation
    specified data sharing classification, the provisions of data sharing service
    object type and permissions, channels for data sharing and requirements for data
    publish in order to ensure data wide used. SECTION IV. Implement mechanism for
    profile to agro-geoinformation standardization A. Implementation mechanism The
    base standards and the general standards provided technical requirements, processes
    and models for agro-geoinformation and application system development. Some of
    standards were creating elements; others were introducing structures and rules.
    Different agricultural application fields had different requirements for the extent
    they wanted to use or implemented these elements and rules. Profiles could promote
    integration of base standards by defining how to use a combination of base standards
    for a given functional environment. Some profiles could be developed based on
    the rules defined by the base standards. Some profiles could select relevant contents
    or elements directly from the base standards particular to the special application.
    These profiles developed in accordance with profile mechanism and could ensure
    conformance with the base standards. To ensure for the control and restriction,
    profiles should be developed in accordance with the rules of profiling. Mandatory
    requirements in base standards remained mandatory in the profile. Optional requirements
    in base standards could be mandatory, condition or option to suit the implementation
    in the profile. The profile should include contents on claiming conformance to
    the base and general standards. It also should define requirements satisfied any
    implementation consistent to the profile. Through the conformance abstract test
    suite, the profile could be tested to satisfy all the conformance requirements
    with the base standards so as to ensure the consistency of agro-geoinformation
    profiles with base standards. B. An application example GB/T 19710–2005 “Geographic
    Information-Metadata” described over 400 mandatory, conditional and optional metadata
    elements, as well as core metadata elements for geographic information dataset[19].
    To the field of agro-geoinformation, such as grassland resource information, metadata
    elements could be formed selecting metadata elements from GB/T 19710, combined
    with its own data characteristics, constituted a metadata elements suitable for
    grassland resource information, such as NY/T 1171–2006 “Metadata for grassland
    resource information[28]. NY/T 1171 reduced a lot of unsuitable metadata elements
    unsuitable to describe grassland resources information (Figure 2). Figure 2. Example
    of profile for grassland resources information metadata Show All SECTION V. Conclusion
    The reference model for agro-geoinformation provided a new idea for the construction
    of the standard system. It defined three standard levels and five groups of the
    general standards. It also put forward important principles and methods for building
    specific agricultural information standard profiles and application standards
    based on base standard and general standard. The purpose was to enhance the coordination
    between standards to achieve the best overall effectiveness and promote the integration
    and sharing of agro-geoinformation. The reference model had guidance meaning for
    agro-geoinformation standardization which focused on information accumulation,
    application and service. Acknowledgement Supported by National Basic Research

    Abstract\nAccording to the United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals are framed\
    \ for improving rural health, hunger, poverty \nissues, environmental conditions,\
    \ and illiteracy globally. With the upcoming technology, there have been many\
    \ advances \nin the lifestyle of people all around the world. Comparatively, more\
    \ emphasis has been given to the development of urban \nareas than rural. The\
    \ sustainable development of a country depends on the growth of its rural areas.\
    \ Countless technologi-\ncal and theoretical models, projects, and frameworks\
    \ have been proposed and implemented to help overcome sundry issues \nand challenges\
    \ faced by rural people in quotidian life. New technological methods are deemed\
    \ to be the future of livability, \ntherefore; a technologically advanced solution\
    \ for sustainable rural development is called for. Blockchain Technology is the\
    \ \nnext step for innovation and development and it has far many applications\
    \ in sustainable rural development that are yet to \nbe discovered. The objective\
    \ of this paper is to explicitly review research conducted in rural development\
    \ to fill the undone \nwork in the future with better research ideas, to make\
    \ rural areas a livable and advanced place while also maintaining their \nintegrity\
    \ leading to sustainable development. To conduct such a review, a systematic research\

    \ of a country partly depends on how well \nconnected are its rural areas to the\
    \ global chain and how \ntechnologically advanced they are. Rural areas as we\
    \ know \nof are geographical locations sited outside town or cities \nwith fewer\
    \ populations. Essentially, we also know it as a \nplace unprivileged of vital\
    \ necessities, stricken by poverty \n[1], and unemployment. For many years, rural\
    \ areas have \nbeen developing consecutively in Technology, Education, \nHousing,\
    \ Governance, Human rights. Accordingly, the \nworld’s rural population has dropped\
    \ from 66.389 percent \nin 1960–44.286 [2] percent in 2019 due to various trans-\n\
    formations. Years ago, people in rural areas were deprived \nof necessities such\
    \ as water, electricity, and education. \nEven getting a reliable source of electricity\
    \ was a strenuous \neffort. Moreover, female rights, reliable healthcare and sub-\n\
    sequently securing a job were more of a dream. According \nto the United Nations,\
    \ there can be seen a steady drop in \nthe percentage of people residing in rural\
    \ areas from 1960 \nto 2019 [3]. What was the core reason behind it? A general\
    \ \nexample of the reason can be migration, rural decline, demo-\ngraphic qualities,\
    \ natural disasters, and infrastructure: trans-\nportation or socio-economic.\
    \ These can further be exploited \ninto many explanations as to what leads to\
    \ those choices. \nRural–Urban migration itself directs catastrophic changes \n\
    in the environment and economy. Rural Decline is another \nconsequence of migration\
    \ that drains the area of services, \nbusinesses, and social capital forcing the\
    \ development of the \nFig. 1  Issues in rural areas\n2419\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ or probably diminish [4]. Even then, almost \nhalf of the world’s population\
    \ comes under rural areas and it \nconsists of many more issues than resolvable.\n\
    1.1  Background\nThis section explores the interdependent backdrops of the \n\
    rural area and a feasible solution through the concept of \nsmart villages. Sustainable\
    \ development goals with respect \nto Blockchain Technology are discussed in sub-Sect. 1.1.2\
    \ \nand a brief introduction on Blockchain Technology and \ndevelopment techniques\
    \ are mentioned in sub-Sect. 1.1.3.\n1.1.1  Rural Development\nSustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) were framed for \nimproving rural health, hunger, poverty issues,\
    \ environ-\nmental conditions, and illiteracy globally. The present situ-\nation\
    \ of rural areas brings us to a list of issues (Fig. 1) that \ncan further promote\
    \ the eradication of rural areas from the \nglobal chain if not technologically.\
    \ Beginning with pov-\nerty which has been an issue unresolved regardless of the\
    \ \nvarious monetary schemes provided by the government \ndrives the young generation\
    \ out of the community to find \njobs to sustain daily needs. Many of them fail\
    \ to finish \neven high school, which leads to securing menial jobs in \nurban\
    \ regions. This brings us to the second issue in the \nrural community, illiteracy\
    \ [5]. Education that plays a vital \nrole in the overall development of humans,\
    \ as well as the \ncommunity, is often disregarded to fulfill contemporary \n\
    requirements such as money. In many cases, the parents \nexploit their children\
    \ into working on the farm or small \nfamily businesses.\nTypical issues in a\
    \ rural school can be enumerated as \nteacher’s absenteeism, unhygienic school\
    \ premises, and dis-\ntant schools, technologically backward, absence of school\
    \ \nrecords, inexperienced teachers, and teachers with false \ndegrees. Those\
    \ who get themselves educated, consider it \nbetter to get a job in urban areas\
    \ because of job opportunities \nand better pay which is at times difficult since\
    \ most villages \nlack communication between employees and job availability \n\
    [6]. Basic hygiene and pollution are other issues in rural \nareas that deplete\
    \ life expectancy and give birth to numer-\nous diseases. Many rural communities\
    \ do not have proper \nsanitation facilities, dumping grounds, or recycling plants.\
    \ \nNot having the basic facilities drives people into a lack of \npersonal hygiene\
    \ such as bathing, washing, and cleanliness \n[7]. Pollution of land and soil\
    \ is prevalent due to unhealthy \nsanitary practices. Hundreds of people still\
    \ live without \nwashing their hands leading to diarrhea, cholera, and the \n\
    death of children [8]. Acknowledging the fact that medical \npractitioners, physicians\
    \ are scarce on top of that reaching \na nearby multispecialty hospital takes\
    \ a lot of time [9]. The \nprimary activity of rural people is said to be agriculture.\
    \ \nIt is considered to be the basic source of income for the \ndwellers. Farmers\
    \ in many areas remain uninformed about \nthe recent advancements in agro-technologies.\
    \ The core \nreason for this incomprehension is the lack of broadband \nconnection\
    \ and incentives. Even though the Government \nprovides various monetary as well\
    \ as agricultural schemes, \nmore than half of the farmers fail to enroll in one\
    \ [10]. In \naddition to that from the consumer’s point, there is a whole \nheap\
    \ of issues relating to the certification of quality produce, \nimproper monitoring\
    \ of crops, traceability of farm produce, \nand unsustainable agro-activities.\
    \ Besides, the involvement \nof middlemen leaves the farmers with the minimal\
    \ price \nof agricultural produce [11]. Further, given the aspects of \ndaily\
    \ needs, approximately 940 million [12] people around \nthe world live without\
    \ access to electricity, most of which \nbelong to rural areas. In a generation\
    \ where electricity is \nthe basic need in every household, industry, medical\
    \ center \nwithout which the whole institution of Earth would come \nto a halt,\
    \ there are still people who do their daily activi-\nties without it [8, 9]. About\
    \ 1.7 billion [13] people in the \nworld are still unbanked. The banking facility\
    \ is essential \nfor financial assistance especially much needed to financially\
    \ \nexcluded dwellers of the rural community. However, due \nto unreachable banking\
    \ locations, time-consuming Banking \nprocesses, and in many cases lacking identity\
    \ proof con-\nstrains the adults from applying for a bank account further \nreducing\
    \ the chances of obtaining a loan or funding from \ngovernment schemes [14].\n\
    The concept of a smart village [15] is to develop a rural \narea using technology\
    \ as a medium. The biggest problems \nin rural areas are financial exclusion,\
    \ poverty, hygiene, and \neducation [16]. All the issues are interconnected and\
    \ co-\ndependent, such as due to poverty, children in rural areas fail \nto get\
    \ an education [17]. Due to illiteracy, the villagers do \nnot come to know about\
    \ various financial schemes. People \nseem to care very less about hygiene. Not\
    \ only the waste \nis disposed of incorrectly, but it is also burnt giving rise\
    \ to \nenvironmental pollution. Most of the time people do not \nfind encouragement\
    \ to learn how to properly discard waste \nmaterial, to get educated, or find\
    \ a solution to their financial \nproblems [18].\n1.1.2  Sustainable Development\
    \ and Blockchain\nThe development of an economically backward area without \n\
    jeopardizing the natural assets or future necessities is termed \nsustainable\
    \ development. According to the United Nations, \nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDG) [19] were adopted \nin 2015 for improving rural health, hunger, poverty\
    \ issues, \nenvironmental conditions, and illiteracy globally (Fig. 2). \nThe\
    \ sustainable development goals that balance the socio-\neconomic and environmental\
    \ factors are:\n2420\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nFor rural development, World\

    \ \ncommercialization, and agriculture business, agricultural \nextension, research,\
    \ and many other support activities \nalong with social protection and transportation\

    \ smart vil-\nlage is an approach to empowering underserved communi-\nties, providing\
    \ the power, education, entrepreneur oppor-\ntunities. Following are the project\

    \ consumers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, \nIndia [21].\nChallenges of achieving Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals \n(SG’s) in rural areas can be elucidated in terms of different\
    \ \nregions. As per the research [22], in Ukraine, control over \nthe large businesses\
    \ and their impact over the agribusiness \nstructures in addition to shrinking\
    \ the number of farms, \njeopardizing rural population, poverty, and fewer efforts\
    \ in \nsocial cohesion improvements or remote development are \nthe principal\
    \ challenges of achieving SDG.\nSimilarly, as per the methodology applied by the\
    \ author in \n[23], the major challenges faced by Romania over achieving \nSDG\
    \ are the Socio economic discrepancy among the rural \ndwellers’ lives as well\
    \ as the Environmental incongruity.\nA few of the Sustainable Development challenges\
    \ faced \nby the Iranian Rural communities as per the authors [24] \nare economic\
    \ setbacks, improper management, and under-\nplanned developments, environmental\
    \ factors, social con-\ncerns, and infrastructural challenges were determined.\
    \ \nOverall implications of the studies provide us with a con-\ncise picture of\
    \ significant challenges of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment goals in rural\
    \ areas.\nSustainability and blockchain both are the call for the \nfuture to\
    \ reduce cost, increase productivity, improving \nhealth, better environmental\
    \ state, and availability of food, \nwater, and sanitation. Blockchain holds the\
    \ ability for long-\nterm and inclusive progress in sustainable development and\
    \ \nto achieve SDGs.\n1.1.3  Blockchain Technology\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto\
    \ [25] (pseudonym) proposed \nBitcoin, its expansion was doubted. The rise of\
    \ Blockchain \nwas such unforeseen that some enthusiasts asserted it as the \n\
    biggest invention since the Internet [26]. Although W Scott \nStornetta and Stuart\
    \ Haber described the first cryptographi-\ncally secured chain of blocks in 1991,\
    \ it wasn’t until 2009 \nthat Blockchain was implemented as the public ledger\
    \ for \nbitcoin transactions by Nakamoto. For a substantial amount \nof time,\
    \ Blockchain technology was only preferred for a \ncryptocurrency (Fig. 3). However,\
    \ after the introduction of \nscripting language into the blocks by Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ \nto work as bonds, which are now known as Smart Contracts \nthe inventory of\
    \ applications widely opened. In his paper \nNakamoto proposed to create a peer-to-peer\
    \ form of elec-\ntronic cash that did not require a financial institution as an\
    \ \nintermediary and would be transferred directly between \none party and another.\
    \ He improved the double-spending \nFig. 2  Sustainable development \ngoals\n\
    2421\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages\
    \ \n1 3\nproblem in Digital Signatures by implementing timestamps \non the transaction\
    \ and hashing them onto the ongoing chain \nof hash-based proof-of-work which\
    \ changed the proof-of-\nwork if tampered with hence forming an immutable record.\n\
    Blockchain, even though it uses pseudonyms as account \nidentifiers, has four\
    \ key trust characteristics that eliminate \nthe need for third-party authenticators.\
    \ Firstly, a ledger in \nwhich after successful verification and authentication\
    \ the \ntransaction details are stored. Secondly, it is Secure since \nits transactions\
    \ are time-stamped and hashed to the previ-\nous blocks; it makes the blockchain\
    \ cryptographically secure \n(Fig. 4). Thirdly, the shared characteristic of involving\
    \ mul-\ntiple users provides transparency amongst all participants \nin the distributed\
    \ ledger. Lastly, its property of being dis-\ntributed eliminates operational\
    \ inefficiencies, provides more \nsecurity as the more the number of nodes the\
    \ more resilient \nit is towards attacks [27].\nThe complexity of the working\
    \ of blockchain can be \nsimplified by exploring the components that make up its\
    \ \narchitecture [28]. The main components can be enumer-\nated as Node, Cryptographic\
    \ hash functions, Transactions, \nAsymmetric-key cryptography, Ledgers, Blocks,\
    \ Miners, \nand Consensus (Fig. 5).\nNode: A device possibly a computer forming\
    \ the structure \nof a blockchain. A node is where the blockchain exists. Cop-\n\
    ies, as well as original records of the blockchain, are stored \nin a node. Classified\
    \ as Full node and Light nodes, where \nFull node is a server in a decentralized\
    \ network that contains \nthe Block chain’s block history, and Light nodes are\
    \ used for \nsimple payment verification such as a wallet that queries the \n\
    current status of a block.\nLedgers: A decentralized blockchain uses a ledger\
    \ for \nrecord-keeping. As it is decentralized, it keeps many copies \nof the\
    \ transaction including providing a copy to each user \nof their transaction.\n\
    Blocks: A block resembles a page in a record book \n(ledger). The first block\
    \ is called the generic block. A block \ncomprises a block header and block data\
    \ where the block \nheader consists of the history of the blockchain (previous\
    \ \nhash value, timestamp, size of the block, and nonce) and \nminers perform\
    \ hashing to validate the block, and block data \nkeeps the record of recent transactions\
    \ that are yet to enter \nthe blocks.\nCryptographic hash functions: A digest\
    \ or an algorithm \nthat takes up an arbitrary amount of data and produces a \n\
    hash value or hash which is an output of fixed size. It elimi-\nnates the use\
    \ of a password, instead uses enciphered text that \nprovides more security from\
    \ attackers.\nTransactions: A transaction is what the components work \nabout.\
    \ When two parties interact in blockchain, a transaction \ntakes place. Authorization\
    \ is required to approve a transac-\ntion between two parties. In a public blockchain,\
    \ the trans-\naction is inserted by consensus which happens when the \nmajority\
    \ of nodes validate the transaction.\nAsymmetric-key cryptography: It is public-key\
    \ cryptogra-\nphy that is used to enable certitude between the transacting \n\
    parties who are unsure about each other’s integrity. Asym-\nmetric-key cryptography\
    \ uses mathematically related keys to \nensure safety as well as the secrecy of\
    \ data. The public key \nand Private key, even though relative is used for decryption\
    \ \nand encryption, respectively.\nMiners: When two users create a transaction,\
    \ the miners \nvalidate that transaction in the block data before putting it \n\
    on the ledger. The average time it takes for a miner to mine a \nblock is 10 min.\
    \ Since miners use their energy and hardware \nto solve a block, they also require\
    \ an incentive for their work \nwhich is mostly paid in cryptocurrency.\nConsensus:\
    \ A consensus can be identified as a decision-\nmaking criterion. It makes sure\
    \ that all the nodes validate a \nblock and no such duplicity exists in the ledger\
    \ that hasn’t \nbeen agreed upon. The discussion involved in consensus is \nFig.\

    \ such as smart contracts. Application development in \nblockchain can be done\
    \ through Ethereum which can also \ncall multiple other blockchain, protocols,\
    \ and cryptocurren-\ncies [30]. Ethereum uses the chain of global computers to\
    \ \noperate and runs smart contracts that are free of intermediar-\nies or third-party\
    \ censorships. Ethereum uses an incentive \nmechanism [31] to encourage programmers\
    \ who run the \nFig. 4  Blockchain technology diagram\n2423\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nEthereum functions\
    \ to compensate for hardware and energy \nused in running decentralized digital\
    \ applications (dapps). \nThese incentives are called Ether which is a cryptocurrency\
    \ \nin the Ethereum protocol.\n1.1.4  Blockchain Development Platforms and Tools\n\
    To simplify the blockchain processes and to ease the devel-\nopment various tools\
    \ and programming languages have been \nintroduced.\n1.1.4.1 Ethereum Virtual\
    \ Machine (EVM) The executing \ncode and the Executing machine consist of an abstraction\
    \ \nwhich is referred to as virtual machines, and Ethereum vir-\ntual machines\
    \ increase the intended code execution chances, \nand the consensus is maintained\
    \ on it [32].\n1.1.4.2 Remix IDE Remix Integrated Development Envi-\nronment is\
    \ open-source software for web or desktop devel-\nopment. An intuitive and appealing\
    \ interface remix allows \nsmart contract development and Ethereum interaction\
    \ [33]. \nRemix IDE has multiple plugin options such as Web3 inte-\ngration, embedded\
    \ Web3, and Javascript for running the \ncontract locally. Solidity smart contract\
    \ programming lan-\nguage is used for development in Remix IDE.\n1.1.4.3 Smart\
    \ Contracts Simple programs stored on the \nblockchain comprise some predefined\
    \ conditions [34]. \nUpon meeting the conditions the contract is self-executed\
    \ \ngiving the edge of non-intermediary processes as well as \ntime efficiency.\
    \ Multiple programming languages are used \nto develop smart contracts for blockchain;\
    \ a few of them \nhave been discussed below:\n• Solidity [35]: A highly preferred\
    \ object-oriented design-\nbased, high-level language conveniently made for \n\
    developing smart contracts. Most of the solidity syntax \ninspiration came from\
    \ C ++ , Javascript, and Python pro-\ngramming languages. Solidity, along with\
    \ being the top \nsmart contract language focusing on EVM in certain also \nsupports\
    \ inheritance and user-defined types.\n• Vyper [36]: Highly influenced by python\
    \ and the sec-\nond-best after Solidity, vyper is based on three important \n\
    principles namely auditability to ensure the readability \nand understandability\
    \ of the code for the user, Security \nto ensure secure smart contracts, and Simplicity\
    \ of the \nlanguage and the implementation.\n• Yul [37]: An intermediate smart\
    \ contract development \nlanguage that includes the bytecode compilation accord-\n\
    ing to different backend needs. The main focuses of Yul \nare simplicity in bytecode\
    \ translation, understandability, \nand readability of the scripted programs.\
    \ Yul supports \nstack machines and is specifically tailored for them, \nwhole-program\
    \ optimization, and static type reference \nand value nature.\n1.1.4.4 Hyperledger\
    \ A Linux framework for blockchain \ndevelopment that provides standards and tools\
    \ for open-\nsource blockchain applications [38]. Hyperledger enterprise \nhelps\
    \ build permissioned blockchain solutions for busi-\nnesses and services. Under\
    \ the Hyperledger Framework, \nmultiple projects have been introduced:\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric: A modular permissioned and private \nframework for blockchain technology\
    \ used for develop-\ning solutions for businesses and private enterprises. Fab-\n\
    ric has a well updated smart contract interaction, faster \ntransactions, and\
    \ efficient data sharing.\n• Hyperledger Explorer: Explorer is a user-friendly\
    \ block-\nchain development web application tool. The interface \nprovides detailed\
    \ information about the blocks, trans-\nactions, network nodes, and the state\
    \ of the blocks. \nHyperledger Explorer uses visualization tools for repre-\n\
    senting the blockchain data in a user-friendly and read-\nable manner.\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Sawtooth: By separating the core system, \nthat is, specifying the business\
    \ rules without interact-\ning with the application domain is the main task of\
    \ \nhyperledger sawtooth. It supports the Practical Byzantine \nFault Tolerance\
    \ (PBFT) as well as the Proof of Elapsed \nTime (POET). The smart contracts can\
    \ be developed and \nrun on the platform without actually knowing the core \n\
    system’s design.\nFig. 5  Blockchain components\n2424\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\n• Hyperledger Caliper: A blockchain benchmark tool, the \ncaliper used\
    \ pre-defined uses cases to test the blockchain \nsolutions along with a test\
    \ result of its performance. Cali-\nper has a very proficient success rate for\
    \ testing the suc-\ncessful and failed transactions, provides the maximum, \n\
    minimum, and average latency of transaction and read \ndata for the test cycle.\n\
    Limitations of Blockchain are limited but cannot be disre-\ngarded [39]. From\
    \ the creation of the node to the validation \nby miners, Blockchain consumes\
    \ a lot of energy. Splitting of \nthe chain is another problem where a node does\
    \ not accept \nthe transactions in a new chain if it is operating to the old \n\
    software. The computing requirements increase as the block-\nchain grows. Since\
    \ all the nodes cannot provide the neces-\nsary capacity, the node breaks, and\
    \ the immutability and \ntransparency of the blockchain cease to exist.\n1.1.5\
    \  Blockchain for Smart Village Applications\nThe scenario in a typical village\
    \ is such, in terms of the \ninfrastructure most of it is inadequately built,\
    \ there exists \nschools and colleges but poorly maintained, poorly built \nhouses\
    \ with no constraints for disaster management. In \nterms of necessities, normal\
    \ villages lack stable electricity \nsupplies, or a secure income to support electricity\
    \ bills, and \nnon-purified water. People in villages are often neglected \nand\
    \ most of the dwellers don’t have any personal or national \nidentity. The healthcare\
    \ system in villages is simple and inef-\nficient which does not help during major\
    \ problems. Normal \nvillages lack any technological advancement and people \n\
    there live in history because of the lacking development. \nSustainable development\
    \ with the concept of smart villages \ncan give a secure and feasible future to\
    \ the villages.\nBeyond the conventional use of blockchain in finance \nusing\
    \ cryptocurrency, numerous applications can change the \nway we perceive digitization.\
    \ According to Kandaswamy \n[40], blockchain can have four types of initiatives:\
    \ block-\nchain disruptor, digital asset, efficiency play, and record-\nkeeper\
    \ (Fig. 6). With similar inventiveness some of the \nblockchain applications with\
    \ the concept of a smart village \ncan be enumerated as:\nHealthcare: Blockchain\
    \ with its record-keeping charac-\nteristics and smart contract with its privacy\
    \ and security has \ngreatly assisted the medical area by providing a solution\
    \ \nfor publicly or semi-private sharing of the medical data of \npatients. This\
    \ can help the researchers and students to elicit \na new solution or use it for\
    \ clinical trials [41]. The solution \nfor missing health documents or previous\
    \ clinic visit records \ncan be improved through blockchain. The potential of\
    \ Block-\nchain to store patient’s record on the ledger make it possible \nto\
    \ get treatment across the globe. Furthermore, the problem \nof counterfeit drugs\
    \ in the market can be resolved through \nthe traceability solution from blockchain\
    \ through which fake \nmedicines can be traced and removed from the supply chain.\n\
    International payments and insurance: Accelerated pay-\nment to international\
    \ locations is possible through block-\nchain technology. Several Bitcoin-operated\
    \ services make it \neasier to transfer money cross-border. The process includes\
    \ \nconverting the payer’s local currency into Bitcoin bypass-\ning the existing\
    \ banking infrastructure and then converting \nthat Bitcoin into the receiver’s\
    \ local currency. This saves the \ntrade cost and speeds up the transaction. Apart\
    \ from that, \nthe insurance industry can also be benefitted from block-\nchain\
    \ technology [42]. Blockchain can provide a transparent \nand trustworthy system\
    \ to overcome the challenges of the \ninsurance industry. Fraudulent claims, intermediary\
    \ payment \ntransactions, and big data handling are some of the many \nissues\
    \ faced by insurance companies. Blockchain can resolve \nthe issues through its\
    \ security and transparency provided by \nthe distributed ledger which also furnishes\
    \ the authentic-\nity of the participants. Besides, its characteristic of record-\n\
    keeping comes in handy with the huge amount of customer \ndata that is immutable\
    \ in the blockchain ledger. Additionally, \nby using the smart contracts real-time\
    \ data of the claims, \nreimbursements or payments can be fetched from multiple\
    \ \nsystems in no time.\nPersonal Identity Record-keeping: Identity is an integral\
    \ \npart of society that provides a unique character and sense \nof acceptability\
    \ in a country. However, physical forms of \nnational identity are not accessible\
    \ to many people around \nthe world. The absence of identity makes it difficult\
    \ for \npeople to participate in voting, banking, employment and \nlimits the\
    \ chances of access to the financial system. Here \nblockchain steps in by providing\
    \ identity solutions through \nFig. 6  Blockchain elements\n2425\nA Systematic\
    \ Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\ndigital\
    \ identity. Additionally, self-sovereign identity arranges \noptions to store\
    \ one's identity on devices accessible across \nthe world [43].\nSupply chain\
    \ and logistics: Blockchain can bring great \nusability to supply chain management.\
    \ Procurement, trace-\nability, digital payments, and logistics are some areas\
    \ that \nhave benefitted from blockchain technology. The distributed \nledger\
    \ can reduce the sharing of operational data by provid-\ning a full view of the\
    \ sale/purchase data, accessible from \nany device. Fraud in the food supply chain\
    \ is prevalent in \nmany countries. Counterfeit products selling in the market\
    \ \nprove hazardous to the consumer. The Block chain’s QR \ntracking system along\
    \ with digitized physical products can \nbe used to track products from production\
    \ to delivery [44]. \nThis technology has started benefiting the agricultural\
    \ sec-\ntor to develop food safety and smart farming increasing the \nincome of\
    \ small farms and food producers.\nEducation: Keeping physical records and transcripts\
    \ can \nbe a hassle. This blockchain provides a solution for digitiz-\ning student\
    \ records, transcripts, and payment receipts [45]. \nDigital record-keeping can\
    \ benefit a student as it will be \nacceptable by universities across the globe,\
    \ free of manipula-\ntion, and handy. Blockchain can also be used to incentivize\
    \ \nstudents through a course credit system. The credit can be \ntranslated to\
    \ cryptocurrency, which can be further used as \nfee payment.\nBlockchain with\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT): Powerful \nunion of two futuristic technologies\
    \ makes machine-to-\nmachine transactions easier. The decentralized authority\
    \ \nof blockchain combined with the smart devices run by IoT \nallows a function\
    \ to autonomously execute without a central \nauthority [46]. Smart IoT run devices\
    \ can be implemented \non edge devices, reducing data transfer costs, and security\
    \ \nissues with the blockchain collaboration [47]. Blockchain \nintegration with\
    \ IoT can highly change the agricultural sec-\ntor. Supply chain traceability\
    \ could benefit the farmers in \neliminating the intermediaries through traceability\
    \ and RFID \ntag-based applications. Water, soil, climate, and other sen-\nsory-type\
    \ IoT devices can help in monitoring the agricultural \nactivities and gathering\
    \ the farm data and activities such as \ncultivation and livestock data in the\
    \ blockchain ledger. IoT \nwith blockchain will certainly revolutionize and transform\
    \ \nmany rural and urban sectors.\n1.2  Motivation and Major Contributions\nSustainable\
    \ Rural development starts with the participation \nof rural people in improving\
    \ their lifestyle. Without the peo-\nple working for their development, any implementation\
    \ or \nhelp is incomplete. Economic and technological sector links \nare important\
    \ for rural areas to develop. Along with that, a \nhealthy agricultural sector\
    \ improves the dweller’s linkage to \nthe global supply sector. By managing the\
    \ social, economic, \nenvironmental, and health objectives the development can\
    \ be \nfast-forwarded. There is a considerable amount of potential \nin rural\
    \ people which can be applied to employment issues, \nsocial disparities, E-governance,\
    \ women's rights etcetera. \nDeveloping rural areas can benefit nationally, economically,\
    \ \nand financially. This systematic literature review aims to pro-\nvide extensive\
    \ literature related to blockchain’s application \nin rural development and sustainable\
    \ living. A plethora of \nblockchain review papers available does not provide\
    \ a col-\nlective literature review of blockchain applications divided \ninto\
    \ different areas directed towards rural and sustainable \ndevelopment. Therefore,\
    \ clear and concise information can \nbe gained about blockchain’s work in improving\
    \ rural devel-\nopment providing scope for future research in this direction.\
    \ \nThe primary contributions are mentioned below:\n• A systematic review of relevant\
    \ literature for research \ntrends, key applications, and areas of implementing\
    \ \nBlockchain Technology for smart villages for sustain-\nable rural development.\n\
    • Identification of major issues in rural development and \nhow they can be addressed\
    \ using Blockchain Technology.\n• Exploration of the existing software, platforms,\
    \ and tools \nfor the implementation of Blockchain in Rural Develop-\nment.\n\
    • Identifications of the research gaps and future research \ndirections for applying\

    \ Review on Blockchain \nTechnology for Sustainable Rural \nDevelopment\nThe literature\
    \ review consists of the collective work of \nblockchain in rural development.\
    \ A total of 6 areas of \napplication were identified after careful extraction\
    \ of data \nand transformation globally namely: Agriculture, Bank-\ning, Environment,\
    \ Energy, Employment, and Healthcare. A \ndetailed discussion on the related work\
    \ is discussed in the \nsubsections.\n4.1  Agriculture\nIn the agriculture sector,\
    \ most of the application areas \nincluded supply chain traceability, facilitation\
    \ of smart agri-\nculture, and incentivization of services (Fig. 14). A detailed\
    \ \nsummary is given in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\n4.1.1  Supply Chain Traceability\n\
    The author F. Tian, [51] studied the integration of RFID \n(Radio-frequency Identification)\
    \ and blockchain technology \nin building the agri-food supply chain traceability\
    \ system. \nWith the help of blockchain technology, the information \nshared and\
    \ traceability is guaranteed. Apart from the sup-\nply chain, it also regulates\
    \ food safety and quality supervi-\nsion. This system can enhance the credibility\
    \ and reliabil-\nity of agri-food safety information. With the depletion of \n\
    an application cost, this system can effectively change the \ncurrent supply chain\
    \ to be more quality-enhanced and safe. \nSimilarly, Hua et al. proposed an agriculture\
    \ [65] provenance \nsystem based on blockchain featured by decentralization, \n\
    collective maintenance, consensus trust, and reliable data \nto solve the trust\
    \ crisis in the product supply chain. The \nsystem’s Target is to record information\
    \ related to the pro-\nduction supply chain: production, processing, storage,\
    \ trans-\nportation, and distribution of agricultural products. It also \nfacilitates\
    \ Recordkeeping from basic planting information \nto provenance records. The proposed\
    \ work solved the issue \nof the credibility of data and the difficulty of integrating\
    \ the \nsubsystem of each company.\nThe paper by Casado-Vara et al., [58] addressed\
    \ the issues \nof the current supply chain such as communication gaps \nbetween\
    \ vendors or the opacity of the origin of the product. \nThe author has proposed\
    \ a new model of the supply chain \nvia blockchain where all the members of the\
    \ supply chain \nsave all their transactions in the blockchain to ensure higher\
    \ \nsecurity. This model also enables a circular economy that \nis a make-use-recycle\
    \ model. With this model, all products \ncan be traced from their origin to their\
    \ sale and subsequent \nrecycling.\nFurther, Caro et al., [70] presented AgriBlockIoT\
    \ which \nis a fully decentralized blockchain-based traceability solu-\ntion for\
    \ agricultural food supply chain management. The \nproposed architecture based\
    \ on API includes a controller to \nconvert high-level function calls to corresponding\
    \ for the \nblockchain layer and blockchain itself which is the main \nFig. 10\

    blockchain can create transparent, fault-tolerant, immuta-\nble, and auditable\
    \ agri-food traceability records. The authors \nLi and Wang, [85] characterized\
    \ the research applications \nof blockchain in food supply traceability. With\
    \ the help of \nblockchain technology and various radiofrequency devices \ncan\
    \ be integrated to collect data from farms, deploy sensors, \nand create intelligent\
    \ contracts to implement server logic. \nThe new system can change the traditional\
    \ food supply sys-\ntem by making it more convenient, efficient, and trustable.\
    \ \nKim et al., [54] presented a theoretical, end-to-end, vis a vie \n“farm-to-fork”,\
    \ food traceability application named Harvest \nNetwork with the integration of\
    \ Blockchain technology and \nInternet-of-things. The process includes tracing\
    \ the prod-\nucts from processing, grading, transportation, temperature, \nand\
    \ contractual payment all with blockchain, IoT, and smart \ncontracts. This can\
    \ help consumers gain field-level insight \ninto the products. Lin et al., [63]\
    \ proposed an IoT and block-\nchain integrated self-organized, open, and ecological\
    \ food \ntraceability system. The proposed model consisted of trade, \nlogistics,\
    \ delivery, and warehousing information as well as \ndata from IoT devices such\
    \ as soil humidity, soil pH, and soil \nFig. 11  Areas of blockchain application\

    \ \ninformation about the product they buy with the help of a \ntrusted, self-organized\
    \ smart agriculture ecosystem.\nGalvez et al., [78] review the potential of blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology in guaranteeing traceability and authenticity in the \nfood supply\
    \ chain. The review included blockchain solutions \nto traceability problems.\
    \ It explained the use of a chronologi-\ncal distributed database to coordinate\
    \ individual activities. \nBy using a probabilistic approach to enable transparency\
    \ \nand verifiability without a central authority, enabling con-\nsensus on a\
    \ transaction to secure legitimate transactions, \nand time-stamped blocks providing\
    \ immutable records to \npreserve records the traceability issues were solved.\
    \ The \npaper also discussed the Block chain’s concept on the food \nsupply chain\
    \ which provides transparency, efficiency, secu-\nrity, and safety to the food\
    \ produce. According to Kamble \net al., [55], the supply chain practitioners\
    \ found a lack of \nefficiency and transparency which leads to constant threats\
    \ \nto formers and consumers. The system deployed the ISM \nmethodology to identify\
    \ Blockchain technology enablers \nin the agriculture supply chain. The findings\
    \ implied the \nacceptance of blockchain technology as an innovative tool to \n\
    ensure an efficient agriculture supply chain by the practition-\ners. To achieve\
    \ further traceability the farmers could cap-\nture relevant information about\
    \ the agricultural events onto \nthe blockchain to enable transparent and trusting\
    \ sources of \ninformation for the farmers. Kamilaris et al., [60] explored \n\
    how the food supply chain and agriculture were impacted \nby blockchain technology.\
    \ The stages of the supply chain \nwith blockchain technology has been identified\
    \ as (1) the \nprovider (2) producer, (3) processing, (4) distribution, (5) \n\
    retailer, and (6) consumer where a web application or device \ncan be used to\
    \ scan the item’s QR code to view its detailed \ninformation. Along with this,\
    \ the author explored various \nchallenges and benefits of the agricultural supply\
    \ chain \nand Blockchain’s collaboration. Salah et al., [66] proposed \na solution\
    \ of eliminating the third parties and centralized \nauthorities in the food supply\
    \ chain along with a security \nsystem for food traceability, transparent records,\
    \ and gov-\nernance of interactions and transactions between the users. \nThe\
    \ model entities are related to providing secure tracking \nof the product and\
    \ payment with Ethereum smart contracts. \nThus, the presented model for traceability\
    \ can be used to \ntrace and track the soybean supply chain. S. Missineo, [75]\
    \ \nproposed a model to secure storage origin provenance for \nfood data. The\
    \ proposed system aims to certify the produc-\ntion and the supply chain concerning\
    \ food local products \nby using Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. The\
    \ \nauthor aimed to ensure the authenticity of typical Sardinian \nproducts and\
    \ to sell them online or offline. The platform \nensured the consumer to check\
    \ the authenticity of the prod-\nuct before the purchase giving details on both\
    \ the production \nchain and supply chain. Jaiswal et al., [86] proposed mul-\n\
    tiple smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain \nfor decentralized\
    \ trading of food grains. The framework \nincluded Peer-to-peer trading, the security\
    \ of food grain \ndata, transparency, user anonymity, trust, and incentives as\
    \ \nkey features. The design of the framework consisted of four \ncontracts namely\
    \ food grain supply, bidding, trading, and \nutilization for the supply chain\
    \ management. Dong et al., \n[56] proposed a collaborative model of blockchain\
    \ and IoT \nin the agriculture sector. The data collection and transmis-\nsion\
    \ can be distinguished through a unique identity card \ngiven to each agricultural\
    \ product. All the environmental \naspects of the agricultural process can be\
    \ gathered at the \nsource. Along with that crop growth information, circulation\
    \ \nof the product using an RFID tag and distribution process \ncan also be recorded\
    \ and stored on the distributed ledger. \nA QR code attached to the product can\
    \ be scanned by the \nconsumer to view product information in details.\nFig. 14\

    \ to maintain tamper-proof records, \navoid intermediaries and provide security\
    \ to the transac-\ntions which in turn reduces transaction costs and improves\
    \ \nthe quality of the products. The food products are labeled \nwith RFID tags\
    \ to maintain the supply chain. The author \nexplained the revolutionary changes\
    \ blockchain technology \ncan bring to the supply chains and how it can increase\
    \ the \neconomic conditions of a country by reducing corruption \nrates and increasing\
    \ the satisfaction of producers and con-\nsumers. Paul et al., [83] proposed a\
    \ way to eliminate inter-\nmediaries between farmers and consumers to provide\
    \ the \nright amount for the farm produce. The proposed system \nconsists of blockchain\
    \ nodes namely Supply companies, \nlandowners, markets, and farmers. The farmer\
    \ node sets the \namount after the agreement period, the market node collects\
    \ \nand stores crops and stops intermediaries from manipulating \nthe prices,\
    \ the landlord node collects the money from the \nland on lease, and the supply\
    \ company node sells extra agri-\ncultural products to the farmers. This platform\
    \ named KHET \nwhere all the nodes are interconnected through Ethereum \nblockchain\

    \ of achieving demand and supply of crops which \navoids the farmer’s loss, catering\
    \ to consumer’s needs, pro-\nvides sustainable agricultural practices, reducing\

    \ Villages \n1 3\nnew markets. The system improved farming profitability \nand\
    \ endorsed the financial stability of cultivators. It also \nprovided health benefits,\
    \ reduced food wastage, eliminated \nmanipulation, and adulteration, and supports\
    \ the supply \nchain of agro-products. Saurabh and Dey, [69] identified the \n\
    potential divers of blockchain concerning the grape wine \nsupply chain. The smart\
    \ contract-based module was con-\nstructed to ensure trust between participants\
    \ during trans-\nactions. The proposed model enhanced the customization, \ncompetitiveness,\
    \ and usability of the supply chain.\nIqbal and Butt, [84] proposed a model to\
    \ save the farm-\ner’s crops from animals at night. A repelling and notifying\
    \ \nsystem (RNS) is installed in the field that receives signals \nduring an animal\
    \ attack. Human-safe ultrasonic waves are \nproduced by this RNS which drives\
    \ the animals away. This \nproposal also consists of a farm management system\
    \ that \nreceives the report regarding the hazards caused in the fields. \nThis\
    \ system enabled timely data delivery, efficient multi-hop \ncommunication, dependable\
    \ data transmission, and low-cost \ntechnology. Chun-Ting et al., [73] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased agricultural traceability service platform for tamper-\n\
    proof data storing and backup. The system design consists of \nData collecting\
    \ layer where IoT sensors collect environmen-\ntal data, the blockchain layer\
    \ takes data from the formal layer \nand sends them to blockchain nodes and later\
    \ to blocks, and \nthe application layer handles the requests to access transac-\n\
    tion data based on the transaction hash. Hegde et al., [81] \npresented different\
    \ ways of implementing blockchain with \nthe agricultural supply chain. With the\
    \ use of blockchain, the \nproducers can get data and income security, and keep\
    \ track \nof environmental changes that affect the crops. The trace-\nability\
    \ option provides clarity in any damage that occurred \nto the product and an\
    \ overall increase in efficiency can be \nachieved by producing only required\
    \ products hence reduc-\ning wastage. Peña et al., [89] presented a systematic\
    \ review \non blockchain in food supply chain management in Ecua-\ndor. According\
    \ to the review, most of the work was done in \nHyperledger composer, models for\
    \ business interactions and \nhuman interactions, Traceability, Security, and\
    \ Blockchain \nInformation.\nAdditionally, M. Kumarathunga, [57] after reviewing\
    \ \npresented the way to reduce transaction costs and improve \nfarmer’s involvement\
    \ in agricultural supply chains. To \nreduce transaction costs farmers can participate\
    \ in Infor-\nmation sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization, \nincentive\
    \ alignment, resource sharing, collaborative commu-\nnication, joint knowledge\
    \ creation. Xu et al., [80] reviewed \nthe working principle of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-\nfood sector. Blockchain technology provided data transpar-\nency,\
    \ data traceability, food safety, and quality monitoring, \nand agriculture finance.\
    \ Additionally, food safety and qual-\nity can be secured by digitizing products.\
    \ According to the \nreview, blockchain revealed a better approach to the future\
    \ \nof the agri-food supply chain which is safer, healthier, sus-\ntainable, and\
    \ reliable. Mirabelli and Solina, [71] collected \nand analyzed the applications\
    \ of blockchain technology and \nits contribution to agricultural food traceability\
    \ issues. The \nreview showed that the usability of blockchain technol-\nogy in\
    \ the agricultural sector was still in the early stage. \nThe review highlighted\
    \ three main aspects namely starting \nproblem, area of interest, and contribution.\
    \ Blockchain can \nbe a valid way to minimize fraud and errors in agricultural\
    \ \nsupply chains by increasing the quality and safety of food \nproducts. Shahid\
    \ et al., [53] have proposed a complete solu-\ntion to the blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ and food supply \nchain. The paper aimed to provide an end-to-end solution \n\
    to the growing blockchain-based agri-food supply chains. \nFurther, it achieved\
    \ the following properties: accountability, \ncredibility, auditability, autonomy,\
    \ and authenticity. The sys-\ntem also acted as a better alternative to the existing\
    \ supply \nchain system by enabling a scalable and auditable system. \nAwan et al.,\
    \ [79] proposed a smart agricultural model as a \ntransformation to the traditional\
    \ agricultural supply chain. \nThe system consists of Seed seller, Farmer, Crop\
    \ buyer, \nProcessor, Crop storage, Distributor, Retailer, Customer. \nTo improve\
    \ the food supply chain’s productivity and reli-\nability the smart model was\
    \ proposed. The model allowed \nfarmers to enter and monitor the data in the plant.\
    \ The main \nobjective of this model was to provide equal opportunities to \n\
    the participants of the agricultural food supply chain. The-\njaswini and Ranjitha,\
    \ [64] proposed a model that explores \nthe problems faced by people in agriculture\
    \ production and \nits solutions based on blockchain technology. Blockchain \n\
    solutions for traceability of crops, disclosure of data, clarity \nin food production,\
    \ and authentic agricultural products was \nproposed by the author. This proposed\
    \ model ensured food \nsafety, benefitted farmers, and stakeholders.\nYadav et al.,\
    \ [67] reviewed the blockchain adoption bar-\nriers in the Indian agricultural\
    \ supply chain. The barriers \ncan be enumerated as Lack of proper government\
    \ regulation \nand regularity uncertainty, Huge resource, and initial capital\
    \ \nrequirement, security and privacy concerns, lack of interop-\nerability and\
    \ standardization, etc. Further, the barriers were \nmodeled using an integrated\
    \ ISM-DEMATEL approach \nwhich provided limited interpretative logic. W. Lin,\
    \ [59] \nprovided a survey to study the techniques and applications \nof blockchain\
    \ technology. The application categories of \nblockchain in agriculture are Provenance\
    \ traceability and \nfood authentication, smart farming data management, trade\
    \ \nfinance in the supply chain management, and other informa-\ntion management\
    \ systems. The paper also indicated possible \nfuture developments and applications\
    \ of blockchain. Dutta \net al., [61] reviewed articles related to blockchain\
    \ technol-\nogy’s integration with various supply chain operations. The \nbenefits\
    \ of Blockchain in supply chains can be enumer-\nated as Data management, Improvement\
    \ in transparency, \n2444\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nImprovement in response\

    \ the main supply chain functions were identified \nas supply chain provenance,\
    \ supply chain resilience, supply \nchain re-engineering, security enhancement,\
    \ business pro-\ncess management, and product management. The work also \nexamined\
    \ various challenges and impacts of blockchain in \nthe supply chain. Shahid et al.,\
    \ [77] proposed a solution for \na blockchain-based reputation system in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfood supply chain. The system model consisted of invoking \nsmart contracts\
    \ to provide reviews based on the services to \nthe providers. The reviews are\
    \ requested by buyers and the \nsellers’ review the transactions and perform other\
    \ transac-\ntions based on that. The system was proposed to maintain \nthe immutability\
    \ and integrity of the registered review. \nTorky and Hassanein, [82] presented\
    \ a comprehensive sur-\nvey on IoT and blockchain and their importance in devel-\n\
    oping smart applications. According to the review, crops \noverseeing, livestock\
    \ grazing, and food supply chain are a \nfew subsectors in precision agriculture\
    \ managed by block-\nchain platforms. Apart from that, a novel blockchain model\
    \ \nwas also proposed to use as an important solution for major \nchallenges in\
    \ IoT-based precision agricultural systems. The \nobjectives of Skender and Zaninović,\
    \ [74] in their paper \nwere to analyze blockchain technology’s overall perspec-\n\
    tive, investigate its potential in a sustainable supply chain \nto replace the\
    \ shortcomings in the traditional supply chain. \nThe traceability and transparency\
    \ in the agricultural supply \nchain can be improved with blockchain.\nTo better\
    \ understand the benefits and challenges and the \nperspective for sustainable\
    \ blockchain, the author provided \na conceptual framework. Borah et al., [68]\
    \ proposed a novel \nblockchain-based Farmer and Rely called FARMAR. The \nsystem\
    \ could provide fair prices and reduce duping by mid-\ndlemen. The assets can\
    \ be traced from farmers to consumers, \nreducing the artificial inflation of\
    \ prices. Ferrag et al., (2020) \n[76] reviewed the research challenges on IoT-based\
    \ agricul-\nture and its security and privacy issues. The rest of the paper \n\
    identified threat models against green IoT-based agriculture \nanalyzed the privacy-oriented\
    \ blockchain-based solutions \nand consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture.\
    \ \nEnescu and Ionescu, [52] proposed a model for farmers in \nthe agri-food sector\
    \ using blockchain. This system ensures a \ncredible supply chain for producers\
    \ and consumers, guaran-\nteed timely payments between the participants. The authors\
    \ \nproposed this system to provide transparency, security, and \ntrust in the\
    \ trading process. Chaudhari et al., [90] proposed \na framework for a secure\
    \ and transparent supply chain with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With\
    \ the help of this sys-\ntem, the farmers can get a fair price for their products.\
    \ This \ntransparent and tamper-proof supply chain system generates \na bill at\
    \ the end including the commissioning price as well as \nthe total price after\
    \ sold product hence benefiting the farm-\ners in knowing the selling and market\
    \ price. Xie et al., [91] \nproposed to construct a traceability framework For\
    \ fresh \nE-commerce agricultural product quality and safety based \non blockchain\
    \ technology. To access the key control points \nthe author used the FMECA (failure\
    \ model effect and key \nanalysis) to analyze the failure mode, impact, and hazards\
    \ \nin the traceability chain. This system can promote agricul-\ntural development\
    \ through decentralization, consensus trust, \nmaintenance, and reliable database\
    \ features.\nFurthermore, Li et al., [92] proposed a blockchain-based \nTraceability\
    \ of the fresh food supply chain With the help of \nbusiness process reengineering\
    \ (BPR). The overall traceabil-\nity architecture is based on key links’ product\
    \ quality data \nand participants’ transactions. The objective of this trace-\n\
    ability system was to ensure data integrity. Flores et al., [93] \nproposed a\
    \ model for decentralization of data and provide \ntraceability of agricultural\
    \ products with blockchain tech-\nnology. Using this method could guarantee transparency\
    \ of \nthe supply chain and other operations as well as the transac-\ntions involved.\
    \ Fernandez et al., [94] proposed a Blockchain-\nbased model to improve farmer’s\
    \ profits. The author aimed \nto improve the output primitives of the supply chain.\
    \ Farmer-\nto-consumer product tracking and cost were the main factors \nin improving\
    \ traceability in the supply chain. Cortez-Zaga \net al., [95] proposed a model\
    \ used in the Peruvian agricul-\ntural sector using blockchain. When using blockchain\
    \ it can \neliminate dependence on a central entity, provides integrity \nof the\
    \ process, transactions become irrevocable, secure, \nand private, and provides\
    \ transparency and immutability. \nG. Zhao, [96] presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that \nexplored the advances in the agri-food supply chain. The \npaper\
    \ also pointed out the challenge of the applications of \nblockchain technology\
    \ enumerated as storage capacity and \nscalability, privacy leakage, high-cost\
    \ problem, regulation \nproblem, throughput and latency issues, and lack of skills.\n\
    Land record maintenance using blockchain was also \nproposed by Bhorshetti et al.,\
    \ for easy maintenance of land \nrecords in real-time. The database proved to\
    \ be a non-failure \nsystem and the work provided intermediary-less land title\
    \ \ntransfer and processing between owners. This system pro-\nvided security,\
    \ transparency, and a broker-free land man-\nagement system [97]. The paper by\
    \ Thakur et al. presented \nthe issues related to land records maintenance, registration,\
    \ \nsettlements, and banks. The system ensured better land man-\nagement, lesser\

    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nthis system can regain\
    \ the people’s trust in the food mar-\nket, the government can collect statistics\
    \ on various kinds \nof food, and adulterated and fake food in the market can\
    \ \nbe eliminated. This type of technology can benefit the cus-\ntomer, manufacturers,\
    \ and supervision departments of the \nfood supply chain. Wu and Tsai, [103] proposed\
    \ an intel-\nligent agriculture network security system by applying dark \nweb\
    \ technology to monitor packet transmission frequency in \norder to prevent DDOS\
    \ attacks. The system applied a dark-\nnet mechanism to identify anyone who attempts\
    \ to access \nblockchain data. It also incorporated IoT sensors to gather \ndata\
    \ regarding temperature, humidity, and soil. This model \nwas proposed to keep\
    \ track of the farms and cultivation fac-\ntors related to an environment and\
    \ to establish network secu-\nrity for IoT networks.\n4.1.3  Organic Farming\n\
    Reddy and Kumar, [101] presented the article based on the \nsustainability of\
    \ the food supply chain. The author's objec-\ntive was to achieve Fair Trading\
    \ and a circular economy with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With this framework,\
    \ the \nfollowing results but achieved: Automatic hashing for less \nelectricity\
    \ consumption, product malfunctioning and add \nalteration, the involvement of\
    \ middlemen, availability of \nfarming jobs, and facilitating development and\
    \ unity among \nfarmers. According to Basnayake and Rajapakse, [104], the \npurpose\
    \ of the research was to implement a Blockchain-\nbased solution to verify food\
    \ quality. The process included \nFarmers issuing a product contract to control\
    \ the quality of \neach product. For each deployment of the product contract,\
    \ \nit would return an address that was used to generate the QR \ncode to identify\
    \ the physical product. Lastly, Consumers \nwere also eligible to rate the product\
    \ quality to ensure trust.\n4.1.4  Smart Agriculture\nTo overcome remote monitoring\
    \ challenges and provide \nsecurity and privacy in agriculture, Patil et al.,\
    \ [105] pro-\nposed a lightweight architecture for smart greenhouse farm-\ning.\
    \ The model consisted of four groups showing the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ with IoT namely (1) smart greenhouse, (2) \noverlay network, (3) Cloud storage,\
    \ and (4) End-user. This \nmodel can be used to successfully monitor the secure\
    \ trans-\nmission of greenhouse data. Umamaheshwari et al., [106] \nproposed a\
    \ model for Buying and selling crops and land. \nThe model used Ethers as a cryptocurrency.\
    \ According to \nthe paper, the recordkeeping of crops grown in the land was \n\
    useful to know the history of plantations in the land. With \nthe help of this\
    \ model, users were able to access real-time \ndata about crops, eliminate the\
    \ need for middlemen, and \nestablish a transparent and efficient system. Voutos\
    \ et al., \n[107] proposed the integration of IoT and smart contracts \nto develop\
    \ smart agriculture to deliver higher quality agri-\ncultural products. It also\
    \ focuses on improving the associ-\nated supply chain and logistics benefiting\
    \ the participants \ninvolved. The author discussed the factors of smart agri-\n\
    culture as soil factors, climate, sensors, research, supply \nchain, storage,\
    \ analytics, and smart contracts. Miloudi et al., \n[100] proposed IoT, Blockchain,\
    \ and Geospatial technology-\nbased Smart farming to manage the farming practices\
    \ more \nsmartly and sustainably. The system proposed smart farming \nmanagement\
    \ in 4 stages namely (1) Integrated blockchain \nwith IoT platform where various\
    \ IoT sensors apply analytics \nand sends data to the blockchain, (2) Blockchain\
    \ Working \nMethodology where data visibility is provided through smart \ncontracts,\
    \ (3) Integrating GIS with blockchain where the \ndata sent from IoT sensors are\
    \ improvised and accuracy is \nfacilitated through GIS geospatial tools, and (4)\
    \ certifying \nfarmers in blockchain stage facilitates authorities and privi-\n\
    leges to the farmers through smart contracts which could \ngreatly benefit farmers\
    \ and food production industry.\nFurthermore, Devi Et al., [108] Proposed a design\
    \ archi-\ntecture by merging IoT and BC for smart agriculture. The \nnodes involved\
    \ in the blockchain received the information \nfrom the sensors that were connected\
    \ to the things involved \nin the Smart Agriculture monitoring process. The design\
    \ \narchitecture enhanced the security and data transparency \nperformance of\
    \ smart agriculture. Vangala et al., [109] \nreviewed blockchain technology and\
    \ its information security \nschemes. The application areas covered by the authors\
    \ were \nagriculture monitoring, controlled agriculture/smart green-\nhouses,\
    \ food supply chain tracking, and precision farming/\nsmart farming. The review\
    \ also presented a thorough analy-\nsis of the security attributes, application\
    \ areas, advantages, \ndrawbacks, and competing schemes’ cost of computation \n\
    and communication. Branco et al., [110] proposed a con-\nceptual approach with\
    \ the integration of IoT and blockchain \nfor a mushroom farm distribution process\
    \ control system. \nThe proposed system allowed the collection of distributed\
    \ \ndata on the environmental factors contributing to mushroom \nproduction providing\
    \ collection, storage, and processing of \nmushroom farm data to be scalable,\
    \ immutable, transparent, \nauditable, and secure.\n4.1.5  Dairy Farming\nMisra\
    \ and Das, [111] presented a conceptual framework \nusing blockchain to bring\
    \ feasibility and efficiency in \nE-governance. The architecture consisted of\
    \ a service-\noriented architecture framework to store details of stake-\nholders\
    \ involved in user services on demand, a blockchain \narchitecture that would\
    \ allow stakeholders to authenticate \nand perform transactions on the ledger,\
    \ and digital identity \narchitecture to act as a regulator in the architecture.\
    \ With \na dairy farmer as a user or participant in the architecture \n2446\n\
    \ \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nwho would benefit from the transactions while\
    \ having vot-\ning rights and leadership entities in the system the author \n\
    conceptually explored the prototype of the dairy coopera-\ntive sector in India.\
    \ Similarly, Rambim and Awuor, [112] \nproposed a model for dairy farmers in Kenya\
    \ that explores \nthe potential use of blockchain technology in milk delivery\
    \ \nin rural areas. From the Naitiri Dairy farmers’ cooperative \n(NADAFA) in\
    \ Kenya, the author introduced a Milk Deliv-\nery Blockchain Manager (MDBM) which\
    \ is a decentralized \nplatform to automatically capture the quantity and quality\
    \ \nof milk delivered by the farmers. The delivery data stored \nin the blockchain\
    \ is immutable, cryptographically hashed, \nand digitally signed. The details\
    \ of delivery are accessible \nto the farmers. The NADAFA facilitates the system\
    \ and pro-\nvides payment to the dairy farmers on time. The consortium-\nbased\
    \ network provides leveraging blockchain solutions for \nfarmers.\n4.1.6  Livestock\n\
    Under Livestock monitoring, Alonso et al., [113] worked on \nimportant trends\
    \ in the applications of IoT and edge comput-\ning paradigms in the smart farming\
    \ field. This helps produc-\ners to optimize processes, provides the origin of\
    \ the product, \nand guarantees the quality to its consumers. The state of \n\
    dairy cattle and feed grain can be monitored in real-time by \nusing artificial\
    \ intelligence and blockchain technology. This \nis to ensure the traceability\
    \ and sustainability of different \nprocesses of farming. The implementation of\
    \ smart farm-\ning contributed to the reduction of data traffic and reliable \n\
    communications between IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. \nAccording to Hang et al.,\
    \ [114], the uncertain data qual-\nity of analysts’ data can be solved through\
    \ blockchain. The \nproposed structure brings scalability, off-chain storage,\
    \ pri-\nvacy, and high throughput as advancement to the previous \nversion. Various\
    \ IoT data is fetched from fish farms such \nas temperature, water level, oxygen,\
    \ and PH data. The data \nstorage can be a database or cloud and end-user can\
    \ view \nthe fish farm’s detailed information through smart devices. \nLeme et al.,\
    \ [147] proposed a novel infrastructure based on \nthe integration of cloud storage\
    \ and blockchain technology \nto monitor the overall health of livestock. The\
    \ components \nof the architecture can be named as (1) Administrator, (2) \nUsers,\
    \ (3) Cloud service, and (4) blockchain network. With \nthe help of RFID tags\
    \ attached to the cattle, various entities \ncan be monitored to ensure that cattle\
    \ go through necessary \nprocedures. Yang et al., [115] proposed a novel method\
    \ to \nensure traceability and authenticity in the livestock supply \nchain using\
    \ blockchain. The model uses RFID-sensor-based \nlivestock monitoring in the food\
    \ industry where the sen-\nsors augment the physical tracking and solved the RFID’s\
    \ \ninherent computational capacity limitation by using cloud \nservices. The\
    \ data is then made accessible to the end con-\nsumer through Block chain’s transparent\
    \ ledger.\n4.1.7  E‑Agriculture\nThe analysis proposed by Li et al., [116] Investigated\
    \ the \nconvenience of sustainable electronic agriculture based on \nBlockchain\
    \ technology and analyzed the application likeli-\nhood and challenges of Blockchain\
    \ in the agricultural field. \nThe authors selected 5 villages with similar development\
    \ \nrates in china and Blockchain technology was applied using \ndata statistics\
    \ to the sustainable e-agriculture for exploring \nits convenience. Results showed\
    \ that sustainable electronic \nagriculture based on Blockchain Technology brought\
    \ great \nconvenience to the farmer’s sales, increasing by 25% on \naverage compared\
    \ with traditional electronic agriculture. \nSong et al. [117], to improve the\
    \ biased point of view, higher \ninitial costs, and lack of transparency and trust\
    \ proposed a \nsystem for providing sustainability in the current agri-food \n\
    supply chain. The paper discussed blockchain adoption in \nrural areas and relative\
    \ energy consumption from supply and \ndemand perspectives.\n4.1.8  Agriculture\
    \ Monitoring\nArshad et al., [99] proposed a private blockchain-based \nsecure\
    \ access control for agriculture to monitor climatic \nparameters. Private Blockchain\
    \ access control (PBAC) was \nused to guarantee secure communications where a\
    \ user usu-\nally goes through initialization, authentication, and revo-\ncation.\
    \ The farms monitoring system consists of the login \nphase, system setup phase,\
    \ user/farm professional registra-\ntion phase, password authentication and session\
    \ key agree-\nment phase, update or change phase, and addition of node \nphase.\
    \ The whole system stores access records and lessen \nthe computational and communication\
    \ overhead. Forbye, \nN. Bore, [118] proposed a model to improve the shortcom-\n\
    ings of existing digitized farming models through the AG-\nWallet System (AGWS).\
    \ The AGWS design consisted of (1) \ndigitizing the far demand–supply, (2) The\
    \ farm information \npipeline was to ensure secure storage and validate events\
    \ \nreceived from IoT, and (3) data analytic services that make \nthe information\
    \ visible to the participants. The system pro-\nposed by Osmanoglu et al., [119]\
    \ uses a blockchain-based \nyield estimation solution. Farmers can share the farming\
    \ \nplans for the upcoming harvesting season with other par-\nticipants, or learn\
    \ from other’s plans to review their plans. \nSmart contracts can be employed\
    \ by participants to share \ntheir yield commitments. The author improvised a\
    \ censor-\nship-resistant, tamper-proof, and immutable public ledger of \ntime-stamped\
    \ transactions.\n2447\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology\
    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n4.1.9  Farmers\nTalreja et al., (2020) [121] proposed\
    \ a farmer’s portal with \nthe help of blockchain technology and python to preserve\
    \ the \ncontract of trade between farmers and consumers. The farm-\ner’s portal\
    \ is a way to access farm activities. The proposed \nwork enhanced the degree\
    \ of participation, reduced inter-\nmediary cost, simplified process, provided\
    \ ease of selling \ncrops, and greater efficiency. The immutability of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology fortified farmers for getting a fair price for their \ncrops and\
    \ reduced operational costs. Abraham and Kumar, \n[120] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ data security system to \npreserve farmer’s data. The proposed work was based\
    \ on a \nprivate-permissioned blockchain for controlled participation, \nhyper\
    \ ledger fabric to support smart contracts, and system \ndesign to safely store\
    \ farm data. The widened blockchain \ndata helps farmer’s data to be accessed\
    \ by other participants \nwhich can allow the government to sanction schemes based\
    \ \non farmer’s data. Topart et al., [122] proposed an interoper-\nable ecosystem\
    \ of farmer’s consent management. The model \nused a permissioned blockchain to\
    \ allow only a specific \ngroup of people to access the services. The immutability\
    \ of \nconsent allows the data to be non-manipulative, distributed, \nsigned transactions,\
    \ and transparent. The consent verifica-\ntion for each data allows only valid\
    \ users to request data. \nThe model was proposed to respect the privacy, security,\
    \ \ntransparency, and consent of the farmer’s data.\n4.1.10  Incentivization\n\
    Blockchain has been using incentive mechanisms since bit-\ncoin to incentivize\
    \ miners, but recently many authors have \npresented ways of promoting work for\
    \ a reward. Incentives \nto promote sustainable agricultural practices by Giaffreda\
    \ \net al., [123]. Objectives include savings and increasing \nmarket value plus\
    \ monitoring the use of water in the fields. \nFarmers have been relying on satellite\
    \ data as it is a cheap \nsource of agricultural services. With the use of LPWAN\
    \ net-\nworks, accuracy in fields is increased along with a tensiom-\neter-a sensing\
    \ unit that is used to wirelessly communicate \nthe data related to the humidity\
    \ of the soil and a mini-meteo \nstation that is used to measure temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and \nair pressure. Smart contracts record the transactions from\
    \ the \ncalculated results in the cloud and release the incentives to \nthe farmer\
    \ according to their deal with the stakeholder. The \nproposal includes EnvCoins\
    \ as the incentives, which can be \nfurther used to buy technologies for sustainable\
    \ agricultural \npractices, for cash, or investment. Esmaeilian et al., [124]\
    \ \nproposed an incentive mechanism for green behavior such \nas waste disposal,\
    \ using re-furbished products, purchasing \nenergy-efficient products, saving\
    \ energy, recover, repair, \nand maintain. The tokens gained from sustainable\
    \ behav-\nior can be further used to access services on blockchain. \nIncentivization\
    \ can ameliorate some of the environmental \nissues in rural areas with the help\
    \ of rural people by moti-\nvating them to clean the areas. OpenLitterMap by S.\
    \ Lynch, \n[125] uses geospatial analysis to geotag various types of \nlitter.\
    \ It uses LitterCoins as an incentive mechanism for the \nproof of work. This\
    \ is to motivate people to submit correct \ndata. It also rewards for uploading\
    \ litter images from a new \nlocation. Apart from plastic and other homogenous\
    \ litter, a \nproposal to eliminate solid waste from small municipalities \nin\
    \ return for a reward is given by França et al., [148]. The \nprovision was to\
    \ change the original system from attack risk, \ndata loss, power outage, and\
    \ other such problems. The new \ndigitized system proves to be a handier as it\
    \ is in the form of \na mobile application. The reward for selling solid waste\
    \ to \nthe collecting agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocurrency sent \nto the\
    \ seller’s virtual wallet. This initiative led to comput-\nerization gains, information\
    \ integrity, and the use of crypto-\ncurrency. Additionally, in [128] D. Zhang,\
    \ worked on a simi-\nlar solution to efficiently use rural waste in incentivizing\
    \ \nrural people. The process includes the installation of smart \nbins and when\
    \ they are full, the collection trucks will swap \nthe waste for a digital coupon\
    \ which the farmer can use to \neither get agricultural products from the waste\
    \ to the energy \nplant or cash them. Blockchain makes it an easier process to\
    \ \ntransfer and record data faster with maximum transparency. \nOther applications\
    \ of incentives for waste include Recereum, \nSwachhCoin, Plastic Bank, 4New,\
    \ and OILSC [129].\nThe motivational incentive mechanism can also transform \n\
    the way medical data is shared for research and diagnosis. In \nthe paper by Zhu\
    \ et al., [126], the authors gave a solution to \nactuate people into sharing\
    \ medical data by providing them \nrewards for doing so. The rewards system is\
    \ based on the \naccess provided by the owner of the medical file. Through \n\
    Smart contracts, a trusted payment money flow can be \ndevised between the third\
    \ party and the owner. The Shapley \nvalue was considered for the revenue distribution\
    \ of medi-\ncal data sharing and to study the impact of consensus on \nthe miner’s\
    \ income. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism \nfor the accident alert system,\
    \ proposed by Devi and Pamila, \n[127] is another blockchain-based medical application.\
    \ \nAccording to the authors, most of the accidents occurs near \nrural places\
    \ where medical help is unreachable on time. To \neliminate the privacy issue\
    \ of the nearby user who receives \nthe accident report, a blockchain-based incentive\
    \ method \nis implemented for the user who receives the accident alert \nto send\
    \ the location of the victim to a close-by emergency \nservice. Then the message\
    \ initiator gets rewarded incen-\ntives for alerting about the accident. A similar\
    \ report system \nmobile application for anonymous reporting is proposed by \n\
    Zou et al., [130] in which reporting any incident can earn \npeople rewards. The\
    \ design goal of the author was to imple-\nment an anonymous report system, to\
    \ provide privacy to the \nperson who reports, without having to give their personal\
    \ \n2448\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\ninformation to the system. This model\
    \ induces incentive \nnamed Rcoins to whoever published the report information,\
    \ \nthe repliers, and the consenting miners. The Blockchain and \nKudos by Sharples\
    \ and Dominigue, [131], a reward-based \npermanent solution as the digital record-keeping\
    \ model. The \nauthor proposed the use of blockchain to store digital certifi-\n\
    cates, achievements, and credits. Stored as a public record \nit can be accessed\
    \ by the institutions or the student online. \nThe model uses Kudos an educational\
    \ reputation currency \nas a reward. The reward can be earned through uploading\
    \ \ncertificates on the blockchain, passing a test, or on course \ncompletion.\
    \ Another application of blockchain-based incen-\ntive system is EduCTX by Turkanović\
    \ et al., [132] which \nis proposed to globally enable the higher education credit\
    \ \nplatform. For potential stakeholders such as educational \ninstitutions, companies,\
    \ and organizations a unified view \nof student’s higher education credits and\
    \ grading system \nis placed on the global ledger through blockchain. ECTX \n\
    tokens will be credited based on the completion of courses \nwhich will act as\
    \ proof of completed courses.\n4.2  Environment\nIn the environment sector, the\
    \ most emphasis was given \non blockchain applications in Natural hazards, Water,\
    \ and \nWaste management in rural areas (Fig. 15). A detailed sum-\nmary is given\
    \ in Table 8.\n4.2.1  Waste Management\nFrom the articles proposed, in D. Zhang,\
    \ [128] the author \nworked on a similar solution to efficiently use rural waste\
    \ \nin incentivizing rural people. This framework is based on \nChina’s Yitong\
    \ system which is waste to energy plant for \nagricultural waste and the use of\
    \ blockchain to provide digi-\ntal coupons or cryptocurrency in return for waste.\
    \ The author \nproposed the use of a web application to use a QR code \nscanner\
    \ when the waste is collected from a smart bin, also \nencouraging segregation\
    \ of agricultural waste and residential \nwaste. The serves receive the weight\
    \ of waste, lodges it on \nthe global ledger, and the coupon is rewarded based\
    \ on the \nweight. Apart from plastic and other homogenous litter, a \nproposal\
    \ to eliminate solid waste from small municipali-\nties in return for a reward\
    \ is given by França et al., [148]. \nThe provision was to change the original\
    \ system from attack \nrisk, data loss, power outage, and other such problems.\
    \ The \nnew digitized system proves to be a handier as it is in the \nform of\
    \ a mobile application. The reward for selling solid \nwaste to the collecting\
    \ agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocur-\nrency sent to the seller’s virtual wallet.\
    \ This initiative led to \ncomputerization gains, information integrity, and the\
    \ use of \ncrypto-currency.\nLatif et al., [133] have addressed the smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment system with the integration of IoT and blockchain. The \nproposed\
    \ model included identification of waste material, \ntrace location, send to trash,\
    \ categorize waste, transfer waste, \nrecycling, and decision-making process.\
    \ The sensor nodes \nin the model were used for waste identification, and adding\
    \ \nnew blocks and the admin and waste management offices \nwere responsible for\
    \ collecting, executing recycling, and \ndelivering products. The recyclable wastes\
    \ are transformed \ninto useful products and share with the customers and send\
    \ \nthe non-recyclable wastes to the trash.\nFig.15  Blockchain applications \n\

    \ smart contracts execute the claims to the farm-\ners. Deployment of the system\
    \ can ensure water supply in \nrural areas and accessibility of insurance in case\
    \ of droughts \nor floods.\n4.2.3  Water Management\nThe intelligent smart watering\
    \ system proposed by Munir \net al., [135] is a blockchain-based system for the\
    \ smart \nconsumption of water. The system uses IoT for capturing \nreal-time\
    \ environment conditions such as soil moisture \nlevel, light intensity, air humidity,\
    \ and air temperature. The \nmain focus of the proposed system was to develop\
    \ a healthy \necosystem while efficiently using water in plantations and \ngardening.\
    \ Forbye, A water control system to efficiently \nmanage and coordinate the use\
    \ of water in irrigation com-\nmunities is proposed by Bordel et al., [136]. The\
    \ prosumer \nenvironment in the model is composed of a rule definition \nmodule\
    \ where users can create irrigation recipes using ECA \n(Event-Condition-Action)\
    \ rules. These rules are executable \nand easily transformed into other programming\
    \ languages. \nInputs are taken by a transformation engine, to create, com-\n\
    pile, and deploy a set of Smart Contracts coding all the irri-\ngation and management\
    \ logic. Finally, irrigation recipes are \nexecuted by an execution engine, which\
    \ invokes deployed \nSmart Contracts to interact with the infrastructure. From\
    \ \nthe perspective of Dogo et al., [137] proposed convergence \nof IoT and Blockchain.\
    \ Objectives of smart water solutions \ninclude smart measuring and monitoring\
    \ across the water \ndistribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the gener-\n\
    ated data, and enhanced revenue and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hassija et al., [138]\
    \ proposed a drone-mounted \nbase station in the tactile internet environment\
    \ based on \nblockchain. The drone-mounted small cell station was based \non a\
    \ Permissioned peer-to-peer blockchain. To take strategic \ndecisions, a game\
    \ theory model was deployed. The deci-\nsion was based on user association; transmit\
    \ power level, \ndrone speed, and altitude. Additionally, smart contracts can\
    \ \nadd parameters and conditions based on requirements. The \nmodel’s results\
    \ showed that the low network areas can expe-\nrience better bandwidth with the\
    \ proposed system.\nFurther, the proposed model by Pincheira et al., [139] pre-\n\
    sented a trustless water management system-based software \narchitecture. The\
    \ system proposed presented a decentralized \nwater management system that could\
    \ incentivize virtuous \nbehavior in agricultural practices. Smart contracts were\
    \ used \nfor their intermediary-less characteristic. The authors also \nimplemented\
    \ a cross-platform software library to allow con-\nstrained devices to interact\

    \ A. Parashar \n1 3\n4.3.1  Energy Grid\nIn the energy sector, rural electrification\
    \ and the use of \nrenewable energy were mainly focused on in the articles. \n\
    Enescu et al., [140] proposed a study on the use of photovol-\ntaic energy. The\
    \ paper showed the use of photovoltaic panels \nto power a power plant for the\
    \ improvement of abandoned \nland. According to the authors, photovoltaic panels\
    \ can eas-\nily pump water and is a more appropriate use of solar energy. \nBlockchain\
    \ can help reduce the intermediary distributors \nhence making the selling and\
    \ buying of energy more profit-\nable. Additionally, Kulkarni and Kulkarni, [141],\
    \ consider-\ning the lack of electricity in rural India, proposed a model to \n\
    solve rural electrification problems. The model introduces \npeer-to-peer energy\
    \ trading through blockchain suitable for \nsmall and remote micro-grids. A reliable\
    \ and profitable elec-\ntricity supply can be obtained through micro-grids. Smart\
    \ \ncontract-based meters allow transparency in the daily usage \nof energy used\
    \ hence encouraging rural people into investing \nin blockchain-based electrification.\n\
    4.3.2  Renewable Energy\nLevi-Oguike et al., [142] have presented the challenges\
    \ and \nmodalities for the adoption of blockchain technologies and \nto ensure\
    \ energy efficiency as an advancement to the sub-\nSaharan Africa environment.\
    \ In the case study performed \nby the authors, the following factors affected\
    \ its use to a \nlarge extent in sub-Saharan Africa: Employment and edu-\ncation,\
    \ displacement and resettlement, financing the tech-\nnology, regulatory provisions,\
    \ operational modalities, and \nparanoia and wariness. The overall objective of\
    \ the paper \nwas to ensure that the sub-Saharan region was involved in \nthe\
    \ innovative and industrial revolution wave. From Krajna-\nkova et al., [143]\
    \ author’s perspective following Scientific \ninduction and deduction were made:\
    \ The proposed Bio-\nmass blockchain structure is based on the use of traditional\
    \ \nresources but the transactions are processed exclusively in a \ndigital environment.\
    \ The user can know the precise amount \nof energy and time when it is transferred\
    \ to the consumer \nalso ensuring real-time payment for the energy. According\
    \ \nto the system Deal signed between biomass energy producer \nand consumer and\

    4.4  Banking\nIn the banking sector, most of the solutions were about \nissues\
    \ in banking availability in rural areas, loan sanctions \nto under-documented\
    \ people, and methods of transferring \nmoney (Fig. 17). A detailed summary is\
    \ given in Table 10.\n4.4.1  Loan\nGuo et al., [151] proposed a novel poverty\
    \ alleviation loan \nmanagement called the Loan On Blockchain (LoC). In the \n\
    LoC, the participating roles can be named as the Financial \ndepartment to check\
    \ the identity and application informa-\ntion of the participants, bank to provide\
    \ loan to the cus-\ntomer, Customer to provide identity and apply for loan, civil\
    \ \naffairs department to audit the customer identity and loan \napplications,\
    \ Regulator to monitor fund flow and inspect \nledger. This digital account model\
    \ was proposed for decen-\ntralized and centralized transfer of assets. Similarly,\
    \ Jain \net al., [152] presented a solution named Bit-score for credit \nscoring\
    \ for underprivileged (rural) people with the help of \nblockchain. The authors’\
    \ model used a self-sovereign model \nfor identity, distributed ledger storage,\
    \ credit score calcula-\ntion without any extra charges, and non-financial factor\
    \ for \nacquiring credit score. With bit-score being an improvisation \nover traditional\
    \ credit scoring techniques it makes the \ntransactions more transparent, decentralized,\
    \ secure, and \nintermediary-free.\n4.4.2  Mobile Money\nY. Hu, [150] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based digital payment \nsystem to deliver reliable services on\
    \ unreliable network \nservices in rural areas. The system management contract\
    \ \nto record account types, user balances to avoid forks dur-\ning disconnection\
    \ with the help of smart contracts. True \ntransparency can be obtained through\
    \ digitization and eco-\nnomic growth can be boosted in poor countries. Ghatpande\
    \ \net al., [149] proposed a way of moving Secure, interoperable \nmobile money\
    \ in sub-Saharan Africa (SIGMMA) to sup-\nport semi-offline payments through blockchain.\
    \ The model \nprovides unreachable areas a monetary transaction solution \nwithout\
    \ having to provide any identity proof while ensuring \ntrust between parties\
    \ along with not having to physically \nvisit any bank.\n4.4.3  Cash Transfer\n\
    Another proposal is to provide banking solutions to rural \nareas where a chit\
    \ fund system has been designed by Kumar \nand Sangal, [154]. Chit fund being\
    \ a traditional saving \nscheme in India is an easier way to have access to credit.\
    \ The \npurpose of this system is to remove geographical barriers \nFig. 18  Blockchain\

    \ Unlike other anonymous blockchain applica-\ntions, this system requires identity\
    \ registration. Unlike tradi-\ntional co-lateral systems, blockchain generates\
    \ credit history \nto prohibit manipulation. Lastly, Jaffer et al., [153] proposed\
    \ \na blockchain-based distributed system that is immutable and \nsecures the\
    \ transaction logs. The self-executing smart con-\ntracts were used to automatically\
    \ execute real-world con-\ntracts for auto disbursement of subsidies on meeting\
    \ spe-\ncific conditions. This system overcoming traditional cash \ntransfers,\
    \ and corruption and manipulation related to it can \nbenefit rural or deserving\
    \ people.\n4.5  Healthcare\nIn the healthcare sector, smart healthcare systems,\
    \ telemedi-\ncine, and privacy in medical data sharing to provide security \n\
    and transparency in the healthcare system between doctors \nand patients were\
    \ the commonly addressed areas in related \nwork (Fig. 18). A detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 11.\n4.5.1  Medical Data\nKaur et al., [157] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ electronic \nmedical record storage and management system. The pro-\nposed model\
    \ consisted of three main components: Domain \nexperts (doctors, lab technicians,\
    \ pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers), health insurance providers, and patients.\
    \ To \nensure the privacy of medical data which contains most of \nthe private\
    \ information blockchain distributed data storage \nfor heterogeneous data was\
    \ proposed having a single source \nfor data storage and access while providing\
    \ high security \nand privacy to the users and researchers. Similarly, Zhang \n\
    et al., [158] proposed secure and scalable clinical data shar-\ning using FHIR\
    \ Chain, a blockchain-based system meeting \nONC (office of the national coordinator\
    \ for health informa-\ntion technology) requirements. The technical requirements\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based clinical data sharing were verifying \nidentity and authenticating\
    \ all participants, Storing and \nexchanging data securely, consistent Permissioned\
    \ access \nto data sources, applying consistent data formats, maintain-\ning modularity.\
    \ FHIRChain facilitates clinical data exchange \nwhile maintaining ownership.\n\
    4.5.2  Telemedicine\nGuo et al., [161] proposed an ABE scheme to achieve \ndynamic\
    \ authentication and authorization with higher flex-\nibility and efficiency for\
    \ the Medical on Demand services \nin the telemedicine system. The system uses\
    \ a Consor-\ntium Blockchain managed by multiple authorities. Medi-\ncal examinations\
    \ are uploaded to the database provided \nby Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The\
    \ medical results are \ndownloadable from Cloud only by Medical specialists. All\
    \ \nthe data is stored in Blocks of Blockchain hence prevent-\ning any manipulation\
    \ in health records. Through this system \nindependence of choice should be provided\
    \ to the patient \nwhether they want to enroll, leave, or change access poli-\n\
    cies. Nusrat et al., [160] proposed a model of a telemedicine \nsystem for medical\
    \ care and security of data of rural people \nby using blockchain technology.\
    \ The system consisted of sta-\ntions for primary treatment tests while storing\
    \ data directly \nin the blockchain. This system ensured communication and \n\
    data privacy to doctors and patients while also giving reli-\nable medical care\
    \ and benefits to underserved (rural) people.\nForbye, Yong et al., [159] have\
    \ proposed a blockchain \nand machine learning system for vaccine supply chain\
    \ trace-\nability. The novel intelligent system based on the blockchain \ncan\
    \ be used for vaccine supervision in the vaccine supply \nchain. Additionally,\
    \ using smart contracts for the vaccine \nsupply chain can provide the following\
    \ advantages: detection \nof expired vaccines, vaccine information, and vaccine\
    \ coin.\n4.5.3  Smart Healthcare System\nMachine Learning holds the power to change\
    \ the perception \nof understanding and analyzing data and decision-making in\
    \ \nmultifarious sectors. Since, the blockchain with its decen-\ntralized network\
    \ focus on secure data sharing, its integration \nwith machine learning would\
    \ provide a very meticulous out-\ncome. Few of the ways through which blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with machine learning and benefit the healthcare system \nare\
    \ [162]:\n(a) Blockchain ledger with legitimate data collection can \nfeed the\
    \ machine learning models with highly accurate \nand dependable data.\n(b) Real\
    \ data can be used to train machine learning models \nto increase efficiency and\
    \ precision, therefore, saving \ncost and time.\n(c) Models can be trained to\
    \ give the same health advice \nto multiple patients with alike symptoms.\n(d)\
    \ Models can also be trained to give better clinical solu-\ntions to doctors based\
    \ on the patient’s symptoms.\n(e) Training the models on the patient history and\
    \ storing \nthem on blockchain ledger can predict outbreaks.\nFor implementing\
    \ the integration, Jain et al., [156] pro-\nposed an integrated model of blockchain\
    \ and machine learn-\ning to detect diseases. These models can be implemented\
    \ \nin a hospital or rural medical camps. The proposed system \nconsisted of IoT,\
    \ blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine \nlearning. Various components measure\
    \ basic parameters of \nthe human body such as weight, pulse, blood pressure,\
    \ and \nautomatically saved the data in the ledger. The system has \nthe potential\
    \ to expand medical parameters while making it \n2456\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\nadaptive. The complete system can collect, store, and ana-\nlyze the\
    \ data of the patient and benefit the doctors, patients, \nand medical institutions.\n\
    Similarly, Tripathi et al., [155] have proposed a safe and \nconvenient use of\
    \ medical data and its user through block-\nchain technology. The proposed work\
    \ is an improvement \non issues and challenges faced regarding security and pri-\n\
    vacy. The clinical data are recorded in the blockchain ledger \nwith access to\
    \ legitimate users only. For a doctor to access \na patient’s data a request has\
    \ to be made and only when \nthe patient approves the request does the data become\
    \ vis-\nible. The goal of this model is to provide secure and reliable \nservices\
    \ to insurance companies, drug supply chains, and \nmedical researchers. Lastly.\n\
    4.6  Employment\nThis application area mainly focused on employment vis-\nibility\
    \ and temporary employment for rural job security \n(Fig. 19). Therefore, the\
    \ following related research articles \nwere identified and a detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 12.\n4.6.1  Temporary Employment\nPinna and Ibba, [163] proposed\
    \ a decentralized employment \nsystem to process employment contracts with a fully\
    \ auto-\nmated and fast procedure. The model consists of a new job \noffer event\
    \ in which awaiting employers apply for jobs, an \napplication event where a smart\
    \ contract acquires the appli-\ncation request, a hiring event where the applicant\
    \ worker \nmeets the employer, a relationship event to enable the work-\ners to\
    \ check working situation and details, the workday event \nwhich describes the\
    \ maturation of workdays, a payment \nevent where the employee gets paid. The\
    \ transparent ledger \ncan make sure that the employment contracts were deployed\
    \ \nwith unchangeable information.\n4.6.2  Employment Visibility\nSimilarly, the\
    \ paper’s proposal by M. et al., [164] ensures \nsupply chain visibility to seamlessly\
    \ connect all stakeholders \nof the supply chain network who are a part of the\
    \ Blockchain \necosystem. The paper defined two modules in BC design: the \nSupply\
    \ module and the demand module. Supply module to \ncollect worker's data and smart\
    \ contracts to perform transac-\ntions through an application interface and store\
    \ them on the \nledger. Demand module to implement job allocation. The \naggregators\
    \ are given direct access to help track worker’s \ninformation from the ledger.\n\
    4.7  Existing Systematic Literature Reviews\nA tabular representation of a few\
    \ major existing works of \nblockchain in rural development has been done in Table 13.\
    \ \nThis table communicates the area of literature reviews, and \ntheir main contributions\
    \ in the review regarding blockchain \nin rural or agriculture.\nAn extensive\
    \ literature review was done in this section \nwhich portrayed the enormous amount\
    \ of work done in \nblockchain technology pertaining to rural development. All\
    \ \nthe functional areas and sub-areas were compared and dis-\ncussed in tabular\
    \ form. Multiple novel ideas and theories \nwere identified during the literature\
    \ review. At last, a small \ntabular representation was made for the existing\
    \ systematic \nliterature reviews and surveys in a similar area to identify the\
    \ \ndepth of the work done. In the upcoming sections, critical \nanalysis and\
    \ detailed discussion have been done based on \nthe literature study, followed\
    \ by the limitations of the survey \nand conclusion.\nFig. 19  Blockchain applications\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n5  Critical Analysis Existing Technologies \nand Discussion\n\
    Blockchain Technology possesses much competence and \nfuturistic hold towards\
    \ rural development. In this review, \nall possible applications of blockchain\
    \ that facilitated rural \ndevelopment were found, reviewed, compared, and summa-\n\
    rized. With Agriculture being the predominant application \nof blockchain, various\
    \ areas under it were analyzed that \nworked on the relief of agricultural issues\
    \ in rural areas.\nStarting with Supply chain traceability, the study showed \n\
    integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things \n[51, 54, 56, 58,\
    \ 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, 76, 82, 84, 85, 89, 100, \n145], Cloud computing [65, 87],\
    \ Big Data [87], and Geo-\nspatial Technology [100]. Among the papers discussed,\
    \ this \narea consisted of papers pertinent to tracing agricultural \nproduce\
    \ from the beginning of the process till it reached \nthe consumer. The range\
    \ of traceability options comprised \nall agricultural products as well as specifically\
    \ certain prod-\nucts such as soybean [60], grape wine [69], and cocoa beans \n\
    [62]. Furthermore, blockchain’s integration with IoT pro-\nvided sensing and sharing\
    \ of private data with blockchain \nwithout intermediary support. Additionally,\
    \ some proposed \nwork used QR codes [56, 60, 146] for viewing data directly \n\
    related to the attached product. Articles supporting IoT \ndevices were implemented\
    \ for tracing agricultural produce, \nencouraging circular economy, fault-tolerant,\
    \ and immutable \nAPIs. A few were reviews on agriculture traceability [53, \n\
    58, 60, 61] barriers [67], challenges [59, 71, 76] contribu-\ntion [80], IoT based\
    \ solutions, and future scopes [78, 96]. \nSome agricultural prototypes included\
    \ AgriBlockIoT [70], \nKHET [83], and FARMAR [68]. A few land record manage-\n\
    ment articles were also discussed that implied security and \nbroker-free methods\
    \ for land titling and transferring [97, 98]. \nMost of the platforms used were\
    \ Ethereum Smart Contracts, \nHyperledger, REST, JavaScript (Web3, node, angular),\
    \ Truf-\nfle Framework APIs, and MySQL and MongoDB for cloud \nstorage.\nWhile\
    \ traceability of agricultural produce is important, \nthe agriculture security\
    \ system is also a necessity. In this \nreview, the articles for agriculture security\
    \ systems included \nprevention of farm data from cyber-attacks using IoT [103]\
    \ \nand supervision of agricultural products and food informa-\ntion [102]. In\
    \ both the works acquired, it used Smart con-\ntracts and Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ respectively, along with \nIoT-based sensors for farm monitoring.\nOrganic Farming\
    \ as a part of agriculture application for \nsustainable farming and quality food\
    \ production included \ntwo articles for analyzing the effectiveness of supply\
    \ chain \n[101], and identifying product quality and transparency of \norganic\
    \ food supply chain using decentralized applications \nand QR codes for tracing\
    \ product data [104].\nTable 12  Comparison of blockchain applications in Employment\n\

    \ chain.\nSimilarly, to share informative farming data and tech-\nniques a review\
    \ on convenience analysis of the blockchain \nin agriculture [116], and exploratory\
    \ data planning and \nmanagement of agricultural food supply chain for sustain-\n\
    able development [117] was given to explore the work done \nin E-agriculture using\
    \ blockchain technology. Since one \nof the main motives towards implementing\
    \ blockchain in \nagriculture is to monitor the faring process and products \n\
    till it reaches the consumer, therefore, agriculture monitor-\ning section covered\
    \ farm monitoring system[99], a yield \nestimation system to share farming plans\
    \ implemented on \nsmart contracts [119], and an IoT based AG Wallet system to\
    \ \ntrack farm activity implemented using IBM enterprise block-\nchain platform\
    \ [118]. Penultimately, the application area was \ndivided into farmer Sect. 3.1.9\
    \ where blockchain’s reviews \nto facilitate farmers such as farmer’s portal to\
    \ capture farm \nactivities using HTML and Python [121], farmer’s data stor-\n\
    age to provide transparency for government scheme using \nsmart contracts [120],\
    \ and farmer’s data accessing using \ntheir consent [122] were discussed.\nLastly,\
    \ an overall blockchain application area covering the \nuse of incentives for\
    \ numerous activities was discussed in \nSect. 3.1.10. The review included a reward-based\
    \ system in \nreturn for solid waste [148], rural waste [128], anonymously \n\
    reporting an activity [130], reporting an accident [127], stor-\ning educational\
    \ records in ledger [132], green behavior [123, \n124], geotagging litters [125],\
    \ and to safely share medical \ndata [126]. The incentive mechanism works when\
    \ an activ-\nity is performed, therefore in return for good behaviors or \nactivity,\
    \ cryptocurrency-based tokens are rewarded that can \nbe stored in a blockchain\
    \ wallet. Most of the platforms used \nwere smart contracts while some of the\
    \ systems also used \nARK Blockchain, Laravel PHP, and JavaScript.\nLooking through\
    \ the applications of blockchain in rural \nareas, usage of blockchain in reinforcing\
    \ environmental \nconditions and changing people's outlook on preserving the \n\
    environment was the outcome of factors affecting rural peo-\nple as they were\
    \ much likely also related to environmental \nconditions. From this view, the\
    \ environmental application \nareas were discovered and discussed to be Water\
    \ manage-\nment, Waste management, and Natural hazards.\nTo begin with, under\
    \ Sect. 3.2.3 water management, \nsmart measuring and monitoring [137], smart\
    \ consump-\ntion [135], management [139], and control system [136] \nof water\
    \ were discussed. These articles provided smart \nways of implementing blockchain\
    \ for efficient use of water \nin irrigation, distribution, and consumption, preventing\

    \ system in return for waste collection and selling \n[128, 148], and waste management\
    \ [133] using Blockchain \nTechnology were discussed. Covered under the integration\
    \ \nof Blockchain Technology, Cloud Computing, and IoT, the \nimplementation used\
    \ smart contracts in the first two propos-\nals and UML, TLA + for the latter.\n\
    Lastly, as per the research criteria, only one article con-\ntributing to the\
    \ environment and natural hazards was dis-\ncovered and reviewed explaining the\
    \ insurance system for \ndrought-affected farms based on the farm data stored\
    \ in the \nblockchain ledger [134]. The model was implemented on \nNEO virtual\
    \ machine, smart contracts, and used Oracle \nserver as database.\nSimilarly,\
    \ from the challenges faced by rural people \nacquiring an electric line, energy-efficient\
    \ methods, to \nsecure, and transparent payments issues were covered and \nreviewed\
    \ under the energy section. The blockchain applica-\ntion areas in the energy\
    \ sector were discovered to be Renew-\nable energy and the Energy grid. With blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with renewable energy a smart contract-based energy \ntransfer\
    \ credibility system of biomass energy grid [143], \nand a case study of sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa and its challenges \nand adoption of renewable energy access were discussed\
    \ \n[142]. Whereas in the energy grid section, the blockchain’s \napplication\
    \ in providing peer-to-peer electrification with \nsecure payments, transparent\
    \ energy usage [144], and the \nuse of smart energy grids for farming and irrigation\
    \ using \nEthereum Blockchain [140] were reviewed.\nBesides, from the traditional\
    \ use of blockchain in Finance, \nthe banking solutions for rural people were\
    \ discussed in \nSect. 3.4. From the banking applications of blockchain, the \n\
    use of mobile money for semi-offline payments in sub-Saha-\nran Africa without\
    \ identity proof using a secure, interoper-\nable mobile money system [149], and\
    \ a delay-tolerant digital \npayment system based on Ethereum blockchain [150]\
    \ were \ndiscussed. A simpler way of getting a loan with the help \nof blockchain\
    \ is by using a hyper ledger fabric-based Loan \nOn Blockchain(LOC) system using\
    \ smart contracts [151], \nand a credit scoring system called Bit-score using\
    \ Ethereum \nBlockchain [152] were discussed. Finally, a Cash Transfer \narea\
    \ where a distributed system for automatic subsidy deliv-\nery and fund release\
    \ using JavaScript and Hyperledger com-\nposer [153], and a chit fund system based\
    \ on smart contracts \nto provide credit to rural people [154] were reviewed.\n\
    Under the Healthcare applications of blockchain, A Smart \nHealthcare System,\
    \ Medical Data sharing, and Telemedi-\ncine were the areas discovered. Under smart\
    \ healthcare, the \narticles reviewed were a smart model to detect diseases and\
    \ \nmeasure basic health parameters using Ethereum blockchain \nand Raspberry\
    \ Pi [156] and protected access to medical \ndata using smart contracts [155].\
    \ For the recordkeeping of \nmedical data and share it legitimately an electronic\
    \ medi-\ncal record storage management system based on ethereum \nand cloud storage\
    \ [157], and a permissioned clinical data \nsharing called FHIRChain using smart\
    \ contracts [158] was \nreviewed. Lastly, under Telemedicine, vaccine supervision\
    \ \nand traceability for safe vaccine supply [159], secure data \nstorage using\
    \ telemedicine system based on smart contracts \n[160], and a telemedicine system\
    \ to prevent health records \nmanipulation using Blockchain and Cloud Database\
    \ [161] \nwere the articles reviewed.\nAnother challenge faced by rural people\
    \ implemented to \nrecuperate from unemployment using blockchain technol-\nogy\
    \ was discussed in Sect. 3.6. Using smart contracts an \nemployment contracts\
    \ processing, handling, and safe pay-\nment system for temporary employment contracts\
    \ [163], and \na blockchain aggregator to perform worker data transactions \n\
    and employment visibility [164] were the works reviewed \nin this section.\n5.1\
    \  Limitations of Existing Works and Research \nGaps\nIn this section, the limitations\
    \ of the existing literature \nreview on blockchain in rural development along\
    \ with \na comparison of existing systematic literature reviews \nhave been discussed.\
    \ The comparison has been shown in \nTable 14, and a few research gaps have been\
    \ mentioned in \nthis section as well.\nWhile Blockchain technology is leading\
    \ in security and \ntransparency, providing ways of applying its technology in\
    \ \ndisparate areas its limitations and gaps can still be identi-\nfied in the\
    \ proposed and implemented work. While most \nof the work in agriculture is for\
    \ ensuring transparency and \ntraceability in the supply chain, there are far\
    \ more factors in \nagriculture that affect farmers and crops. Blockchain inevi-\n\
    tably uses excessive energy in execution, but its execution in \nrural areas may\
    \ become worrisome due to the lack of energy \nand load in those areas.\nCollecting\
    \ farm data and storing them on the ledger in \nsmall farms is easier. However,\
    \ in the case of big farms, the \ndata collection and integration may consume\
    \ much time and \nprobably manpower in accumulating and loading it in the \nledger.\
    \ Apart from that, IoT-based services require sensors \nas well as collecting\
    \ livestock DNA to trace them and load \ntheir information may cost a fortune\
    \ to small-scale farmers.\nTeaching the application usage to laymen, that too\
    \ unedu-\ncated farmers or rural people may become a troubling task. \nNot only\
    \ that, the availability of news of the latest technolo-\ngies is hardly accessible\
    \ to underdeveloped countries, intro-\nducing blockchain-based applications to\
    \ those areas may toil \nthe deployment and utilization.\n2460\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\

    \ easier and \npeople technologically advanced.\n5.2  Discussion\nMultiple issues\
    \ pertaining to rural areas have been addressed \nby authors with the help of\
    \ blockchain. Agriculture is the \nmost economic factor, solutions for blockchain-based\
    \ sup-\nply chain traceability provided secure, transparent, beneficial \nproduct\
    \ delivery. It also ensured timely payments to farm-\ners and quality products\
    \ to consumers. Banking solutions \nhave also been made easier with blockchain\
    \ technology, pro-\nviding remote banking solutions, credit and loan easiness,\
    \ \nand easy and transparent banking. Hygiene issues that led \nto many diseases,\
    \ generational disabilities have also been \ngiven a solution through blockchain\
    \ which also incentivizes \nrural people for participating in waste and water\
    \ manage-\nment. Rural electrification solutions were also proposed with \nblockchain\
    \ for people unable to obtain energy resources, \nbasic electrical amenities,\
    \ and expensive bills. People who \nwere unable to receive treatments, had to\
    \ travel long dis-\ntances for medical assistance, were also provided a block-\n\
    chain solution with which telemedicine, privacy to medical \ndata usage, and medical-on-demand\
    \ were made available. \nBlockchain has also been useful in providing employment\
    \ \nsolutions to the truly underserved, using a global chain \nfor employment\
    \ visibility, and secure payment for jobs \n[168–172].\nThe Systematic Literature\
    \ Review’s objective is to pro-\nvide information on the research proposed related\
    \ to block-\nchain in rural development to provide new research oppor-\ntunities,\
    \ extensive knowledge about each development area, \nand the possibility for future\
    \ development in rural areas. \nAfter distinctly reviewing every research article\
    \ variant areas \nof applications were identified relating to the development\
    \ of \nFig. 20  Blockchain Applications and their Areas in rural development\n\
    2462\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nrural areas with the help of Blockchain Technology.\
    \ Overall, \n6 disparate applications in rural development were picked \nout;\
    \ from which each of these applications has a total of 23 \ndivergent areas combined.\
    \ These areas contribute to all the \nresearch that has been done in the blockchain\
    \ in the rural \ndevelopment sector and are distributed across 37 countries \n\
    obtained from 6 journals and 1 web source ranging from \nthe years 2010 to 2020.\
    \ After searching through journals, \napplying more than 16 keywords, 112 articles\
    \ were found in \naggregate. From analyzing each article, the primary applica-\n\
    tion of blockchain was identified as agriculture with 67% of \nresearch articles\
    \ relative to blockchain in agriculture whence \n60% were associated with supply\
    \ chain traceability. About \n55% of those papers were from the Institute of Electrical\
    \ and \nElectronics Engineers (IEEE). Furthermore, in 112 research \npapers, 8\
    \ technologies were implemented with a total of 58 \nplatforms and tools combined.\n\
    5.3  Research Questions Addressed\nFrom the Research Questions defined (Table 3),\
    \ the follow-\ning inference can be made:\nRQ1 What are the main applications\
    \ and areas of imple-\nmenting Blockchain Technology in Rural Development?\nVarious\
    \ extensively researched applications are defined \nin Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\
    \ 11 and 12. These applications \ndefine the Blockchain’s applications in rural\
    \ development \nthat impact the rural areas, provide security, opportunities,\
    \ \navailability of resources, and a better lifestyle. The areas \n(Fig. 20) gave\
    \ extensive knowledge about the domains of \napplication-defined from several\
    \ research articles related to \nit.\nRQ2 What are the major issues in Rural Development\
    \ and \nhow they can be addressed using Blockchain Technology?\nNumerous issues\
    \ in rural areas are explained in Sect. 1.1.1 \nand the blockchain applications\
    \ for the eradication of those \nissues are addressed in Sect. 3.\nRQ3 What are\
    \ the targeted software, platforms, and tools \nfor the implementation of blockchain\
    \ in rural development?\nThroughout the applications, for implementation follow-\n\
    ing (Table 15) technologies’ integration, and software and \nplatforms were used:\n\
    RQ4.  What are the research gaps and future research direc-\ntions for applying\
    \ blockchain technology to rural \ndevelopment?\nFollowing the review, in agriculture,\
    \ most emphases were \nstated towards supply chain traceability and less or no\
    \ work \nin natural resource management, overproduction, yield stag-\nnation,\
    \ and international trade. In regards to the sociological \nfactor, research on\
    \ work belonging to blockchain develop-\nment for rural education, housing, women\
    \ empowerment, \ncrime reduction, brain drain, and craftsmanship is missing. \n\
    For the implementation of banking, healthcare, and many \nother applications the\
    \ required government and technologi-\ncal assist are still lacking. In some cases,\
    \ the research pro-\nposed could be administered only in the far future, therefore\
    \ \ncontemporary work was absent. Some more gaps and future \nresearch directions\
    \ are given in Sects. 4.2 and 6.1.\nThe research questions mentioned in Table \
    \ 3 are \naddressed in the following section (Table 16):\n6  Threat to Validity\
    \ and Limitation \nof the Survey\nWhile reviewing the issues in rural areas, blockchain\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n2.3. During exclusion, some articles were not considered\
    \ fit \nfor this review, were missed, or were not found. Six appli-\ncations were\
    \ considered in this review, there could be more \napplications that we couldn’t\
    \ figure or that couldn’t make the \ncut of criteria. A total of 23 sub-areas\
    \ of all the applications \nwere determined. Conclusively, as per our knowledge,\
    \ there \nwasn’t any systematic review that reviewed all the applica-\ntion areas\
    \ of blockchain technology in rural and sustainable \ndevelopment nevertheless\
    \ there could have been a few rural \nand sustainable development articles that\
    \ weren’t included \nin this review.\n7  Conclusion and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ Technology has presented a considerable amount \nof work in the rural sector.\
    \ While its implementation was \nfew, the ideology is enough to motivate people\
    \ into changing \nthe lifestyle of rural people leading to the overall country’s\
    \ \ndevelopment. In this systematic literature review, numerous \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustainable rural \ndevelopment were discussed with\
    \ diverse areas in each \napplication. A comparative study of each application\
    \ in all \nthe areas pertaining to different approaches has been por-\ntrayed\
    \ with differing attributes elucidating the technology, \nprocess, and techniques\
    \ behind each article. The paper pro-\nvides extensive literature towards each\
    \ of the articles sorted \nafter applying the review process consisting of relevant\
    \ arti-\ncles and keywords. The primary findings of the systematic \nliterature\
    \ review were as follows:\n(a) From the review, we were able to identify common\
    \ and \nexceptional uses of blockchain technology that would \nhelp uplift the\
    \ rural community and lead to sustainable \nrural development.\n(b) Various distinct\
    \ approaches to implementing block-\nchain technology for rural welfare were discovered.\n\
    (c) Platforms and tools that would facilitate the use of these \napplications\
    \ for farmers and uninstructed agrestic peo-\nple were identified and reviewed.\n\
    (d) Blockchain’s integration with multiple powerful tech-\nnologies for rural\
    \ development was reviewed.\n(e) An overall idea for a collaborative approach\
    \ leading to \na smart village framework was constructed.\nThe gaps determined\
    \ from reviewing the articles broadly \nwould help researchers explore additional\
    \ as well as alter-\nnative utilization of blockchain technology for sustainable\
    \ \nrural development.\n7.1  Future Work\nBlockchain’s characteristics are exceptionally\
    \ conducive to \nsafety, privacy, integrity, traceability, efficiency, and trans-\n\
    parency in every area limited by such advantages. While \ndiverse blockchain applications\
    \ for the welfare of rural \ncommunity has been discussed nevertheless future\
    \ work \ncan comprise of facilitating applications in making use of \nblockchain\
    \ incentives for a collaborative framework incor-\nporating several services in\
    \ rural areas namely Smart Vil-\nlage. Blockchain technology in terms of providing\
    \ incentive \nmechanisms could lead to a better motivational unit in many \nareas.\
    \ Incentivizing rural or urban people for education, data \nsharing, green farming,\
    \ green behavior, and environment \nconservation are real future demands. Apart\
    \ from empha-\nsizing rural areas, blockchain’s integration with network-\ning,\
    \ cybersecurity, and digital advertising is also a future \ninsistence.\nFunding\

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Shah Alam, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture represents a crucial sector that underpins our population growth and
    well-being. It has been providing nourishment for generations. The agricultural
    sector faces numerous challenges, including climate change, insufficient agricultural
    land, growing population, biodiversity loss, and low investment in agriculture
    [1], Farmers must cope with climate change, soil erosion, and biodiversity loss,
    satisfy consumers’ changing tastes and expectations, and meet rising demand for
    more food of higher quality [2], The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
    Development (OECD) emphasizes the three key challenges facing agriculture: feeding
    a growing population, providing a livelihood for farmers, and protecting the environment
    [3], Global threats to agriculture include climate change, depleted resources,
    and soil erosion, which negatively impact the industry and overall food security
    [4], The loss of agricultural land through erosion and manmade factors is one
    of the large problems facing agriculture [5], The World Bank addresses key issues
    in agriculture, including the lack of access to adequate food for a significant
    portion of the world’s population, the need to fight climate change, and the importance
    of digital transformation in the agrifood system [6], Table 1 summarizes the challenges
    facing agriculture: Table 1 Agriculture Challenges These challenges require innovative
    solutions to ensure sustainable productivity growth to feed a growing world population
    in a changing climate, while simultaneously reducing the sector’s greenhouse gas
    emissions. The agriculture sector needs to embrace innovative technologies such
    as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) to navigate these challenges and embrace
    the opportunities of the future [7][8][9][10]. AIoT is a combination of artificial
    intelligence (Al) technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure.
    AIoT can be used in agriculture to optimize resource utilization, improve production
    management and productivity, and reduce labor dependency [11], SECTION II. Literature
    Review A. What is AIoT? AIoT is a rapidly growing technology that combines the
    power of Al with the connectivity of IoT to create a powerful tool for agricultural
    transformation. Al can analyze large amounts of data from IoT sensors to identify
    patterns and trends that can help farmers make better decisions. For instance,
    Al can be used to monitor crop health, identify pests and diseases, and optimize
    irrigation schedules. Recent advancements in AIoT applications for precision agriculture
    have been discussed in several research papers [7] [8] [12], These papers highlight
    the current progress, applications, and advantages of AIoT in agriculture, including
    optimizing resource utilization, improving production management and productivity,
    and reducing labor dependency. The adoption of AIoT technology significantly transforms
    the traditional agriculture scenario by addressing numerous challenges, including
    pest management and post-harvest management issues [8] [11], However, there are
    still some barriers that need to be overcome, such as the cost factors and the
    adaptation to traditional agricultural practices [8], An AIoT-based smart agricultural
    system for pests’ detection has been proposed in a research paper [13], This system
    notifies farmers of the presence of different pests before they start multiplying
    in large numbers. B. Benefits of AIoT in agriculture AIoT in agriculture offers
    various benefits, including increased efficiency and productivity, reduced labor
    dependency, improved decision-making, and increased sustainability as shown in
    Figure 1. Increase efficiency and productivity. AIoT offers significant benefits
    to farmers by automating tasks such as crop monitoring and irrigation. This automation
    frees up farmers’ time, allowing them to focus on other important activities.
    By utilizing AIoT technologies, farmers can access real-time data on crop health,
    soil moisture, and other relevant factors. This information assists them in making
    more informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and harvesting [7] [8][11],
    For example, Precision Hawk employs AIoT in conjunction with drones to monitor
    crops. Drones collect data on crop health and soil moisture, which is then analyzed
    by AIoT algorithms. The analyzed data is transformed into detailed maps of crop
    fields, enabling farmers to identify areas that require additional attention [14],
    According to a recent study conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute, the implementation
    of Al in agriculture could potentially increase productivity by 70{%} by the year
    2050. This increase in productivity would be instrumental in meeting the food
    demands of a growing global population. Reduce labor dependency:AI-powered robots
    are already being used for tasks like weeding and harvesting. As these robots
    become more sophisticated, they could potentially replace human labor on many
    farms. This could result in job losses in the agricultural sector, but also help
    reduce the cost of food production and save farmers time and money. For example,
    FarmBot sells robotic farming systems that can automate tasks like planting, watering,
    and weeding crops. The systems are controlled via a smartphone or tablet and can
    be programmed to follow specific instructions [8][11][15][16][17], Improve decision-making:AIoT
    can help farmers make better decisions about crop planting, irrigation, and pest
    control by analyzing real-time data from sensors and other IoT devices. This information
    can be used to identify potential problems early on, such as pests or diseases,
    and to take corrective action before they cause significant damage. For example,
    CropMetrics uses AIoT to monitor crops for pests and diseases. The company’s sensors
    collect data on crop health, soil moisture, and other factors, which is then analyzed
    by AIoT algorithms. This information is used to create alerts when there is a
    potential problem, such as the presence of a pest or disease [8][11][13][18],
    Enhance sustainability. AIoT in agriculture can help farmers reduce their environmental
    impact by optimizing resource use and minimizing waste. For instance, AIoT can
    be used to monitor water usage and adjust irrigation schedules accordingly, which
    can help to reduce water waste and improve crop yields. WaterBit is a company
    that sells IoT-enabled water monitoring systems that can be used to track water
    usage in agricultural settings [19], Fig. 1. Benefits of AIoT in Agriculture Show
    All C. Opportunities of AIoT in agriculture AIoT presents various opportunities
    to enhance productivity, sustainability, and decision-making in agriculture (Figure
    2). Precision Farming:AIoT enables precise monitoring and management of crops,
    resulting in optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields. For example,
    AIoT systems can analyze real-time data on soil moisture, weather conditions,
    and crop health to provide precise recommendations for irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [11]. Predictive analytics:Leveraging Al algorithms, AIoT can
    analyze historical and real-time data to generate predictive insights. This helps
    farmers to predict crop diseases, pest outbreaks or weather conditions. For example,
    AIoT can predict the occurrence of diseases based on environmental conditions,
    enabling farmers to take timely preventive measures [8]. Autonomous Farming:AIoT
    can enable autonomous farming operations through the use of autonomous vehicles,
    robots, and drones. Tasks such as planting, spraying and harvesting can be carried
    out precisely and efficiently with these devices. For example, Al-powered drones
    can monitor crop health and identify areas that need attention or apply targeted
    treatments [20]. Resource optimization:AIoT systems can optimize the use of resources
    such as water, fertilizers and energy. By analyzing data from sensors and environmental
    factors, AIoT can provide insights into resource allocation, reduce waste and
    improve sustainability. For example, AIoT can optimize irrigation schedules based
    on soil moisture levels and weather forecasts, saving water while maintaining
    crop health [11] [21]. Supply chain efficiency:AIoT can improve agricultural supply
    chain efficiency by providing real-time data and insights. This includes monitoring
    and tracking products, optimizing transport routes and managing inventory. For
    example, AIoT can provide real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity during
    storage and transportation, ensuring the quality and freshness of agricultural
    products [20]. Decision support systems:AIoT can provide farmers with decision
    support systems that provide actionable insights and recommendations. By analyzing
    data from multiple sources, including weather forecasts, market trends, and harvest
    data, AIoT systems can help farmers make informed decisions about planting, harvesting,
    and marketing strategies [8]. These possibilities highlight the potential of AIoT
    to revolutionize agriculture by improving productivity, sustainability and decision-making.
    By harnessing the power of Al and IoT technologies, farmers can optimize resource
    use, reduce costs and increase overall efficiency on farms. Fig. 2. Opportunities
    of AIoT in agriculture Show All D. Challenges of AIoT in agriculture While AIoT
    promises substantial benefits and opportunities for agriculture, its implementation
    presents certain challenges (Figure 3). Data Quality and Integration:AIoT in agriculture
    relies on collecting and analyzing large amounts of data from various sources
    such as sensors, drones, and satellite imagery. Ensuring the quality, accuracy,
    and compatibility of diverse data sets can be challenging. For example, integrating
    data from different types of sensors or ensuring the consistency of data collected
    over time can pose difficulties [22]. Connectivity and Infrastructure:AIoT systems
    require robust and reliable connectivity to transmit data in realtime. However,
    many agricultural areas lack adequate network coverage and internet connectivity.
    This can hinder the seamless functioning of AIoT systems and limit their effectiveness.
    Limited infrastructure can also be a challenge, particularly in rural or remote
    regions [23][24]. Cost and Affordability:Implementing AIoT solutions can involve
    significant costs. Acquiring and deploying the necessary hardware, sensors, and
    IoT devices, as well as setting up the required infrastructure, can be expensive.
    For small-scale or resource-constrained farmers, the upfront costs and ongoing
    maintenance expenses may pose financial challenges [25]. Data Privacy and Security:AIoT
    systems collect and process sensitive data related to crop health, soil conditions,
    and other farm-related information. Ensuring data privacy and protecting against
    cyber threats are critical challenges. Unauthorized access, data breaches, or
    misuse of personal and agricultural data could have serious consequences for farmers
    and the entire agriculture industry [26][27]. Adoption and User Training:Introducing
    AIoT technologies requires farmers and agricultural workers to adapt to new tools
    and processes. Some farmers may face challenges in understanding and utilizing
    AIoT solutions effectively. Training and education programs are essential to ensure
    farmers have the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage AIoT technologies
    optimally [28][29][30]. Interoperability and Standards:AIoT systems often involve
    multiple devices, platforms, and software from different manufacturers and providers.
    Ensuring interoperability and standardization among these systems can be complex.
    Lack of compatibility and standard protocols may limit the seamless integration
    and exchange of data between different components of AIoT solutions [31][32].
    Addressing these challenges is crucial to fully harness the potential of AIoT
    in agriculture and maximize its benefits for farmers and the industry as a whole.

    PDF 1 Introduction Food security is a crucial global problem affecting billions
    of people worldwide. Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
    of the United Nations (FAO) as “when all people, at all times, have physical,
    social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their
    dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (Cudjoe et
    al. 2021). Despite tremendous improvements in recent decades, food security remains
    a key concern, especially in developing nations and among vulnerable people (Keesstra
    et al. 2016). The world’s population continues to rise, placing enormous strain
    on agricultural systems to produce enough food to feed everyone effectively. Weather
    patterns that are erratic, severe occurrences, and changing climatic circumstances
    significantly influence agricultural production, resulting in crop failures, lower
    yields, and food shortages (Nathan and Joel Uche 2023; Oseni and Masarirambi 2011).
    Soil erosion, deforestation, and degradation of arable land endanger agricultural
    production and restrict cultivable land availability. Water shortage in many locations
    impedes irrigation and farming practices, resulting in water stress and lower
    crop yields. Much of the world’s food supply is lost or squandered at different
    points throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption, aggravating
    food poverty (Khanna, 2018). Sustainable agriculture is an important strategy
    for addressing global food security concerns while minimizing negative environmental
    consequences. Sustainable agriculture seeks to increase production, protect natural
    resources, promote ecological balance, and assure farmers’ economic viability
    (Herzberg et al. 2022). It entails putting practices that promote long-term food
    production in place while neither depleting resources nor damaging the environment
    (Abubakar 2021). The AIoT has emerged as a disruptive technology with enormous
    promise to revolutionise the agriculture industry in recent years. The AIoT is
    a network of networked devices with sensors, software, and data analytics capabilities
    that gather and share data via the Internet. AIoT may be used in agriculture to
    monitor and manage different elements of farming, such as crop health, irrigation,
    pest control, and animal management (Saad et al. 2023). Furthermore, recision
    farming is made possible by AIoT-enabled sensors and data analytics, which allow
    farmers to monitor and optimise inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides,
    resulting in higher efficiency and decreased resource waste (Giuffrida et al.
    2022). Weather forecasting and monitoring powered by AIoT assist farmers in adapting
    to changing weather patterns, mitigating risks, and making educated crop management
    choices. AIoT enables farmers to monitor their crops and animals from afar remotely,
    increasing output and minimising the requirement for personal presence (Kemmoe
    et al. 2022). AIoT applications in the food supply chain increase traceability,
    minimize food loss, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. AIoT technologies
    improve efficiency and solve problems in agriculture and food supply systems.
    Food security and sustainable agriculture need precision farming, smart irrigation,
    livestock monitoring, supply chain traceability, climate resilience, data-driven
    decision-making, and sustainable resource management (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022).
    The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015
    to address worldwide social, economic, and environmental challenges. These 17
    global objectives provide a comprehensive framework for promoting sustainable
    development and improving people’s well-being. They cover various issues such
    as poverty eradication, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water,
    sanitation, affordable energy, decent work, industry, innovation, climate action,
    life below water, life on land, peace and justice, and strong institutions (Kalu
    et al. 2021). The SDGs emphasize collaboration among governments, businesses,
    civil society, and individuals to achieve sustainable development. By 2030, the
    SDGs aim to end poverty, hunger, inequality, access to quality education and healthcare,
    promote sustainable economic growth, combat climate change, and protect biodiversity
    (Erin and Bamigboye 2022). Implementing the SDGs requires political commitment,
    adequate resources, and effective policies. Governments play a crucial role in
    setting national priorities, aligning policies with the SDGs, and mobilizing financial
    resources. Businesses are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, invest in
    innovation, and contribute to the achievement of the goals (Khan et al. 2022).
    In conclusion, the SDGs represent a global roadmap for creating a more sustainable
    and equitable future for all, addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality,
    and environmental degradation. Achieving the SDGs requires collective efforts
    and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. The study’s research goal is
    to look at the role of AIoT in promoting sustainable agriculture and tackling
    food security issues. The research will examine the possible advantages and drawbacks
    of AIoT applications in agriculture, such as crop management, water conservation,
    animal monitoring, and supply chain management. The study will thoroughly examine
    current literature, case studies, and real-world deployments of AIoT solutions
    in agriculture. It will concentrate on the influence of AIoT on agricultural production,
    resource efficiency, and climate change resistance. In addition, the research
    will look at the problems and hurdles to AIoT adoption in agriculture, policy
    implications, and future trends. Overall, this study aims to improve knowledge
    of how AIoT may play an important role in promoting sustainable agriculture and
    maintaining food security in a fast-changing world. The study seeks to give significant
    insights for policymakers, academics, and stakeholders to make informed choices
    and build strategies for sustainable agricultural growth by highlighting the prospects
    and difficulties of AIoT adoption in agriculture. This chapter is arranged into
    nine different sections. In Sect. 2, the related works are discussed in detail.
    The research on AIoT applications in sustainable agriculture is presented in detail
    in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides a discussion on AIoT in food supply chain management.
    Section 5 provides the challenges and barriers. Section 6 discusses the policy
    and regulatory considerations. Section 7 provides the Case Studies and real-world
    implementations as well as future trends and innovations are provided in Sect.
    8. Finally, Sect. 9 concludes the study. 2 Literature Review Climate change, water
    shortages, and the need for effective resource management are just a few of the
    many obstacles that agriculture must overcome to ensure the world''s food supply.
    The AIoT has emerged as a potent tool to overcome these obstacles and improve
    agriculture’s long-term viability (Praveen et al. 2021). AIoT systems use sensors,
    data analytics, and real-time connectivity to monitor and optimize agricultural
    operations for higher yields, lower resource waste, and safer food supplies (Nwankwoala
    and Okujagu 2021). This section examines current AIoT technologies for sustainable
    agriculture and food security. Using sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature,
    nutrient levels, and crop health is at the heart of precision farming, a prominent
    use in agriculture. More informed choices about watering, fertilizing, and controlling
    pests may be made by farmers thanks to this information (Sohel et al. 2022). With
    real-time data from weather stations and soil moisture sensors, AIoT-enabled smart
    irrigation systems can fine-tune watering schedules to meet the precise needs
    of individual crops. These methods help farmers save water and irrigate their
    crops more efficiently, especially in arid areas (Farooq et al. 2022). AIoT devices
    with sensors and GPS may track cattle and monitor their well-being and habits.
    Better livestock management and greater food production result from using livestock
    monitoring tools that assist farmers in identifying health problems early, optimizing
    feeding patterns and enhancing breeding practices (Eze et al. 2022). Due to AIoT-based
    supply chain traceability systems, food goods may be tracked and monitored in
    real-time through the supply chain. These methods improve visibility and tracking,
    safeguarding against food fraud and keeping consumers secure (Farooq et al. 2022;
    Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Weather patterns, temperature, and humidity data are
    gathered via AIoT-based weather stations and environmental sensors, which are
    then used for climate monitoring and prediction (Al-otaibi 2022). This information
    is utilized to foresee the effects of climate change and harsh weather on crops,
    allowing farmers to make necessary preparations in advance. To keep tabs on pest
    populations in farms, AIoT systems have integrated pest monitoring sensors and
    data analytics. As stated by (Zhao et al. 2022), pests may be managed more sustainably
    and with less reliance on chemical pesticides if their presence is identified
    sufficiently soon. Automated and optimized nutrition and water management is achieved
    via integrating AIoT technology into aquaponics and hydroponics systems. These
    methods allow for year-round farming, reduce water use, and boost the long-term
    viability of fish and vegetable harvests (Yoon 2020). Data on crop health and
    stress may be gathered in real-time via remote sensing technologies like satellites
    and drones fitted with AIoT sensors. This data aids farmers in making early diagnoses
    of disease and nutritional deficits, which leads to more focused treatments and
    fewer crop failures (Abdullahi et al. 2022). AIoT technologies use automated traps,
    drones, and AI for smart pest control (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). This allows for
    precise monitoring and managing of pest populations without harming the ecosystem.
    Indicators of soil health, such as pH, nutrient content, and organic matter, are
    tracked using AIoT sensors and devices. Producing crops sustainably and effectively
    requires this information to implement precision agricultural practices and enhance
    soil fertility (Mishra and Pandya 2021). As a result of optimizing resource utilization,
    increasing productivity, and raising the efficiency of food supply chains, AIoT
    technologies have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and solve food security
    concerns. Current AIoT solutions show how important technology is to attaining
    sustainable agriculture and meeting the needs of a rising global population. 3
    AIoT Applications in Sustainable Agriculture Global food security depends on agriculture,
    yet climate change, water shortages, and resource management pose concerns. The
    AIoT can solve these problems and improve agriculture’s sustainability. AIoT systems
    monitor and optimize agricultural processes using sensors, data analytics, and
    real-time connectivity, improving productivity, resource efficiency, and food
    security (Dibia and Nwaigwe 2017; Herzberg et al. 2022). For precision farming,
    AIoT sensors capture soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and crop health
    data. This data may help farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and insect
    management for better resource utilization and crop yields. Smart irrigation systems
    optimize watering schedules based on crop water needs using real-time data from
    weather stations and soil moisture sensors (Ambayea et al. 2022). Livestock monitoring
    systems enhance livestock management and food production by detecting health concerns
    early, optimizing feeding patterns, and improving breeding practices. Supply chain
    traceability systems reduce food fraud and ensure food safety by tracking and
    monitoring food goods in real-time (Oberlack et al. 2021). Farmers can modify
    their practices and safeguard their from bad weather using AIoT-based weather
    stations and environmental sensors. Data analytics and integrated pest monitoring
    devices reduce the demand for chemical pesticides and promote eco-friendly pest
    control (Awofeso and Odeyemi 2021). Aquaponics and hydroponics systems automate
    and optimise nutrition and water management, allowing year-round growing, decreased
    water use, and sustainable fish and vegetable production. Farmers need remote
    sensing for crop health and stress to identify illnesses and nutrient shortages
    early and cure them for maximum development and output (Norton 2016). Farmers
    may plan planting, irrigation, and pest management using weather forecasts and
    predictive analytics. Smart farming and precision agriculture improve crop quality,
    food safety, efficiency, sustainability, data-driven decision-making, labour,
    and time (Ambayea et al. 2022; Voora et al. 2022). However, early investment expenditures,
    data privacy and security issues, and farmers’ technical knowledge are obstacles.
    Smart farming may be vital to global food security and environmental sustainability
    as technology advances. Thus, components of precision agriculture are illustrated
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The components of precision agriculture (Herzberg et al. 2022)
    Full size image 3.1 Smart Irrigation and Water Management Smart irrigation is
    a cutting-edge technique for managing water in agriculture. It allows farmers
    to save water without sacrificing yield. Smart irrigation systems reduce water
    waste while supplying water reliably to crops depending on individual demands,
    local weather, and other data collected from various sensors and AIoT devices
    (Raghuvanshi et al. 2022). Agriculture uses a lot of water, so finding ways to
    save and reuse that water is essential. Smart irrigation systems determine when
    and how much water should be supplied to crops by monitoring soil moisture and
    evapotranspiration rates (Zhang, Xu et al. 2022b). Smart agricultural practices,
    such as drip irrigation and controlled watering systems, are increasingly used
    to reduce water waste from evaporation and runoff. This technology allows farmers
    to minimize labor by remotely controlling irrigation cycles and maintaining a
    steady water supply. Smart irrigation helps conserve water, grow crops with the
    same amount of water, save money, be more eco-friendly, and be less vulnerable
    to climate change (Neupane et al. 2022; Ning and Liu 2015). However, barriers
    to wider adoption exist, including the need for costly upfront investments, specialized
    knowledge, and consistent access to the Internet (Arubayi 2023). Finally, smart
    irrigation and water management provide a game-changing strategy for environmentally
    responsible farming by helping farmers reduce water waste, maximize crop output,
    and safeguard natural resources. Farmers can help ensure food security in the
    face of climate change by adopting smart irrigation practices like drip irrigation
    and automated watering systems (Merem et al. 2018). Smart irrigation in agriculture
    is predicted to play a crucial role in attaining sustainable water management
    and guaranteeing the resilience of agricultural systems as technology develops.
    3.2 Livestock Management and Health Monitoring Livestock management is an important
    part of contemporary agriculture since it ensures the health and production of
    livestock animals (Ali and Choi 2020). AIoT technology is helping to improve livestock
    management and health monitoring. Farmers may monitor their animals’ health, behaviour,
    and position in real-time by employing wearable sensors and tracking devices,
    allowing for early diagnosis of health concerns or irregularities (Okonofua et
    al. 2021). AIoT-enabled monitoring devices give significant data into cattle movement
    and behaviour, assisting farmers in managing grazing patterns and preventing straying.
    Behavioral monitoring may detect indicators of discomfort or changes in eating
    patterns, resulting in better animal welfare (Kochovski and Stankovski 2018).
    One of the most important advantages of AIoT in livestock management is illness
    diagnosis and prevention facilitated by AIoT. AIoT devices may notify farmers
    of any sickness or stress symptoms by monitoring vital signs and physiological
    factors, limiting disease transmission and significant economic losses (Khan and
    Ahmad 2022). Furthermore, AIoT-based data analytics may aid in identifying illness
    patterns and trends, hence contributing to the creation of effective disease preventive
    programmes. AIoT technology increases animal welfare, productivity, labour costs,
    resource management efficiency, illness control, and biosecurity. However, there
    are hurdles to using AIoT in livestock management, such as initial expenses for
    AIoT devices and infrastructure, dependable connection in remote locations, and
    data privacy and security issues (Abdullahi et al. 2022). Finally, AIoT technology
    has revolutionized livestock management and health monitoring in agriculture,
    allowing farmers to carefully monitor the health and behavior of their animals,
    resulting in enhanced animal welfare and production. AIoT-enabled early disease
    detection and prevention improve biosecurity measures and minimize illness-related
    economic losses (Mishra and Pandya 2021; Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). To ensure the
    well-being of animals and farmers, the AIoT integration in livestock management
    will be crucial as technology develops, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Livestock
    management and health monitoring (Darem et al. 2022) Full size image 4 AIoT in
    Food Supply Chain Management The AIoT has changed the logistics and supply chain
    management industries by enabling real-time monitoring and tracing of items in
    transit. Sensors and gadgets enabled by the are built into things, containers,
    and vehicles to track and record data such as location, temperature, and humidity
    (Praveen et al. 2021). This real-time information allows businesses to streamline
    their supply chains and reduce wasted time and money. Due to AIoT-enabled smart
    logistics, companies can improve inventory management, save operating costs, and
    boost customer satisfaction with on-time, precise delivery (Kamble et al. 2019).
    Perishable items’ quality and safety, including fresh fruit, medicines, and vaccinations,
    depend on effective cold chain management and food preservation (Zhong et al.
    2015). Cold chain management powered by the helps keep goods fresh and secure
    across the supply chain, which helps cut down on food waste and boosts food security.
    Assuring the quality and security of goods via sensors and monitoring is crucial.
    Sensors enabled by the can check food for pH, moisture, and pollutants to ensure
    it''s safe and up to standards (Nozari et al. 2022; Rehman Khan et al. 2022).
    The AIoT makes supply chain visibility, transparency, efficiency, cost savings,
    product quality and safety improvements, sustainability, and environmental impact
    possible (Ezenwa 2019). Data privacy and security, standardization and interoperability
    of AIoT systems, and dependable and continuous connection are just a few hurdles
    that need to be cleared before widespread adoption can occur in supply chain and
    food management (Bertin et al. 2022). AIoT-enabled smart logistics and supply
    chain monitoring, cold chain management, and quality and safety assurance are
    revolutionizing how organizations operate and ensuring that supply chain operations
    are efficient and sustainable (Zakeri et al. 2022). Companies can improve logistics,
    protect the freshness of perishable items, and guarantee their products’ safety
    by using real-time data and insights (Zhong et al. 2015). To keep up with the
    demands of the current business environment and ensure the delivery of high-quality
    goods to customers, supply chain management must increasingly use AIoT technologies,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 AIoT in food supply chain management (Zhong et
    al. 2015) Full size image 5 Challenges and Barriers The technological difficulty
    of establishing and maintaining AIoT systems is a major obstacle to their widespread
    use in agriculture. Integrating sensors, devices, and networking technologies
    may be difficult, particularly for small-scale farmers in rural places with little
    infrastructure (Lu 2018). AIoT applications demand real-time data transfer, which
    might be difficult in rural areas. Data security and privacy are crucial as AIoT
    devices create massive volumes of data. Farmers must secure their crop production,
    soil health, and market data against unauthorized access and cyberattacks (Abdullahi
    et al. 2022). Data encryption, access limits, and secure communication protocols
    protect farmers’ vital data. Small-scale farmers and underdeveloped areas may
    struggle to use AIoT technology due to their high upfront costs. AIoT devices,
    sensors, and connection solutions are costly, making it hard for resource-constrained
    farmers to use them (Zimba 2022). Technical support and maintenance may also strain
    finances. Lack of awareness and understanding of AIoT, limited access to technical
    competence, and cultural opposition to new technology may hinder small-scale farmers
    in developing nations. These areas may additionally struggle to embrace AIoT technologies
    due to language and digital literacy issues (Al Qartah 2020). 5.1 Solution and
    Mitigation Technical constraints, data security concerns, financial issues, and
    acceptance hurdles might prevent the broad adoption of AIoT in agriculture, especially
    in small farms and developing nations. Stakeholders, including governments, commercial
    enterprises, and non-profits, must work together to solve these problems (Hammi
    et al. 2022). By promoting accessible and user-friendly AIoT solutions, guaranteeing
    data security, giving financial incentives, and helping farmers with capacity
    development and training, the agricultural industry can maximize AIoT’s potential
    for sustainable and efficient farming (Ouechtati et al. 2021). Simplified and
    User-Friendly Solutions: Small-scale farmers may use AIoT solutions that are user-friendly
    and cost-effective. Plug-and-play AIoT devices and straightforward interfaces
    may help farmers set up and employ AIoT technology (Jayashankar et al. 2018).
    Public–Private Partnerships: Government agencies, private firms, and NGOs may
    work together to deliver AIoT solutions in poor countries. Joint projects may
    overcome financial and technical constraints and give farmers with training and
    assistance (Hammi et al. 2022). Data Security: Encryption and authentication help
    secure farmers’ data from cyberattacks. To protect data privacy, farmers must
    be educated about data security (Bertin et al. 2022). Subsidies and Incentives:
    Government subsidies or financial incentives for adopting AIoT technology might
    encourage small-scale farmers to invest in these solutions. Implementation costs
    may be reduced via cost-sharing and tax incentives. Training and capacity development
    may improve farmers’ digital literacy and technical abilities. Extension programmes
    and training may assist farmers in grasping AIoT devices (Hammi et al. 2022).
    6 Policy and Regulatory Considerations Agriculture might become more sustainable,
    efficient, and productive using AIoT technology. Through different programmes,
    governments worldwide have supported AIoT adoption. These include financial support,
    research and development funding, capacity building and training, regulatory frameworks,
    public–private partnerships, testbeds and demonstration farms, digital infrastructure
    development, data analytics, and decision support, market linkages and e-commerce
    platforms, and policy advocacy (Lu 2018). These projects have helped farmers use
    AIoT to solve agricultural problems, boost production, and adopt sustainable and
    efficient farming methods. International partnerships and standards are critical
    to developing and accepting AIoT-based food security solutions since governments,
    organisations, and stakeholders must work together to solve the agricultural and
    food sectors’ complex problems (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). The widespread use of
    AIoT technology in agriculture has led to sustainable, efficient, and more productive
    farming. Governments worldwide have been actively pushing and supporting the adoption
    of AIoT due to its critical importance (Fang et al. 2012). Governments provide
    financial assistance, grants, and subsidies to encourage farmers and agricultural
    enterprises to invest in AIoT technology. These rebates reduce the out-of-pocket
    expense of implementing an AIoT system or device, making them more feasible for
    farms of all sizes. Government funding for research and development (R&D) programs
    that provide specialized AIoT solutions for agriculture, such as precision agriculture,
    remote sensing, and livestock monitoring, has led to the developing cutting-edge
    tools and methods (Zhang, Li et al. 2022a). Governments host training programs
    and seminars to improve farmers’ and agricultural employees’ familiarity with
    digital literacy and technical abilities. They set up legislative frameworks that
    make it easier for farmers to use AIoT. Governments create standards for AIoT
    devices and data privacy rules to guarantee the safety of AIoT solutions and protect
    farmers’ data. They work with businesses, universities, and NGOs to promote the
    use of AIoT in farming via public–private partnerships, resulting in increased
    opportunities for information exchange, access to cutting-edge technology, and
    the creation of industry-specific AIoT solutions (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Governments
    also invest in constructing and updating digital infrastructure, such as high-speed
    internet access and mobile networks, to guarantee uninterrupted data transfer
    and communication between farm AIoT devices. They provide data analytics and decision
    support systems that use information gathered from AIoT devices to advise farmers
    on improving their operations (Yin et al. 2022). Governments also develop e-commerce
    platforms that link farmers with customers or purchasers, improving market connections
    and maintaining produce quality and traceability throughout the supply chain.
    Governments advocate for policies that encourage the use of AIoT in farming, such
    as lowering taxes, fostering cross-institutional research partnerships, and lobbying
    for more lenient rules (Godager et al. 2021). The extensive use of AIoT technology
    in agriculture can be attributed to various factors, including financial incentives,
    R&D funding, capacity building, regulatory frameworks, public–private partnerships,
    and the growth of digital infrastructure (Yang et al. 2021). Sharing knowledge
    and best practices helps advance AIoT-based food security solutions. International
    cooperation and standards are essential for food security. Sharing knowledge,
    harmonizing standards, aggregating data, fostering research and development, aligning
    policies, pooling resources, and building capacities can help countries and organisations
    develop cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions for the global agriculture
    and food sectors (Kumar et al. 2020). These agreements allow data exchange and
    aggregation, improving AIoT-based food security solutions. Cross-border research
    and development projects bring together professionals from various nations to
    solve food security issues, resulting in cutting-edge technology and novel solutions
    (Yin et al. 2022). Funding and resource allocation, capacity development and training,
    scaling up successful projects, and addressing data privacy and security issues
    are all examples of ways in which policy alignment and collaboration may be fostered.
    Thus, AIoT-based food security solutions can only be fully realised via international
    cooperation and standardization. Sharing information, harmonizing standards, gathering
    data, promoting research and development, aligning policies, pooling resources,
    and creating skills may help governments and organizations handle global food
    security issues. These combined efforts will lead to sustainable and resilient
    food systems for everybody (Chilaka and Chilaka 2019). 7 Case Studies and Real-World
    Implementations The ability of AIoT solutions to tackle difficult problems and
    propel good change has been shown by their widespread adoption in some countries.
    AIoT technology may enhance productivity, sustainability, and resource management,
    as shown by the featured case studies in precision agriculture, fisheries management,
    and smart grids. Guidelines for future AIoT implementations may be derived from
    the lessons gained and best practices in interoperability, data security, user-centric
    design, and local context concerns (Yin et al. 2022). In order to create a more
    sustainable and interconnected society, AIoT solutions must continue to develop
    and cooperate. Many sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation,
    and more, have been radically altered by AIoT development. This section looks
    at real-world deployments of AIoT technologies in various areas to draw up lessons
    and best practices (Yin et al. 2022). Some globally effective solutions are (Cliff
    et al. 2023; Godager et al. 2021). Accurate farming methods in the USA: Precision
    farming has become more popular in the United States. Farmers use the devices
    like soil sensors, weather stations, and drones to monitor their crops and ensure
    everything is running well. Farmers may improve their irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest management methods with real-time data from these sensors. Sustainable
    agriculture has benefited from increased agricultural yields and more effective
    use of available resources. Norwegian Smart Fishery Management: Norway has introduced
    -based solutions to encourage responsible fishing practices in its fisheries sector.
    AIoT technologies like GPS trackers and sensors are installed aboard fishing boats
    to keep tabs on catch rates, fish stocks, and environmental factors. By using
    this information, authorities can better enforce fishing limits, curb overfishing,
    and safeguard marine ecosystems, assuring the fishing industry''s continued success.
    South Korean smart grids: South Korea''s energy industry has made great efforts
    towards implementing technology. (AIoT) sensors are used in smart grids for real-time
    monitoring of energy usage, distribution optimisation, and problem detection.
    Improved grid efficiency in South Korea has resulted in lower energy costs and
    greater sustainability through lowering energy waste and increasing energy dependability.
    7.1 Best Practices and Real-World Lessons The practices and real-world lessons
    include (Janabi and Kurnaz 2023): Standardisation and Compatibility: Successful
    systems need standardized communication protocols and the ability to easily integrate
    new hardware and software. The easy sharing of data and compatibility across various
    AIoT components are made possible by establishing interoperability. Data Privacy
    and Protection: Sensitive data must be collected and sent securely in AIoT implementations.
    To defend against cyber risks and preserve user privacy, implementers should prioritize
    data encryption, user authentication, and data access restrictions. User-centered
    design: Users are the focus of good design. To increase user adoption and engagement,
    it is important to provide user-friendly interfaces, clear representations, and
    intuitive functionality. Flexibility and scalability: The data volume and the
    number of connected devices are expected to grow over time. Therefore, AIoT implementations
    must be flexible. As a result of its adaptability, new technologies, and future
    growth may be easily included. Consideration of the Local Context: Successful
    installations need adjustments for each unique situation. To provide successful
    solutions, it is essential to appreciate various geographical areas’ specific
    difficulties, cultural subtleties, and infrastructural limitations. Coordination
    and Cooperation: Governments, businesses, universities, and communities all have
    a stake in a successful rollout of the Partners may pool their knowledge, skills,
    and resources through collaboration to create long-lasting improvements. Control
    and Assessment: To determine how successful an AIoT solution is and where it may
    be enhanced, constant monitoring and assessment are required. Insights derived
    from data analysis support continual optimization and enable evidence-based decision-making.
    Instruction and Capacity Development: The knowledge and proficiency of end-users
    and implementers of AIoT technologies may be improved via training and capacity-building
    programs. Building people''s abilities is crucial to ensuring that the solutions
    have the desired effect. 8 Future Trends and Innovations The AIoT has advanced
    swiftly and is continuing to drive innovation. In the not-too-distant future,
    AIoT technologies will merge with AI and machine learning, resulting in unheard-of
    levels of efficiency and automation. The introduction of 5G technology and the
    development of edge computing will also usher in a new era of AIoT applications,
    particularly in the agricultural industry (Saad et al. 2023). Improvements in
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, and edge computing point to a bright
    future for AIoT in agriculture by fueling substantial gains in efficiency, sustainability,
    and production. 5G and edge computing will improve connection and data processing,
    and combining AI and machine learning with AIoT will allow for predictive analytics
    and autonomous systems. Precision farming, smart irrigation, remote monitoring,
    and evidence-based decision-making are just some ways the AIoT will revolutionise
    agriculture and strengthen the foundations of sustainable agriculture worldwide
    (Seyyedabbasi et al. 2023). The potential for innovation and beneficial influence
    on the agricultural business is limitless as these technologies continue to advance.
    The potential impact of 5G and edge computing on AIoT applications in agriculture
    and future trends and breakthroughs in AIoT are discussed. 8.1 Future Trends and
    Innovations in AIoT Increasing connectivity among AIoT devices will provide simple
    two-way communication and data sharing. Because of this enhanced connectedness,
    data analysis and decision-making will become more holistic and integrated. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be included into AIoT
    devices, allowing them to analyse and anticipate trends and patterns in real-time
    data (Garg and Goyal 2020). As a result of this capacity, procedures and resource
    allocation may be optimised for greater efficacy. With edge computing, processing
    may be done closer to the data source, which speeds up processing and decreases
    latency. Edge intelligence-equipped AIoT devices will be able to do sophisticated
    tasks locally, cutting down on demand for cloud computing. The AIoT, AI, and ML
    will merge to generate fully autonomous systems. As a result, production will
    rise, human errors will decrease, and efficiency will improve. AIoT will revolutionize
    urban planning and infrastructure management, leading to the construction of smart
    cities with linked transportation, electricity, waste management, and more systems
    (Mousavi et al. 2021). 8.2 Integration of AIoT, AI, and Machine Learning AI and
    ML algorithms will analyze massive volumes of data the AIoT creates. This will
    allow for enhanced knowledge of agricultural procedures and more efficient use
    of available resources (Olan et al. 2022). Precision agriculture will become a
    reality in which farmers administer inputs like water and fertiliser with pinpoint
    accuracy using real-time data and analysis made possible by AI-driven AIoT apps.
    By taking this course of action, both yields and environmental impact may be improved.
    With AI, devices can anticipate when agricultural machinery and equipment need
    repair (Olan et al. 2022; Pan and Zhang 2021). 8.3 The Possible Effect of 5G and
    Edge Computing on Applications in Farming With the increased bandwidth and decreased
    latency that 5G networks provide, the AIoT can communicate with one another in
    near real-time. With the help of 5G and edge computing, farmers can keep an eye
    on their crops and animals without leaving their homes (Rathod et al. 2023). Data-intensive
    AIoT applications, such as high-resolution image and video analytics, will be
    supported by 5G’s fast data rates and the processing capabilities of edge computing,
    enhancing agricultural monitoring and analysis. AIoT-enabled irrigation systems
    with 5G connection and edge computing can optimize water consumption and save
    waste by adjusting the amount of water supplied depending on real-time data, soil
    moisture levels, and weather predictions (Varsha et al. 2021). 9 Conclusion This
    chapter examines the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices via data-driven
    decision-making and precision agriculture on the path to sustainable agriculture
    and food security. Agricultural output, resource effectiveness, and supply chain
    management benefit greatly from AIoT-enabled systems. AIoT improves agricultural
    operations by helping farmers and stakeholders make better choices based on real-time
    data and analytics. Due to the AIoT, farmers can track and manage their crops
    with pinpoint accuracy, improving efficiency, lessening environmental damage,
    and boosting agricultural yields. By allowing farmers to adjust water distribution
    in response to current weather and crop circumstances, smart irrigation systems
    improve water efficiency while decreasing water waste. Better illness diagnosis,
    health assessment, and livestock management contribute to happier, healthier animals.
    A well-oiled supply chain guarantees that food is safe to eat, cuts down on post-harvest
    losses, and speeds up the delivery of crops to consumers. AIoT plays a crucial
    role in developing sustainable agriculture and attaining global food security
    by using real-time data and analytics and closing the information gap between
    farmers, agribusinesses, and consumers. With the ongoing development of AIoT,
    AI, and 5G technologies, the future of AIoT in agriculture seems bright. Data
    security, privacy issues, high implementation costs, and accessibility for small-scale
    farmers in underdeveloped countries are only some of the obstacles that must be
    overcome. Understanding AIoT''s societal and economic effects on agriculture requires
    a study conducted by agronomists, environmentalists, and social scientists. Investing
    in AIoT-related research and development may lead to a future where agriculture
    is more sustainable, productive, and ecologically aware. References Abdullahi

    the current era, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has gained popularity.
    This is due to addition of sensing, receiving, and transmitting capabilities to
    any physical object. IoT plays a vital role in various verticals of everyday life.
    IoT finds its application in Industrial IoT, precision agriculture, smart cities,
    and healthcare applications [1]. The sensors in the IoT system sense various physical
    parameters. The data is collected from these sensors and stored in a central server.
    However, the data security in the central server and its privacy preservation
    is an important aspect. The IoT brings in several advantages, but the leakage
    of the sensitive information or the attack by hackers can ruin its sole purpose.
    Therefore, connecting several physical objects over the Internet with strong protection
    of the data is the prime requirement. The focus of research is to save this collected
    data securely in decentralized architecture. The integration of blockchain technology
    in IoT permits the physical objects to securely transmit data in peer-to-peer
    network. The blockchain minimizes the risk of any fraudulent information entering
    in the IoT network. This is because before the entry of data in within the network,
    the consent is taken from majority of the users instead of the single central
    authority [2]. Furthermore, blockchain-based IoT system builds a strong and robust
    network in which it prevents the hackers to steal all the information just by
    attacking the central server. In IoT-based system, data security is obtained by
    applying encryption. The encryption technique involves each node in the IoT system
    to carry two keys, namely public key and private key. The public key is available
    to other nodes that encrypts the data which is then broadcasted to all other nodes
    in the network. The private key is secret to individual nodes that is used for
    decrypting the data. The blockchain technology prevents the fraudulent intruder
    to falsely encrypt the information. In a blockchain-based IoT network, all the
    physical objects within the network are identified by public key. Therefore, this
    sharing may lead to third-party attack that can make out the identity of the IoT
    participants. The blockchain-based IoT system eliminates single point of failure;
    this enhances fault tolerance and reliability of IoT system. The IoT devices participating
    in a blockchain-based network can verify data integrity and identity of sender
    [3]. Also, blockchain provides secure software updates and data storage capability
    to IoT-based system. Furthermore, blockchain technology stores data in an immutable
    which provides backtracking and traceability capabilities. IoT allows the inter-connectivity
    of physical objects “things” by providing sensing and transmitting capabilities.
    In the current era, IoT finds its applications in everyday life making smart networks.
    These smart networks are capable of sensing various physical parameters and the
    taking valuable decisions. The decentralization enhances the IoT networks scalability
    and performances. With the exponential growth in the adoption and popularity of
    IoT technology, the demand of secure data storage and transmission is increasing
    immensely. The security of the data is essential; any kind of data leakage or
    attack by intruder can lead to disclosure of critical information. Thus, it is
    essential to preserve the privacy of data and grant access of data to authorized
    users. However, there are few prerequisite security requirements for IoT-based
    system like confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, authorization,
    and availability. The integration of the block chain technology with IoT enhances
    the reliability of IoT-based system in terms of security. The blockchain provides
    data security to resource constrained end devices in IoT-based system. Also, the
    blockchain technology is capable to handle heterogeneity, privacy protection,
    and confidentiality of IoT-based systems. 2 Literature Review This section describes
    literature review of the state-of-the-art approaches. Bhutta et al. [4] in 1991
    introduced blockchain technology as “a cryptographically secured chain of blocks”.
    Baur et al. [5] in 2018 implemented blockchain as a public ledger and received
    universal recognition in a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin. It is gaining popularity
    in various sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and insurance. The blockchain
    technology provides secure distributed architecture that works without intervention
    of any centralized or third party. Wang et al. [6] defined blockchain as a chain
    of blocks that are linked cryptographically using hash functions. It works on
    a peer-to-peer network of participants. The blockchain technology provides the
    highest degree of accountability. This feature has resulted in the adaptation
    of blockchain technology for data transmission and record-keeping in various sectors
    of real-life applications. The blockchain technology provides these real-life
    applications with proper documentation and digitally confirms the ownership of
    assets. Hildebrand et al. [7] proposed that blockchain technology blocks are ordered
    unambiguously using consensus algorithm. Thus, this makes blockchain technology
    verifiable, consistent, auditable and enhances integrity among all the participants.
    Jain et al. [8] proposed a block constitutes version information, hash of the
    parent block, timestamp, nonce, count of transaction, and combination of hash
    transactions. Whenever a new block has been generated, then each participant will
    apply block authentication process. After appropriate validation and approval,
    this block is appended to the parent block with the help of reference. This process
    helps to detect the unidentified or unauthorized transactions. Unauthorized or
    falsified blocks can be identified by the hash value which is completely different
    from authorized blocks. Meryem et al. [9] proposed the integration of blockchain
    technology for security in IoT-based smart homes. Mohamed et al. [10] proposed
    security in IoT-enabled smart industry environment for Industry 4.0 applications.
    3 Working Principle of Blockchain A blockchain structure is represented in the
    form of list of blocks with ordered transactions. The list is stored as flat file
    database. The point to notice is that there is no pointer pointing to the first
    block, and the terminal block has a pointer with null value. Figure 1 shows the
    structure of blockchain. A block contains version, parent block hash, timestamp,
    nonce, transaction count, and Merkle root. Nonce is an integer that starts from
    0 and increases every time after hash is calculated. The Merkle root is the combined
    hash of all transactions. Figure 2 shows the working principle of a blockchain
    technology. Whenever a new record or transaction is to be added into a blockchain,
    it needs to be verified and digitally signed by nodes in the system. Any block
    contains data, its hash value, and hash of the previous block. It depends which
    kind of data has been stored in a blockchain such as receiver, sender, and the
    amount of coins. A hash is like a digital signature or a fingerprint. The hash
    of a block is generated using cryptographic hash algorithm. The hash helps in
    identifying each block in a blockchain structure. Any modification in a block
    results in change of its hash. The hash of the previous block helps to form a
    chain structure which plays a major role of providing security. Any fraudulent
    attempt to change the data of a block leads to invalidation of the whole blockchain
    system. The proof-of-work is performed by the miners which are special nodes within
    the blockchain structure. The miners get transaction fees as a reward from the
    block. Whenever a new block is created, it is verified by all nodes in a system.
    All nodes in the blockchain system adhere to the consensus protocol. Thus, this
    makes a blockchain system immutable and secure [11]. Table 1 shows the classification
    of blockchain architecture. Fig. 1 Blockchain structure Full size image Fig. 2
    Working principle of blockchain technology Full size image Table 1 Classification
    of blockchain architecture Full size table The major characteristics that have
    resulted in adaption of blockchain technology in real-life applications are as
    follows: Transparency: The participants in the public blockchain systems can communicate
    with equal rights. In the public blockchain systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin,
    the authentication of each transaction is recorded. This data is available to
    all the participants in the blockchain network. Thus, data on the blockchain is
    transparent to each node so as to validate the committed transaction in the blockchain.
    Decentralization: In a centralized architecture, the validation of transaction
    is performed by central server. This causes bottleneck problem, whereas blockchain
    works on a distributed architecture where validation of transaction is performed
    in peer-to-peer manner. Thus, this enhances the performance of system in terms
    of cost-effectiveness, resolving bottleneck problem, and single-point failure.
    Immutability: In a blockchain, a chain structure is formed by linking the blocks
    through hash values. When any kind of data tampering is performed, it causes invalidation
    of all consecutive blocks. Thus, the blockchain structure is immutable. Pseudonymity:
    The blockchain is partially confidential as the addresses of participants can
    be traced. Non-repudiation: Each participant in the blockchain system contains
    a private key. This can be decrypted by other participants with help of public
    keys. Thus, cryptographically encrypted transactions are non-repudiable. Traceability:
    The blockchain technology offers traceability; this is achieved with help of timestamp
    attached to every transaction. This results in tractability of origin and modification
    of any transaction [12]. 4 Smart Contracts The smart contract can be defined as
    the programs which are stored on a blockchain. The smart contract programs run
    only when the predetermined conditions are fulfilled. The benefit of smart contract
    is that they automate the execution of an agreement. This results in reliability
    of the agreement without involving any third party. Furthermore, it is a faster
    approach which makes the system autonomous where workflows are maintained and
    the consecutive actions are triggered on fulfillment of the predetermined conditions.
    Thus, smart contracts insert a secure and automatic contractual mechanism where
    the contracting parties evaluate success or violation of the contract. Smart contracts
    are programs that encrypt and replicate contractual agreements [13]. The smart
    contract through blockchain technology in computer domain brings various benefits
    such as no commission fees, no involvement of trusted-party dependency, and no
    mutual interaction of counterparties. Smart contracts can be generated by publishing
    a transaction to the blockchain. The miners in the blockchain run smart contracts
    and achieve agreement on its implementation. Each contract is assigned a 160-bit
    address on implementation. If a transaction is generated, then contract is executed
    using this address. There are various platforms for the development of smart contract
    such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Nem, Corda, Stellar, Waves, Cardano,
    Neo, EOS, Rootstock, Tendermint, and Quorum. These platforms such as Bitcoin can
    implement smart contracts that offer a modern-way of money exchange that provides
    innovative solutions and easy interfaces for developers. 5 Blockchain Integration
    with IoT IoT provides digital transformation and has revolutionized the real world.
    The network of sensors produces large voluminous data which is analyzed by a central
    server. The central server makes valuable decision and helps in knowledge discovery.
    The information in the IoT-based system requires safe and secure transmission
    and storage. The integration of the block chain technology with IoT enhances the
    reliability of IoT-based system in terms of security [14]. The blockchain provides
    data security to resource-constrained end devices in IoT-based system. Also, the
    blockchain technology is capable to handle heterogeneity, privacy protection,
    and confidentiality of IoT-based systems. The major advantages of integrating
    blockchain technology in IoT-based systems are listed below: The data which is
    collected by the sensors is secured by blockchains. The storage of this data is
    done in blockchain network in the form of encrypted transactions. The blockchain
    technology provides the IoT-based systems with enhanced interoperability. There
    is no involvement of third party while interaction between the IoT devices which
    makes the whole IoT system autonomous [15, 16]. Blockchain technology enhances
    the reliability of IoT-based system by providing availability, authenticity, confidentiality,
    accountability, and traceability. Also, blockchain faster the process of IoT-based
    systems by proving secure and decentralized features with no third-party intervention.
    The blockchain technology utilizes consensus mechanisms which prevents denial-of-service
    attacks. This is achieved by imposing charge for each transaction. The technology
    implementation in IoT networks enhances the overall security within the network
    by enforcing access control and data integrity [17, 18]. The blockchain technology
    makes it impossible for the intruders to modify records and hide transactions
    in IoT-based systems. This is achieved through decentralized consensus mechanism.
    It utilizes features of encrypting data using public and private keys which provides
    privacy preservation [19, 20]. 6 Proposed Secure IoT-Based Land Registry Architecture
    The land registry involves sharing transactional information of land pieces. The
    blockchain enhances data security and provides secure land registry system including
    authentication of all land transactions between involved parties. The blockchain
    technology prevents illegal land transaction, and through hash-based chain structure,
    it detects fraudulent modification registry. Thus, it helps to secure land transactions
    and registry records. Figure 3 shows the proposed land registry system architecture.
    Initially, all land registry centers and users are required to register themselves
    in a mobile application. They will receive pairs of public and private keys by
    execution of the registration function. A user can request the land registry centers
    to issue certificate. When the user initiates a request to the authorities, then
    verification of users details is performed which is stored on the blockchain network.
    The blockchain network issues a certificate based on users details stored during
    the registration. The issued certificate is stored in a decentralized Inter-Planetary
    File System. The user then receives the calculated hash value. The land registry
    details are managed as a transaction with a unique ID. This transaction is stored
    in a specific block of the blockchain network. Fig. 3 Proposed secure IoT-based
    land registry architecture Full size image 7 Conclusion The paper presents a comprehensive
    survey of blockchain technology including characteristics, architecture, and working
    principle of blockchain. It describes the need of data security and privacy preservation
    for IoT-based systems. Also, it describes the benefits of integrating blockchain
    technology with the IoT-based systems and solution that blockchain technology
    provides to IoT-based system in terms of security. This paper proposes a blockchain-based
    technology to provide security in terms of authenticity, integrity, availability,
    and confidentiality. The paper presents a secure IoT-based land registry system

  data_sources: Real-world data from an IoT deployment
  description: Continued development of communication technologies has led to widespread
    Internet-of-Things (IoT) integration into various domains, including health, manufacturing,
    automotive, and precision agriculture. This has further led to the increased sharing
    of data among such domains to foster innovation. Most of these IoT deployments,
    however, are based on heterogeneous, pervasive sensors, which can lead to quality
    issues in the recorded data. This can lead to sharing of inaccurate or inconsistent
    data. There is a significant need to assess the quality of the collected data,
    should it be shared with multiple application domains, as inconsistencies in the
    data could have financial or health ramifications. This article builds on the
    recent research on trust metrics and presents a framework to integrate such metrics
    into the IoT data cycle for real-time data quality assessment. Critically, this
    article adopts a mechanism to facilitate end-user parameterization of a trust
    metric tailoring its use in the framework. Trust is a well-established metric
    that has been used to determine the validity of a piece or source of data in crowd-sourced
    or other unreliable data collection techniques such as that in IoT. The article
    further discusses how the trust-based framework eliminates the requirement for
    a gold standard and provides visibility into data quality assessment throughout
    the big data model. To qualify the use of trust as a measure of quality, an experiment
    is conducted using data collected from an IoT deployment of sensors to measure
    air quality in which low-cost sensors were colocated with a gold standard reference
    sensor. The calculated trust metric is compared with two well-understood metrics
    for data quality, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
    A strong correlation between the trust metric and the comparison metrics shows
    that trust may be used as an indicative quality metric for data quality. The metric
    incorporates the additional benefit of its ability for use in low context scenarios,
    as opposed to RMSE and MAE, which require a reference for comparison.

    I. Introduction The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has seen tremendous growth
    in the industry in the last five years. The number of connected devices in various
    sectors has also grown. This has, in turn, led to an increase in the amount of
    data generated and consumed. This exponential increase in data collected and consumed
    led to the IoT big data wave. This is characterized by volume, velocity, variety,
    veracity, and value, the 5V’s of big data as they are known [1]. As this data
    is collected, it must undergo several stages from collection to decision-making.
    These stages form the big data model. The big data model is a series of stages
    that the data must undergo from when it is created to when it is used. Each preceding
    stage is critical for the success of the next stage. Fig. 1 shows the various
    stages of the big data model. Data collection, data preprocessing, data processing,
    and data use are separate stages of the big data model. It is beneficial to interrogate
    data quality independently at each stage in the model. It can also be argued,
    however, that data quality should be reviewed longitudinally through the model
    for a given input and use case. For each stage, data can have different properties,
    and therefore, data quality has to be assessed separately but also represented
    differently. This is equally true for different data users and applications within
    the IoT ecosystem. Fig. 1. Big data model. Show All The data generated and consumed
    within IoT comes from several domains including, but not limited, to: 1) smart
    homes; 2) smart cities; 3) manufacturing; and 4) automotive to environmental sensing.
    Current discussions introduce the opportunities that sharing and consuming data
    across such domains of the IoT ecosystem would have for further innovation in
    the IoT space. This sharing of data across multiple domain spaces is referred
    to as data-shared IoT [2]. The example in Fig. 2 shows how a smart city application
    can benefit from data fusion of its own data with data from other IoT applications
    for better insights. For this fusion to be fruitful, it is important to ensure
    that the shared data conform to certain quality standards and can be trusted by
    the consuming application. Fig. 2. Shared IoT ecosystem. Show All This article
    presents a mechanism that aims to achieve the following objectives: 1) tailor
    assessment as per user requirements; 2) decouple metrics from the evaluation strategy;
    and 3) allow for longitudinal fusion of quality scores. Achieving these aims comes
    with challenges associated with them. Here, the aims are explained, and in Section
    IV, the challenges are highlighted. Decoupling the mechanics of providing a quality
    score from the means of evaluating the quality. The big data cycle (BDC) has various
    stages that data must undergo. At each stage, the data can have different quality
    issues. To determine and address data quality issues, it is beneficial to assess
    quality at each stage considering only the data properties at that stage. The
    ability to map data quality to the individual stage of the BDC will be referred
    to as the mechanics of providing or advertising quality. This can be separated
    from the metric used to evaluate the quality. This article uses a trust metric
    to provide a quality score, however, the mechanism can be applied to other quality
    metrics. This is illustrated in Section VII where each trust stage is decoupled
    and integrated into the BDC. This separation is useful to achieve a domain and
    use-case-agnostic solution. Each unique domain and use case can define its own
    metric for calculating a quality score without affecting the mechanics of applying
    quality assessment or advertising quality. Furthermore, when the quality requirements
    of an application change, the metric of assessing quality can be customized to
    that application’s needs without affecting, or needing to change the underlying
    mechanics of assessment. Longitudinal fusion of data quality defines a means to
    combine the various quality scores from each stage of the BDC into a single score
    that is representative of the end-to- end processes that the data has undergone.
    This process should be independent of the metric of assessing quality. Any fusion
    technique can be used here. In Section VIII, a naive fusion approach was used
    to distinguish between a low-quality stream and a gold reference stream. The intention,
    however, is to investigate more advanced fusion techniques. A tangible link between
    data quality, data quality types, and their effect on data through the stages
    of the BDC has been demonstrated [2]. This concept, however, is yet to be implemented.
    This describes the longitudinal relationship between the various data quality
    issues across the BDC. For example, knowing which data quality issues are present
    in the initial stages of the BDC (data preprocessing) and how this affects the
    next stage can help determine a data-processing technique in that stage. Data
    quality tailoring allows an application to customize quality assessment to suit
    its requirements. Quality itself is subjective and so should be evaluated as such.
    Data that is good for a particular application or use case might not be for the
    other. Each application should be able to define its own quality. For example,
    if data accuracy is important for a particular application and data latency (timeliness)
    is not, then the quality score should be customized to reflect that. This is illustrated
    by the use case in Section X, based on a custom data quality score, and each application
    can connect or disconnect from a data source. Current solutions aim to optimize
    quality assessment for a given use case [3], [4], [5], [6]. The resulting solutions,
    however, may not be applicable to another use case. Taleb et al. [7] described
    the importance of integrating quality assessment with the BDC, connecting quality
    assessment with the source of the quality issues. This approach, however, has
    not been implemented. This article presents a real-time end-to- end implementation
    of a data quality assessment framework that can be used to assess the quality
    of data in IoT deployments. The framework leverages trust as a means to assess
    quality where no reference or ground-truth data is available. Assessment of quality
    throughout the BDC allows identification of introduced quality issues at each
    stage. The framework is agnostic of the trust metric or fusion technique used;
    however, a trust metric presented in earlier work [2] is used in the implementation
    and testing. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section II presents
    background information. Section III presents the state-of-the-art. Section IV
    details the existing challenges in implementing quality assessment in IoT environments.
    Section V presents the motivation for the proposed framework and highlights why
    trust is an important metric for the assessment of data quality in IoT. Section
    VI provides a detailed description of the framework including the mathematical
    formulation of the framework and microservice-based implementation of the solution.
    Section IX presents the testing environment, datasets employed, evaluation strategy,
    and results of the evaluation. Finally, Section XI presents the concluding remarks
    and future work. SECTION II. Background This section introduces three concepts
    that are central to this work: 1) data quality; 2) data quality dimensions (DQDs)
    and trust; and 3) their application within an IoT context. It then highlights
    the use of trust as a measure of quality. A. Data Quality Data collected from
    sensing IoT devices is of paramount importance today. Such data is being used
    to advance innovations and inform decision-making. Much of this data comes from
    low-cost sensor devices, which are inherently unreliable [8]. Assessing and ascertaining
    the quality of such data before using it is therefore important. Data quality
    has widely been studied in database management [9], [10], [11] and also in the
    big data context [12]. Poor data quality management can have adverse negative
    effects on business decisions [13]. Data quality is subjective, making it dependent
    on the use case and domain area. It has been defined differently in academic and
    industrial contexts [14]. Sidi et al. [3] defined data quality based on how appropriate
    it is for use based on user need. According to Heravizadeh et al. [15], quality
    means the totality of the characteristics of an entity (data) that bear on its
    ability to satisfy stated and implied needs. B. Data Quality Dimensions DQDs provide
    an acceptable way to measure data quality. Several authors have defined different
    DQD, each with associated metrics [14]. A DQD is a characteristic or feature of
    information for classifying information and data requirements. As such, it offers
    a way for measuring and managing data quality as well as information [3]. It is
    important to note that there is no standard definition of DQD that is acceptable
    as domain-independent [16]. It is argued that some of these could be task-independent,
    and therefore not restrained by the context of application while others are task-dependent
    [17]. In Lee et al. [18], many of these were studied and later summarized them
    into four main categories as shown in Table I. TABLE I DQD Categories C. Trust
    Trust can be defined as the belief of a trustor in a trustee that the trustee
    will accomplish a given task by satisfying the trustor’s expectation [16]. Different
    users have different requirements that must be satisfied before they can trust
    a source. Examples of these can relate to DQDs including reliability, competence,
    credentials, and reputation. In the era where information is widely available,
    users are tasked with gauging the quality of such. From the trust perspective,
    a data source can build a reputation over time to become trustworthy. Trust in
    itself is a process, and therefore trust can be formed, improved, and also lost.
    Some data sources have built trust over time and now they are more trusted than
    others. Trust has been widely used in other areas. In service computing, Malik
    and Bouguettaya [19] and Chang et al. [20] used trust to select the best service
    for a user. Jøsang et al. [21] proposed systems that could be used to derive measures
    of trust and reputation for Internet transactions. D. Trust as a Measure of Data
    Quality In a wider sense, trust has been used as a measure of quality, especially
    in information systems. It is assumed that if more people trust a product or service,
    it has better quality and vice versa. This same principle has been used widely
    in information search on the Internet and more recently in recommender engines
    [22]. Like trust, quality is an iterative process that must be constantly reassessed.
    To achieve a level of trustworthiness, different trust attributes must be evaluated
    at every stage and how these contribute to each other. The uniqueness of trust
    as a metric for data quality assessment lies in its properties. Byabazaire et
    al. [23] highlights these properties and how each can be used to harness trust
    as data quality metrics, especially in data-shared IoT scenarios. For example,
    trust is personalizable. In IoT, each application has a unique description of
    data quality. SECTION III. State-of-the-Art Several solutions have been proposed
    to help ensure that data retain its quality within database management and a few
    in the context of IoT and big data. While data quality assessment in a general
    context can be considered a mature field of study, data quality assessment in
    the context of IoT has not yet been fully explored [24]. There are several methods
    to ensure data retains its quality. This Section contrasts two approaches to data
    quality assessment that relate to this work. The first approach aims to develop
    DQDs that can be used by domain experts to assess data quality both generally,
    and in the context of IoT. The other approach aims to take these DQDs and develop
    solutions that automate the process of assessing and improving data quality. A.
    Development of DQDs DQDs offer a way for measuring and managing data quality as
    well as information [25]. More precisely, DQDs describe the various measurable
    metrics of data quality. The main aim of the solutions is to define new DQDs and
    evaluate them based on expert opinion. The data quality assessments framework
    based on DQDs date back to 1998. Total Data Quality Management (TDQM) by Wang
    [27] has been widely accepted within database management systems [28], [29] and
    within big data and IoT systems [30], [31], [32]. One of its core advantages is
    that it emphasizes an iterative approach to data quality management. Data users
    specify their requirements, and data engineers (information product engineers)
    translate these into DQDs that are measurable. Finally, expert knowledge is used
    to validate the requirements against the output of the engineers. Their implementation
    proposes 15 DQDs that can be applied to various domains and have been widely adopted.
    The evaluation of the framework is based on domain expert knowledge. Lee et al.
    [18] later proposed AIM quality (AIMQ) that is based on TDQM. The major contribution
    of this work classifies DQDs into four categories: 1) intrinsic; 2) contextual;
    3) representational; and 4) accessibility. Several other methodologies have also
    been proposed based on TDQM. While the solutions above are more general, more
    recently, Alrae et al. [33] proposed “House of Information Quality framework for
    IoT systems.” This differs from the above solutions in that it compares DQDs associated
    with information quality and the core IoT elements to define DQDs that are necessary
    for IoT applications. Like the above solutions, expert opinion is used as a significant
    validation method. This is a good validation strategy, but not good for runtime
    assessment. B. Application of DQDs This section highlights solutions that use
    DQDs to implement applications for assessing and improving that quality. In these,
    some have advanced a data-centric approach by trying to mitigate the errors in
    the data itself [34], [35], [36], and others have proposed a process-centric approach
    where the data collection process is assessed [3], [4], [5], [6]. Javed and Wolf
    [36] presented a technique that leverages spatial and temporal interpolation to
    identify outliers in sensor reading. They evaluate their solution using weather
    sensing and conclude that the same method can be used in any application domain
    where the underlying phenomenon is continuous. Tsai et al. [34] proposed an abnormal
    sensor detection architecture that leverages machine-learning techniques, using
    a trained Bayesian model that can predict values of sensor nodes via other correlated
    sensors. Their results show they can detect abnormal sensors in real-time. Vilenski
    et al. [35] looked at a multivariate anomaly detection technique for ensuring
    the data quality of dendrometer sensor networks. The anomalous sensors are identified
    statistically by comparing a sensor’s readings to an expected reading from a similar,
    healthy sensor network. As a gold standard, expert knowledge was used to assess
    the system. The above solutions address a single DQD (accuracy) by employing anomaly
    detection techniques. Contrary to the above, Kim et al. [37] used accurate and
    consistent DQDs and proposed a system for filtering data based on the sensing
    objects. By employing a Bayesian classifier, the classifier can filter sensing
    objects with inaccurate data and then deliver data with integrity to the server
    for analysis. The performance of the proposed data-filtering system is evaluated
    through computer simulation. This research identifies the necessity of addressing
    multiple DQDs and directs the work in this article for a general framework to
    apply multiple DQDs in assessment, with those DQDs specified by the end user.
    Current approaches are evaluated by either expert knowledge (Section III-A), by
    a unique process (Section III-B), or by bespoke gold standard reference measure
    for a given use case. The evaluation strategy is thus specific to the use case.
    Identifying a means to evaluate data quality assessment strategy via a benchmark
    remains an open challenge. Table II compares some of the previous research and
    the evaluation strategies used against the proposed approach. TABLE II Comparison
    of the Various Evaluation Strategies SECTION IV. Existing Challenges The approach
    to data quality assessment in this article is to investigate how the aspects of
    data quality affect the performance of each stage in the big data model and how
    this affects subsequent stages. To understand how data quality assessment proliferates
    and affects data use cases, it is essential to understand the relationship between
    data quality and the big data model. Thus far, the literature does not consider
    data quality as a fundamental aspect of the big data model. A challenge exists
    with regard to structuring DQDs within the big data model so that the effect of
    data quality is identified throughout the model. Currently, it is difficult to
    know which part of the big data model is responsible for what portion of the overall
    data quality score. These are referred to as structure-related challenges [2].
    With a given data quality structure in mind, considerations on how data quality
    measurements from one stage of the big data model can and should affect data quality
    measurements at other stages in the big data model. This may involve combining
    or weighting quality measurements for a given stage or use case. A number of challenges
    exist in this space and are referred to as method-related challenges. Implementing
    a given assessment structure and methodology into a data pipeline from end to
    end considering the uniqueness of each stage of the BDC remains a challenge. These
    are referred to as implementation challenges. A. Method-Related Challenges Data
    quality can be highly subjective. A single data point or source can have varying
    qualities depending on the use-case context. How might data quality be represented
    in a general manner throughout the big data model yet allow subjective assessment
    by two (or more) end users? Data quality is measured and represented in different
    forms depending on the stage and context within the big data model. How can these
    data quality measures be combined across the big data model stages to infer a
    quality metric which is useful for use-case quality determination? This article
    addresses these challenges by providing a means of decoupling the mechanics of
    providing a quality score and the methods of evaluating quality. B. Implementation-Related
    Challenges The current implementation of data collection/processing solutions
    for IoT and big data are based on a data pipeline. The BDC is broken down into
    a set of defined individual and independent services. For a data assessment solution
    to be feasible, it should be integrated into such data pipelines. Challenges exist
    in choosing the significant stages in the pipeline where data should be evaluated.
    Other challenges include, fusing different scores from independent stages of the
    data pipeline into a single score that can be used and advertised to applications.
    This would help explain the interrelationship of the various stages of the BDC
    and data quality issues. This article implements a naive approach of considering
    all the scores equally, but the goal is to investigate other fusion techniques.
    SECTION V. Rationale for Trust This section serves and provides the motivation
    for introducing trust as a driver for data quality measurement and incorporating
    data quality into the big data model. Trust has been used previously as a measure
    of data quality. Keßler and De Groot [38] studied how the quality of geographic
    information can be estimated through the notion of trust as a proxy measure. Trust
    is a unitless measure that can be used in composite metrics. A trust score can
    be used to represent the composite score of a chosen number of DQDs used to assess
    quality while representing a competitive score evaluating two (or more) sources.
    Moreover, trust based on previous events can help minimize the required processing
    time for real-time applications. Trust is expressed using the experience metric
    in the implementation of this article. Experience (e): Data quality is currently
    measured by evaluating over a period of data points and determining a quality
    score for an instance over this period. Real-time subscriptions to data streams
    are concerned with current data quality at the head of the stream. Assessing this
    quality over a period, up to the head of the stream can be expensive. Furthermore,
    this quality measure will age, requiring reevaluation. This article presents an
    experience metric (e) , based on a trust paradigm, which can be used to continuously
    assess quality at the head of a data stream with low overhead. Experience is modeled
    on the following properties of trust. Dynamic: Trust can increase or decrease
    with new experiences (usage or interactions). This feature has been modeled through
    different techniques. For example, in PeerTrust [39], they use an iterative windowing
    approach which allows users to customize the overall trust score by varying past
    and present experiences of an actor. In this article, the defined generic experience
    metric provides an innovative way to allow a data stream/data provider to build
    trust over time. This is different from the current data quality evaluation strategies
    that, while considering historical data, return an instantaneous metric. Personalized:
    This allows each data agent/consumer to customize its own trust metric by either
    assigning different weights to the metric or defining its own experience metric.
    This provides an innovative way to assess data quality based on the specifications
    of the data consumer. SECTION VI. Proposed Framework The framework is based on
    the properties of trust that can be improved over time to indicate good quality
    data whose quality threshold is acceptable for a certain use case. Trust itself
    is a continuous assessment process. Throughout this process, trust can be formed,
    improved, or lost. This article defines three trust stages for evaluating data
    quality. This was informed by previous research in the field [4]. Fig. 3 shows
    how these relate to the big data model. Initial trust: This is trust that is derived
    without investigating the data itself but rather the context of the data. This
    includes investigating the source and equipment/sensors used, and metadata are
    also assessed. Metadata plays a key role in determining quality. Sensor types,
    manufacturer, deployment age, and calibration technique are features that affect
    data quality. Investigation trust: Trust that is derived from the data itself.
    This can relate to the raw data stream or stages of preprocessing the data has
    undertaken. This, among other parameters, can encompass data completeness or accuracy.
    A component of this can consider comparative analysis, comparing the data stream
    values against a community of sensors or comparative data streams. Stages of preprocessing
    may involve data stream modeling or data fusion. Both modeling and fused data
    can be used and evaluated in comparative analysis for trust determination. Result-driven
    trust: Data are used in systems modeling and decision-making. The result of these
    products can be monitored as effective decisions or accurate models. This monitored
    result can be used as a feedback mechanism throughout the stages of the big data
    model to build trust. This relates to the propagative property of trust [40].
    The result-driven feedback is an important facet to build trust in the absence
    of a gold standard and in a shared data environment. Fig. 3. Flow diagram showing
    the relationship between the big data model and trust formation stages. Show All
    The initial trust would help us define a trust score that represents data quality
    during data collection. Investigative trust defines a trust score that represents
    data quality during data prepossessing and data analytics. Finally, result-driven
    trust defines a trust score that represents data quality during data analytics
    and other data use processes. This ensures that data quality is represented across
    the entire big data model. A proposed data quality assessment framework is shown
    in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed framework that is based on trust formation stage.
    Show All The framework defines three phases: 1) starting phase (SP); 2) investigation
    phase (IP); and 3) results phase (RP). These are explained further in Section
    VI-C. At each of the phases, a phase trust score is calculated; SP n , IP n ,
    RP n by combining parameters and weights. For example, SP (SPn) is calculated
    with parameters ( a 1 , a 2 ,…, a 3 ) and weights ( w 1 , w 2 ,…, w 3 ) . Table
    III presents a nonexhaustive list of parameters. This is completed for each of
    the phases with the respective parameters and weights. After determining a phase
    trust score, a use-case-specific threshold is defined. Such weights can be learned
    through feedback from the previous stage for a particular use case. This is used
    to model the effects of the phases on each other. The framework then combines
    these with the experience metric and outputs a single end-to-end trust metric
    that can be used to evaluate data quality. TABLE III Parameters at Each Phase
    A. Framework Phases Three phases are defined that relate to the trust formation
    process. First, the framework will evaluate the context of the data by looking
    at aspects of the data; origin of data (reputation of the source), metadata. Second,
    the framework examines the data itself, assessing quality issues that exist in
    the data. Finally, the framework assesses use-case-specific results and their
    applicability to data quality. A predictive model use case may compare real and
    predicted values and attribute trust based on this. At each phase, the framework
    defines parameters a 1 to a n that define the dimensions of data quality used
    at each stage. B. Determining Weights The framework applies a set of linear weights
    to the attributes at each stage. The weights can be learned through the feedback
    process from the previous stage. This ensures that each use case can uniquely
    customize its own quality experience. C. Formulation of the Trust Metric The mathematical
    definition of SP, IP, and RP is illustrated further in Section VIII-B. The trust
    score of a data stream i is defined as T i = SP i + IP i + RP i +e (1) View Source
    where e is a metric called experience defined below. 1) Experience ( e ) The proposed
    framework uses experience e to model the natural behavior of trust. This is motivated
    by work conducted by Gao et al. [41]. The experience score is driven by positive
    and negative experiences. Therefore, the metric e of a given data stream i is
    defined as e i = ϑ i +1 ϑ i + δ i +2 (2) View Source where ϑ i is the count of
    positive experience toward data stream i , and δ i is the count of negative experience
    toward data stream i . Consider a data stream i , it is said to have positive
    e at time t if the trust score at time t−1 is greater than a threshold, else i
    shows a negative experience. At t=0 , ( ϑ i + δ i =0) , this means that data stream
    is new or has just started streaming. Therefore, experience is set to e i =0.5
    . This is informed by previous research in the field [42]. SECTION VII. End-to-End
    Implementation The proposed framework is tested via an end-to- end implementation
    of the data pipeline that is based on industry standard technologies and practices.
    The application development follows a microservice-based architecture that decomposes
    the application into a small set of complete self-contained services. This ensures
    that the framework can be seamlessly designed into any pipeline. This implementation
    aims to achieve the following goals. Decouple the mechanics of providing or advertising
    a quality score from the methods of evaluating quality. This allows different,
    competing, or updated metrics to be used to calculate trust without affecting
    the scoring mechanism. Describe the placement of the trust framework into big
    data pipelines. Evaluate the feasibility of end-to-end data quality assessment
    in terms of computing resources. The end-to-end data pipeline shown in Fig. 5
    is composed of four system components: these are mapped from the four phases of
    the big data phases described in Section I. This section describes the role of
    each component and the technologies used in each. Fig. 5. End-to-end implementation
    of the data pipeline. Show All A. Data Collection This phase of the data pipeline
    is concerned with data producers or data sources. These could be live sensors
    streaming to the cloud, historical data coming from a data warehouse/database,
    or data coming from a third-party application programming interface (API). Both
    live stream and historical data sources (batch processing) were considered for
    testing and evaluation. B. Data Preprocessing Two operations take place in the
    preprocessing block; first, the calculation of the initial trust described in
    Section VI as part of the trust framework is applied. The system checks if the
    initial trust meets this stage’s application data quality requirements. If satisfied,
    each data stream is tagged as good data and passed on to a Kafka node. Otherwise,
    that data can be tagged as usable data. In this case, the data can be improved
    by subsequent processing, and else, the data is discarded. Deciding what constitutes
    usable data is still an open research question. Second, a producer–broker–consumer
    mechanism is set up to receive data from the data producers (sensors). This in
    turn will present the data to the next part of the data pipeline (consumer). In
    a typical IoT data-shared environment, it is expected that a single data source
    can share its data with one or several data consumers each with different data
    quality requirements. The need for parallel distributed processing where a single
    input data source can be processed independently by each application is supported
    by Kafka and Zookeeper. Kafka, a distributed messaging system that is used for
    collecting and delivering high volumes of data with low latency [43]. Zookeeper
    is an orchestration server for Kafka. Fig. 6 shows the high-level architecture
    of Kafka. In the proposed system, each data consumer (spark application, described
    in Section VII-C) initializes a Kafka topic. This is the name of the source(s)
    from which it expects to receive data. A single application can subscribe to one
    or many Kafka topics. Each data source can only publish a single topic. Both Kafka
    and Zookeeper are run as microservices running on docker containers. The system
    can scale both horizontally and vertically. Fig. 6. Distributed Kafka architecture.
    Show All C. Data Processing and Analytics Data processing, real-time modeling,
    and data storage are performed by the data processing and analytics cluster. The
    second phase of trust calculation is conducted in this system component. To achieve
    the functionality of this subcomponent, the data needs to be processed in real-time
    as it is received. A spark streaming service is used to handle real-time data.
    Spark streaming is part of the core spark API that allows for real-time processing
    of data from various sources including Kafka, Flume, and Amazon Kinesis. This
    processed data can then be saved to file systems, databases, live dashboards,
    or even pushed to a Kafka node as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Spark streaming application.
    Show All The setup consists of one master node with two workers. Each spark application
    is initialized with a list of topics to which it listens. Each topic corresponds
    to a data source name that is part of the IoT data-sharing ecosystem. Both historical
    and real-time data can be assessed using this implementation. Historical data
    can be assessed in batches defined by a period. Real-time data is assessed on
    a continuous basis windowed by a period or sample size. The following operations
    take place using the calculated trust score. The trust score from the previous
    phase is aggregated with that of the current phase. If the trust score is lower
    than a threshold, operations can be performed here to improve the overall quality
    and a new trust score calculated. If the data does not meet the quality standards
    of the application, the current data source will be deemed unusable. D. Data Use
    The final component of the data pipeline considers data use. Data use operations
    such as data visualization and machine learning are typically applied in the BDC.
    RP trust is calculated based on the output of such operations. This requires feedback
    from the application. The feedback loop would help define the longitudinal relationship
    between the data quality properties at each stage of the big data model, and how
    these might affect or help improve the overall data quality of a data stream.
    For example, a prediction model application may return a prediction error based
    on the current data pipeline used. SECTION VIII. Trust Framework by Example To
    demonstrate the application of the proposed system, an example based on a dataset
    from an IoT deployment collected to measure air quality was used. The air quality
    dataset is comprised of two data streams: a gold reference sensor stream and an
    IoT sensor stream. Both are colocated and measure the same feature (carbon monoxide
    (CO) concentration). From each of these streams, a continuous trust metric is
    formed. The trust metric is built using three DQDs: 1) accuracy; 2) completeness;
    and 3) timeliness. The implementation of each of the metrics is defined in Section
    VIII-B. At any given time, a value of trust is given to the stream based on these
    DQDs and past trust scores (experience). The example is presented to, first, provide
    an implementation of trust and show the dynamics of the trust metric when evaluating
    a data stream, and second, to test and validate the trust mechanism. This is achieved
    in three stages. First, the trust metric of the known gold standard data stream
    is compared against the trust metric for colocated IoT data stream. This test
    indicates how trust can be used as a metric over multiple DQDs to differentiate
    between sources of varying quality. Second, trust is compared to known data quality
    metrics MAE and RMSE. The comparison will validate trust as an indicator of data
    quality. Should the defined trust metric show a strong correlation with the known
    data quality metrics over a range of data streams, we may conclude that the trust
    metric can indeed be a usable quality metric. Finally, the resource costs of implementing
    trust as a continuous quality metric are evaluated. The first evaluation is based
    on data from a CO sensor (referred to as the low-cost sensor) and a gold reference
    sensor. These are colocated and measure the same property. For each stream, DQDs
    at each stage are defined. These are used to calculate the trust score and subsequently
    experience for each stage. Finally, result scores from the initial and investigative
    stages are fused, resulting in a trust score for a stream. A naive approach using
    equal weighting linear fusion is applied in this example. Further investigation
    into fusion techniques will be conducted in future work. A second evaluation is
    based on the gold reference stream. The goal is to have a standard and generic
    way of evaluating data quality frameworks that are based on model performance.
    Models are usually the final step of most IoT data processes, and the previous
    research has shown a correlation between data quality and model performance [44].
    This can help establish a benchmark for all data quality frameworks across the
    IoT. The stream is modeled to generate five streams. The first stream is the original
    stream (no noise added). The other five streams are generated by randomly introducing
    noise to the original stream in varying proportions of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30%.
    The percentage is the overall size of the data stream. To generate the noise,
    NumPy’s random function was used [45]. This is based on the normal distribution
    and draws random samples. The size of the sample corresponds to the proportion
    of error, for example, 10%. The generated noise is then added to the original
    stream to create a new stream. For each stream, a trust metric is calculated.
    For each stream, a model is built and evaluated with two known metrics: 1) RMSE
    and 2) MAE. The framework is agnostic of the modeling technique. This example
    uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). A relationship exists
    between data quality and model performance [44]. As the data quality degrades,
    so does model performance, keeping other factors constant. This relationship is
    used as a way to evaluate the trust metric. If this relationship exists between
    the calculated trust metric and data quality, it can be concluded that the trust
    metric is a valid metric for describing data quality. Fig. 8 summarizes the data
    and process flow of the example. Fig. 8. Data and process flow of the example.
    Show All The final evaluation measures how the system resources are utilized as
    the data go through the data pipeline. Central processing unit (CPU) utilization
    of the system without the trust calculation and CPU utilization with the calculation
    of trust at each stage are compared. The delay introduced by trust calculation
    is also measured. The results and evaluations reported in is study are based on
    the starting and investigation phases of the framework highlighted in Fig. 4.
    The mechanism for the RP is still under study. In the SP, one DQD is considered,
    timeliness, and two DQDs in the IP, completeness and accuracy. To differ from
    previous studies that use the same DQDs by taking into account only the current
    state of a data stream, our implementation uses a trust approach based on past
    and present experience. Karkouch et al. [46] reported that because of the instantaneous
    nature of these DQDs, at some point, they will be either unreliable or become
    insignificant. For example, if a sensor dirty fails (sensor node fails, but keeps
    up reporting readings that are erroneous) under any circumstances, then the accuracy
    dimension is rendered insignificant and unreliable unless it is enhanced with
    past experience. These metrics are defined in Section VI-C. This implementation
    considers uniform weights for each DQD. Effective weight determination is still
    an open research question. A. Dataset Description The study uses a publicly available
    dataset that was collected from an IoT deployment (see reference [47]). A multisensor
    device was colocated with a conventional air pollution analyzer. This was used
    to provide the true concentration values of the target pollutants at the measurement
    site. These values were thus used as a gold standard. This dataset is suitable
    for testing as the discrepancies in quality between the streams are known and
    can be used for system evaluation. This study uses data from the CO sensor (referred
    to as a low-cost sensor) and the gold reference sensor. Fig. 9 shows hourly concentration
    estimation of CO over a one-week window. The red line represents the true concentration
    value as measured by the conventional analyzer colocated with the low-cost sensor
    whose values are shown by the blue line. Fig. 9. Hourly concentration measures
    of CO for the gold standard and low-cost sensors. Show All B. Mathematical Implementation
    A previous study [2] examines if a trust-based framework can be used to evaluate
    the quality of a data stream without a gold reference. This study expands on this
    to consider the first two phases (SP and IP) of the framework. This work is different
    from the previous study in that it implements evaluation over the big data model,
    evaluating a fundamental component of the proposed framework. The implementation
    and evaluation are conducted over two phases using: 1) timeliness and 2) accuracy
    and completeness DQDs. Following from (1), SPi and IPi are given by SP i = IP
    i = ( Timeliness )( w 1 ) ( Accuracy Completeness )( w 1 w 2 ). (3) (4) View Source
    1) Accuracy: This is widely considered as meaning a correct and unambiguous correspondence
    with the real world [48]. Ballou and Pazer [49] defined accuracy as the recorded
    value being in conformity with the actual value. This work defines the metric
    for accuracy following the definition by Blake and Mangiameli [48]: Accuracy:=1−
    V T N A (5) View Source where V T is the number of tuples in a relation having
    one or more incorrect values and N A is the total number of tuples. To determine
    V T , a statistical technique based on median absolute deviations (MADs) is used.
    Absolute deviation from the median has been used for a long time to filter outliers
    [50]. The median is a measure of central tendency and is preferred to the mean
    as it is less sensitive to the presence of outliers which can have an outsized
    effect in IoT. The median is also a location estimator that has the highest breakdown
    point. The following formula as defined by Huber [51] was used to calculate MAD:
    MAD=α M i (| x i − M j ( x j )|) (6) View Source where x j is the original observations,
    M j is the median of the series, and α is the data normalization constant defined
    by [52]. It is defined as α=(1/(Q(0.75)) , where Q(0.75) is the 0.75 quintile
    of that underlying distribution. The normalization step is important because otherwise
    MAD would estimate the scale up to a multiplicative constant [51] only. Fig. 10
    illustrates how the MAD was used to determine V T . To determine the tolerance
    factor, Miller [53] suggested three values: 2, 2.5, and 3 standard deviations.
    The choice will determine the sensitivity of the metric. Since IoT data is noisy,
    the extreme value of 3 was used to ensure that noisy data are not tagged as outliers.
    Fig. 10. Illustration of how MAD is implemented. Show All 2) Completeness: The
    metric for completeness is given by [48] and is defined as follows: on the level
    of data values, a data value is incomplete (i.e., the metric value is zero) if
    and only if it is “NULL”; otherwise, it is complete (i.e., the metric value is
    one). All data values that represent missing or unknown values in a specific application
    scenario (e.g., blank spaces or “9/9/9999” as a date value) are represented by
    the data value “NULL. ” For a relation R , let T R be the number of tuples in
    R that have at least one “NULL” value and let N R be the total number of tuples
    in R . Then, the completeness of R is defined as follows: Completeness:=1− T R
    N R = N R − T R N R . (7) View Source 3) Timeliness: The parameter for timelines
    of a data stream is affected by two components: currency, referring to the lag
    between when the data point was produced and when it was used or processed. The
    second, volatility, refers to how long the data point remains valid [54]. For
    some applications like accident avoidance in autonomous vehicles, this is very
    important. In others such as disease prediction in smart agriculture, the currency
    is less important. Unlike accuracy and completeness, timeliness is not determined
    directly from the data but rather by the context of the data. To this end, the
    metric for timelines is defined as Timeliness=[max(1− currency volatility ),0].
    (8) View Source C. Weighting the Scores Previous works [2] have two main drawbacks.
    Both previous and current experiences are weighted equally. The natural norm of
    trust assigns more weight to previous experiences when compared to current ones.
    The trust curve is biased by sudden changes in the data properties. The desired
    effect would be a gradual change for small changes in the data properties, with
    larger variations in trust occurring from larger data property changes. To mitigate
    the above effects, a weighted moving average that assigns more weight to past
    experiences when compared to current experiences is applied. This also reduces
    the effects of sudden increases and decreases in the trust curve due to small
    changes. Fig. 11 compares the trust score before and after weighting. The highlighted
    area shows how the effects of weights mitigate the above challenges. This is important
    in data-shared IoT where data is noisy and sudden changes in the data do not always
    relate to poor quality data. Fig. 11. Weighting trust scores using weighted moving
    average. Show All SECTION IX. Results and Evaluations To evaluate the trust metric,
    an experiment was set up to compare the trust metric to known statistical measures.
    The ARIMA forecasting model was used. Although multiple factors dictate a model’s
    performance, it is argued that the quality of the data that goes into the model
    is of most importance [44]. As the data quality changes, the assumption is that
    so does the model’s overall performance. Using the original gold reference stream,
    a trust score was calculated. Also, an ARIMA model is built and tested for the
    same stream. The results of the trust score are then compared to the RMSE and
    MAE. The process is repeated for the other generated streams. The correlation
    measures were based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. As it can be seen
    from both Table IV and Fig. 12, there is a strong negative correlation between
    the trust score and the RMSE and MAE. As the quality of the data degrades, the
    performance of the ARIMA model decreases. This is indicated by the increase in
    the values of RMSE and MAE. The same relationship exists between the trust score
    and data quality. As the quality of data degrades, so does the trust score. This
    shows that the proposed trust metric can act equivalently as known metrics like
    the RMSE. It is important to note that the trust metric is calculated without
    reference to a gold standard. This presents a significant opportunity to measure
    data quality in shared IoT where there is no gold reference to compare. TABLE
    IV Pearson Correlation Coefficients Between the Trust Score, RMSE, and MAE Fig.
    12. Comparing how the trust score, RMSE, and MAE changes in data impurities. Show
    All The metric for RMSE and MAE are solely based on the accuracy of DQDs. It was,
    therefore, not possible to evaluate how completeness and timeliness would affect
    such metrics. Trust metric, however, is a multidimensional metric that incorporates
    several DQDs depending on the user’s needs and application. This further illustrates
    the need for new ways to evaluate data quality. Future work will explore how to
    effectively compare the trust metric to other multidimensional metrics that support
    several DQDs. Fig. 13 presents the data quality differences between the gold reference
    sensor and the low-quality sensor. The aim here was to differentiate between two
    known data quality streams: 1) the gold reference and 2) the low-cost sensor.
    The green highlight in the Fig. 13 shows how both the gold reference and low-quality
    sensor’s trust decrease. During this period, the number of outliers increased
    by 2% for both the gold reference and low-quality sensors. The number of missing
    values, however, increased by 3% and 2% for gold reference and low-quality sensors,
    respectively. This accounts for the reduction in the trust scores for both sensors.
    Fig. 13. Comparing trust scores for the gold reference sensor and low-cost sensor.
    Show All In the first red highlight, there are inconsistencies in the trust scores
    for the gold reference and low-quality sensors, with that of the low-quality sensor
    being lower. During this period, the data authors [47] reported that after the
    30th week (starting march 2004), there was sensor drifting. This was later corrected
    by the calibration of the sensors. This sensor drift was detected by the trust
    mechanism and resulted in a lower trust score for this period. After calibration,
    the trust score returns to high values. The detection of sensor drift and its
    impact on data quality has previously shown to be difficult to measure. In the
    last red highlight, there was a 13% increase in the number of missing values for
    the low-quality sensor. This explains the overall decrease in the trust score
    during this period. The trust metric, therefore, helps describe the quality of
    each data stream independently without relying on the other and shows the effects
    of different DQDs in a single metric. This type of comparison over multiple DQDs
    is not possible with existing techniques. As part of the evaluation process, the
    impact of the trust computation framework on the data pipeline in terms of system
    resources (percentage CPU usage) and the delay introduced in the data pipeline
    due to trust calculation was monitored. Fig. 14 shows a higher percentage usage
    of compute resources for a data pipeline with trust computation when compared
    to the same job without trust computation. On average, there was a 7.8% increase
    in CPU usage for jobs with trust calculation. On average, there is a delay introduced
    into the data pipeline due to trust calculation. This is not an in- process delay,
    but rather compounded total delay from the start of the job to the end. Not with
    standing this the data is still delivered. The results reported here compare system
    performance as the number of nodes in the clusters increases (up to four worker
    nodes). Each of the worker’s nodes has six cores and 4 GB. As shown in Table V,
    as the number of worker nodes increases, the delay decreases from 10.6 to 4.2
    min. Since the delay is caused by an extra process (trust calculation), and spark
    is a distributed processing engine, increasing the number of nodes in the cluster
    would minimize or even eliminate such a delay. This demonstrates the scalability
    of the system. TABLE V System Resource Utilization Fig. 14. Comparing data pipeline
    resource consumption. Show All SECTION X. Application: When to Disconnect From
    a Data Source Data deriving from IoT can help foster innovations and save lives.
    Performing analytics on this data is, however, challenging due to the heterogeneity,
    complexity, and dynamic nature of IoT. Therefore, businesses and organizations
    have to maintain redundant data sources, seek third-party sources, or a few that
    can afford them, and install high-end sensors to mitigate such heterogeneity within
    the data. The process of deciding which data source to engage and disengage is
    largely based on the quality of data from such a source. This is typically performed
    manually after the data has been processed. Data generation, collection, and delivery
    in IoT are automated and so should the process of selecting and maintaining a
    data source. Current data quality metrics are instantaneous, that is, a data source
    is evaluated based on its current state only, without previous context. Given
    the dynamic, heterogeneity, and high volatility of IoT data, this would result
    in a high variance in network connection due to disconnecting from a data source
    each time there is a change in the data properties. This problem is exacerbated
    by low bandwidth and intermittent network disruptions that affect most IoT deployments.
    The trust metric, however, has been modeled to mitigate this problem. One of the
    novel elements of the trust score is its experience metric. This helps to incorporate
    the past and current context of a data source and also ensures that sudden changes
    in the data properties do not lead to sudden changes in the trust metric. This
    feature is further improved by the weighting strategy implemented in Section VIII-C.
    To illustrate the application, data collected from weather stations between 2015
    and 2019 in the United Kingdom was used. The data is produced at an interval of
    15 min. Each weather station generates an average of 30000 data points every year
    with over 100 weather stations. This includes air temperature, rainfall, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. Agricultural applications dynamically connect to and
    retrieve data from these stations. In a data-shared IoT environment, applications
    should be able to dynamically select a data source, a weather station, for example,
    based on its data quality needs. Figs. 15 and 16 show two applications each with
    a different trust score threshold (0.98 and 0.95), each connected to a different
    weather station. Each application would advertise its threshold. In each case,
    the application would then automatically disengage from the data source when its
    trust score falls below the application’s threshold and would automatically be
    connected to another data source of sufficient quality. While the thresholds determined
    in the figures are somewhat arbitrary, the method can be used to allow different
    applications to prescribe different levels of quality for their given use case.
    Each application and use case can set its own threshold. This can then be used
    to disengage from a data source. Fig. 15. Application with a higher threshold.
    Show All Fig. 16. Application with a lower threshold. Show All This kind of automation
    can be used in other applications, for example: Automate data source repairs and
    maintenance. Continued disengagement from a data source could mean it is faulty.
    Gradual decrease in data quality could be associated with sensor drift. Therefore,
    the sensor can be automatically reset back to where its known data quality was
    good. SECTION XI. Conclusion and Future Work This article has described an end-to-
    end implementation of a trust framework that can be used to estimate the quality
    of data. The implementation was evaluated using data collected from a real-world
    experiment. The implementation is based on industry-standard data pipelines with
    Kafka as distributed messaging service and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
    This is unique as it integrates with all the stages of the big data model. To
    the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end data quality assessment
    framework implementation. This implementation enables one to estimate data quality
    in cases where there is no gold standard to compare. The other advantage is that
    one would be able to represent data quality in a general manner throughout the
    big data model. To evaluate the system, the article compares the trust score to
    RMSE and MAE. Using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, the results and evaluations
    showed that the trust metric is a good metric for data quality assessment in cases
    where there is no gold standard, which is the case in data-shared IoT. Although
    the results have shown a slight increase in system resources in terms of CPU and
    execution time, this can be mitigated with distributed processing. The article
    listed several challenges related to data quality assessment, both structural
    and method-related challenges. We have explored how some of these can be solved
    by the implementation described using real-world datasets. However, some challenges
    remain: for example, we equally combine the trust scores for the different phases.
    There is a need for a fusion algorithm that accounts for the contribution of each
    stage. Also, the mechanism for feedback and how this propagates from the RP is
    not yet fully formed. These and other challenges highlighted above form part of
    our future work. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

  description: The ability to conduct useful science under the framework of precision

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Miami, FL, USA SECTION I. Introduction UAS
    have been shown to be useful tools providing high performance and cost-effective
    solutions in a diverse range of areas. Schwartzbach et. Al. [1] successfully implemented
    UAS for sampling water of remote wetland ecosystems. In urban environments, UAS
    were shown to be a cost-effective and flexible platform for traffic monitoring
    by Kanistras et. Al. [2]. Henrickson et. Al. [3] demonstrated capability of using
    a combination of fixed-wing and rotorcrafts to perform infrastructure assessments.
    Other UAS applications have included real-time river flooding assessment [4],
    river mapping for water management [5]–[6] and rangeland surveillance [7]. A growing
    area of interest for UAS application is precision agriculture. Anderson [8] indicated
    the importance of UAS in spatial ecology in 2013. The challenge of providing high
    quality and timely actionable information will only continue to grow in importance
    over the coming years, and UAS stand to greatly facilitate the collection of high
    quality imagery data focused on precision agriculture. Rotorcraft have been used
    for precision sensing due to the capability to hover. Primicerio et. Al. proposed
    a six-rotor UAS capable of flying autonomously with a multi-spectral camera [9].
    Candón showed that UAS has the ability to monitor crops at a small scale. Rotorcraft
    UAS are restricted with payload and flight time. Valasek et. Al.[10] used multispectral
    sensors with fixed-wing UAS to image corn and cotton providing large coverage
    as well as high resolution. The Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES)
    and Texas A&M AgriLife Research jointly supported a two year internal effort that
    focused on developing and demonstrating precision agriculture capabilities for
    the science mission using both fixed-wing and rotorcraft-based platforms. The
    goal was to develop an expandable system that is capable of providing a modular
    platform for multi-sensor integration. The Texas A&M Vehicle Systems and Control
    Laboratory (VSCL) was the lead organization in this effort, with a specific objective
    of investigating the suitability of fixed-wing UAS for precision agriculture.
    The traditional paradigm for most science applications of UAS such as precision
    agriculture has been that good science is a function of using good sensors + data
    reduction. This paradigm is not correct because there is currently a gap between
    Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) UAS and research purposed unmanned vehicles that
    can carry and properly fly high performance sensors. For customizable sensor integration,
    Commercial UAS are starting to be equipped with autopilots, sensors, and simple
    data processing software, but are often limited to carrying only one sensor. Additionally,
    there is often a lack of cross platform integration expandability. This gap negatively
    impacts the science mission. This paper seeks to address this gap by proposing
    a new paradigm for good science and validating it with results from precision
    agriculture. This new paradigm is that good science is a function of the UAS vehicle
    + good sensors + properly integrated and tuned sensors + how the UAS is flown
    + data reduction. Each of these factors may seem obvious and perhaps redundant
    but in fact each of them has a significant effect on the quality of imagery collected,
    and ignoring or not properly addressing any of them any of them is shown to be
    problematic. The work and results addressed in this paper seek to develop methodologies
    and procedures for fixed-wing precision agriculture, including sensor selection,
    vehicle platform selection, flight operations and permissions, data collection
    flights in real-world precision agriculture scenarios, and assessment of collected
    imagery and data. The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the
    sensor selection, vehicle platform selection, vehicle modification, avionics,
    as well as providing justification for these selections in the context of precision
    agriculture applications. Section III details the developed flight planning procedures
    for operating these systems for precision agriculture purposes. Section IV provides
    detailed post flight sensor specific data processing procedure. Sections V and
    VI provide some concluding thoughts and describe extensions of this work. SECTION
    II. Flight Hardware A. Sensors Two primary sensors were selected for testing and
    demonstration purposes. The first is a ICI 8640 P-series UAV calibrated thermal
    camera with temperature measurement. The sensor uses a Banana Pi as the control
    and storage module and provides CAN bus input for GPS triggering. The sensor system
    draws 3 Wand weighs around 0.55 lbs, with dimensions of 1.8×1.53×1.49 inches.
    When set to pixel-resolution of 640×512 , the frame rate for the sensor is approximately
    30 Hz and provides accuracy of ± 1 ∘ C . The second sensor is a Sentek GEMS Multispectral
    Sensor (Figure 2), a light-weight stand-alone unit with dual 1.3-megapixel (MP)
    CMOS sensors for visual (RGB) and near infrared (NIR) imagery collection that
    costs approximately $1500. The unit weighs 0.57 lbs, has dimensions of 3.5×5.0×2.0
    inches, and has a built in inertial navigation system (INS) and GPS antenna. When
    set to 1.3-MP images, the Sentek sensor is capable of recording an image (both
    RGB and NIR) once every 1.4 seconds. The decision to include a multispectral sensor
    in this project was driven by interest in scenarios in assessing soil and vegetation.
    This particular multispectral sensor was selected based on extensive prior experience
    in using it for imaging crop fields. The Sentek sensor, in comparison with other
    tested multispectral sensors, proved to be the most reliable and user-friendly,
    and achieved the most consistently high quality imagery data. Fig. 1: ICI 8640P-series
    with control module Show All Fig. 2: Sentek GEMS multispectral sensor (with and
    without outer case) Show All B. Fixed-Wing UAS Systems The small UAS is the ReadyMadeRC
    Anaconda shown in Figure 4 has an empty weight of 5.3 pounds, a wingspan of 6.8
    feet, and can carry a payload of 4 pounds for 45–60 minutes. The airframe was
    designed to only fly for roughly 15 minutes, so modifications had to be made to
    the power system in order to achieve the greater endurance. In order to achieve
    this, two 14.8v 5000 mAh lithium polymer battery (LiPo) packs were mounted in
    the nose in parallel to achieve 10,000 mAh of power. This larger amount of power
    allows the Fig. 3: Payload mounting system Show All Anaconda to gain the long
    endurance needed to perform large data collecting missions. In theory, adding
    larger batteries can increase the flight time. However, due to the fuselage design
    of the Anaconda, free payload space exists within the nose to the trailing edge
    of the wing, batteries with more capacity shifts the Center of Gravity (CG) to
    forward CG, resulting a nose heavy flight and reduction of performance. Originally
    intended for first-person view (FPV) hobbyists, an Anaconda airframe costs roughly
    $400 and is designed to easily accommodate sensors in its fuselage. Out of the
    box, the airframe includes mounting brackets for installing a GoPro camera in
    either a fixed position looking forward, or on a gimbal mount hanging underneath
    nose. The Anaconda airframe was selected primarily for its low-cost, its durable
    foam construction, and its relatively large and easily retrofitted to be able
    to accept almost any sensor. The Sentek sensor was placed around the CG point
    to ensure aircraft stability. Major airframe modifications were also needed to
    mount the sensor in the correct position and enable quick payload adjustments
    in the field. A center section of foam was removed from the underside of the fuselage,
    and a 3D-printed multi-hole mounting structure was installed as in Figure 3. The
    mounting system is a light-weight and sturdy system that enables the capability
    of switching the sensors easily while maintaining structural integrity and ensuring
    both the Sentek and ICI cameras have a clear view of the ground at all times.
    The sensors were mounted using foam tape and zip-ties to minimize vibrations and
    sensor shift. Extra mounting plates were added in the fuselage to mount the autopilot
    system and increase the structural rigidity of the fuselage. Once the sensors
    were installed, the Anaconda was flown to assure that aircraft maintained its
    original flying qualities. Anaconda was the UAS of choice for VSCL precision agriculture
    research data collection for the past two years, in which over 133 flights were
    conducted for data collection over the course of 12 months. Fig. 4: VSCL anaconda
    fleet Show All Fig. 5: Pixhawk flight computer Show All C. Avionics The flight
    controller used for the Anaconda mission flights is the Pixhawk flight controller
    [11] The system runs an open-source ArduPlane firmware on a 32-bit STM32f427 Cortex
    M4 with a processing speed of 186MHz. The system along with the digital airspeed
    sensor shown in Figure 6 measures important state information such as airspeed,
    roll, pitch, yaw angles, and logs flight control commands and flight system status
    that can be useful for post-flight analysis. SECTION III. Flight Planning Flight
    planning is an inherent process for data acquisition UAS flights for precision
    agriculture purposes. Seasonal prevailing wind direction and wind intensity, sensor
    specific distance between passes, image over-lap, image side-lap, ground control
    point location, and auto-triggering cycle time are all crucial for quality data
    collection. The ultimate goal of IR/NIR flight path design is to improve mosaic
    quality under a restricted time frame. Flight time is restricted due to the inherit
    nature of large fluctuations with infrared signals. Image quality can be increased
    by reducing flight speed induced motion blur, reducing cross wind paths, and increasing
    image overlap and sidelap. In the following subsections the key factors of a successful
    flight planning is discussed. Fig. 6: Digital pitot tube Show All Fig. 7: Prevailing
    wind direction from july-october at brazos bottoms farm. Show All A. Prevailing
    Wind Prevailing wind intensity is crucial for both the reduction of cross wind
    flight paths and the necessary speeds for take-off and landing. Cross wind during
    flight reduces the accuracy of the waypoint tracking and increases the vehicle
    bank angle, and as a result, increases the complexity of image mosaicing. Due
    to the nature of UAS image acquisition flight environment, the vehicle usually
    carries payloads close to the maximum take-off capacity on unpaved dirt roads
    with limited take-off/landing space. Therefore, by carefully utilizing the seasonal
    prevailing wind, both the percentage of cross wind flight paths and take-off/landing
    distance can be minimized. The direction and intensity of prevailing wind during
    the past three years from July to October at Brazos Bottoms Farm is shown in Figure
    7. Wind speed from 0 to 40 miles/hr are shown in different shaded colors. Prevailing
    wind during the July-October period is the south south east(SSE) direction 150deg±20
    deg with the highest probability of wind speeds 10≤ W s ≤15 miles/hour. It is
    essential to avoid flight path planning with frequent cross wind flight paths.
    B. Waypoint Scheduling Conventional waypoint designs for UAS rotorcrafts is shown
    in subfigure (a) and subfigure (b) in Figure 8. Common issues with the standard
    and cross-stitch waypoint scheduling methods are that the high banking angles
    required for agile turns are not easily achieved with fixed-wing UAS. Additionally,
    agile maneuvers for fixed-wing UAS often results in missed ground control points
    as well as images with high banking angles, which leads to imagery with bad mosaic
    results. From multiple imagery flight test experience, a moving box waypoint design
    method was developed. An example of the moving box method is shown in Figure 9.
    The advantage of this method is that it can reduce the commanded banking angle
    and does not require large control surface maneuvers. Note that Figure 8 and Figure
    9 are examples generated in Mission Planner especially for the purpose of displaying
    waypoint scheduling concept. Using the moving box method, the waypoints are scheduled
    in rectangular box shaped patterns while gradually moving along one direction.
    The pattern can be scheduled either clockwise or counter-clockwise according to
    the wind direction and is specific mission dependent. Issues with the moving box
    method lay on the imagery coverage of the center region. Figure 10 shows a mosaiced
    result from a flight conducted on May 21st, 2016 at the Texas A&M farm, using
    moving box method with low and missed center coverage. This was a result of a
    deviation from preset course due to strong wind with changing directions and a
    lack of defined way points along each lap. To overcome this issue, modifications
    were implemented on the flight planning including adding extra waypoints resurveying
    the center region and increasing overlapping in areas vulnerable to low coverage.
    The updated results will be discussed in Section V. Ground control points (GCP)
    are important for image mosaicking and geo-referencing. Pix4Dmapper (Pix4D SA,
    Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to mosaic images in this study. Geo-tagged images
    along with the GCPs are imported into Pix4D. Pix4D was selected because it is
    one of the most popular and mature UAS image mosaicking software for agricultural
    applications on the market. To create high quality mosaics with less distortion,
    it is recommended to have at least 75 % of forward-overlap between successive
    images and 60 % sidelap between flying tracks. This is sufficient for flights
    with low wind measurements, however, in flight days that wind gusts are above
    15 mph, when the vehicle is in a turn, the cross winds induce the vehicle to bank
    above the banking threshold that is required for good imaging. It is at these
    situations when the GCPs are important for counteract purposes. While the accuracy
    of mosiacs increases with the number of GCPs, four GCPs are required for mosaic
    corrections. Figure 11 compares the desired imagery area with the result of mosaiced
    image for a flight conducted on October 1st, 2016. As shown in the left subfigure,
    the orange box is the region of interest, the blue box as the flight plan area,
    and the white triangular points are the GCPs. Although the desired imaging area
    is small, larger area was sometimes flown over in order to include the permanently
    installed GCPs nearby to ensure good mosaics. Details about the GCPs used in this
    study can be find in our previous publication [12]. Fig. 8: (A) Conventional flight
    path planning. (b) Cross-stitch flight path planning. Show All Fig. 9: Moving
    box flight path planning. Show All C. Waypoint Auto-Triggering There are several
    COTS autopilot software that provides auto-triggering capability. Mission Planner
    provides triggering according to distance or triggering according to a fixed time
    interval. For fixed-wing imaging flights, the first approach often results in
    an skewed distribution of images throughout a flight path. This is the result
    of either the delay time in the autopilot system adjusting to wind gusts and therefore
    miscalculating the distance traveled or reduction of speed when the vehicle is
    banking. Consequently, the latter method is preferred and executed at VSCL. Figure
    12 is an illustrative example of a mission that utilized fixed time interval auto
    triggering and Table I shows the sensor configurations that are taken into account
    upon waypoint planning. When flying at 122 m (400 ft.) AGL, the field-of- view
    of the Sentek multispectral camera on the ground was 106.19 m (width) and 84.95
    m (height), and was 76.05 m (width) and 57.04 m (height) for the ICI thermal camera.
    The corresponding ground sampling distance was about 8.6 cm for Sentek camera
    and 11.5 cm for ICI camera. Fig. 10: Number of overlapping images for each pixel
    of the orthomasaic in pix4d. Red and yellow areas indicate low overlap for which

    SECTION IV. Data Processing Data processing consists of both post-flight data
    selection and pre-mosaic handling. In order to accommodate the differences in
    different sensors, a package written in MATLAB® for image geo-tagging and filtering
    out images with undesired banking and pitching angles. Flight logs from the Pixhawk
    was also analyzed for the purpose of data processing. Figure 13 shows the roll,
    pitch, and yaw attitude of the vehicle during a mission. It can be seen that the
    vehicle is often at a high roll angle ϕ when it is in turning patterns. In this
    particular case, images with pitch angles larger than θ=± 10 ∘ and banking angle
    ϕ=± 8 ∘ were excluded from further processing. The ICI thermal camera did not
    come with an GPS unit. To eliminate the potential interference between multiple
    GPS units, the GPS stamp at each trigger point from the UAS autopilot was matched
    with the images in the post-flight processing. At each instance of triggering
    during a flight, the onboard flight computer sends a HIGH or LOW PWM signal through
    the CAN bus input port to the sensor control module and logs the UNIX time on
    the micro SD card. The PWM toggle creates a short voltage difference that activates
    a trigger event on the sensor. Non-geo-tagged images are then analyzed using the
    post-flight data processing software package for geotagging purposes. An open-source
    Perl based ExifTool [13] is used to read, write and edit meta information on each
    image. The geo-location information is critical for generating successful mosaics.
    The Sentek multispectral sensor provides both altitude trigger mode and manual
    trigger mode for auto-trigger at a specified time interval. Altitude trigger mode
    utilized the compatible GPS system, starts triggering at a specified interval
    after the prescribed altitude is reached. In this mode it has been shown to be
    less reliable due to the interference of GPS signal and is not preferred in this
    paper albeit its convenience on flight operation. Continuous trigger mode immediately
    starts triggering after activation and is terminated after a human operator finalizes
    the mission, providing a high success rate for image capturing. The sensor automatically
    geo-tags the GPS coordinates along with INS information on each image. However,
    due to the fixed time interval automatic trigger, post flight selection of data
    is required before mosaic. Hard banking angle ϕ and pitching angle θ thresholds
    were imposed on the images taken. SECTION V. Results All the flight tests were
    conducted at Texas A&M AgriLife Research''s Brazos Bottom Farm in Burleson County,
    Texas (headquarters at 30.549635N, 96.436821W). The objective was to apply the
    developed flight procedures to successfully capture quality data for on a single
    vehicle using multiple sensors. Figure 14 shows the actual flight path in Lat-Long
    coordinates with a planned flight path as shown in Figure 12 of the June 24th,
    2016 flight. 303 images were collected through trigger toggles and geo-tagged
    through post flight processing. The blue line indicates the flight path of the
    vehicle, green crosses are the planned waypoint location in the flight plan through
    Mission Planner, and the red plus signs show the actual trigger command GPS location
    in the flight. The geo-tagged images provide high correlation between the initial
    and computed image positions in the xz-plane, within a short process time using
    Pix4D. The system-logged GPS locations were also very close to the actual locations
    computed by Pix4D in the XZ plane (Figure 15) and resulted with faster processing
    in Pix4D. In the left subfigure of Figure 15, the red dots indicate disabled or
    uncalibrated images with the green and blue dots as the computed and initial positions.
    Including initial sensor testing flights, a total of 11 flight days with 27 flights
    were flown between the 2016 June-July period. The geo-tagging function was only
    tested in the last two flights and succeeded in both flights. Figure 16 shows
    where raw images were taken and we can see a uniform triggering along the flight
    path. Figure 17 shows sufficient and uniform overlap between images. The right
    subfigure shows the number of overlapping images computed for each pixel for the
    orthomosaic. Red and yellow areas indicate low overlap for which poor results
    may be generated. Green areas indicate an overlap of over 5 images for every pixel.
    Good quality results will be generated as long as the number of keypoint matches
    is also sufficient for these areas. Fig. 14: Geo-tagged location for the thermal
    images Show All Figure 18 shows the mosaic of the thermal data successfully generated
    from the the geo-tagged data shown in Figure 15. Good path planning and coverage
    as well as the geo-tagging resulted with minimal distortion and artifacts which
    can be observed in this mosaic. The brighter the pixel color, the high the temperature
    of that pixel. The cooler pixels on the edges correspond to dense vegetation between
    fields and water areas. There are obvious temperature variations in the center
    field area. This is an important application in precision agriculture as the temperature
    variation in the field is often correlated with crop stresses, such as water stress,
    disease or pest stress. Stresses can possibly cause reduced stomatal openings
    and evapotranspiration rate which would increase the canopy temperature. This
    thermal mosaic can also be used to give advice for irrigation management. Locations
    shown in the figure with higher temperature are possibly the areas with sparse
    stands or relatively drier than those locations shown with lower temperature.
    The mosaic is complete without any gap and distortion which indicated a successful
    implementation of onboard auto-triggering system. Similar success was achieved
    for multispectral imaging using the Sentek camera. Flight test results have indicated
    a ϕ< 8 ∘ and θ< 10 ∘ as a good rule of thumb for the restrictions for image selection.
    Figure 19 shows the flight path of the October 1st, 2016, 3975 images were taken
    at the interval of 0.7 sec and 2023 images were within the constraint limit. Process
    time in Pix4D was significantly reduced from several days to around an hour using
    the preselected images due to the high correlation between the initial and computed
    image positions, and therefore, no process time was spent on calculating an impossible
    solution. Figure 20 shows the mosaiced imagery. Utilizing the developed pre- flight
    and post flight data processing methods the resulting mosaic provides 100 percent
    coverage of the target field with no images discarded. Note that the bright-and-dark
    strips along the flight path in the mosaics were caused by the rapid-changing
    environmental illumination during that particular test date. For strict spectral
    sensing in agricultural applications, we recommend to conduct flights during solar
    noons in cloud-free days. The post-flight data selection method was implemented
    for only one flight due to the completion of the project. Fig. 15: Results of
    computed tie point positions in pix4d. (a) Top view. (b) Front view of X-Z plane.

    The green line follows the position of the images in time starting from the large
    blue dot. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusions This paper proposed a new paradigm
    for realizing good science in precision agriculture missions Procedures and methodologies
    for achieving this paradigm were developed and demonstrated for the collection
    of high quality sensor data using fixed-wing Unmanned Air Systems. The paper also
    addressed vehicle platform selection, sensor selection and their integration,
    sensor tuning, and carefully designed flight operations. It also addressed the
    design of missions to adhere to flight permissions and restrictions while still
    allowing the collection of quality imagery. The methodology and procedures were
    validated by assessment of collected imagery and data from flights conducted on
    actual plots. Based upon the results presented in the paper, it is concluded that
    the proper matching of vehicle characteristics to sensor characteristics, proper
    flight planning and mission design, and use of auto-triggering of the sensor produces
    better data quality and improved mosaicking in terms of image quality metrics
    and percentage of coverage for mosaics. The approach is judged to be a promising
    candidate for improved data collection for precision agriculture. Fig. 17: Number

    4.0, Water ManagementSustainability Introduction Agriculture must change. The
    excessive use of phytosanitary products, soil tillage techniques, and production
    must necessarily adapt to meet current challenges. Climate change, depletion of
    fossil resources, environmental issues (protection of biodiversity, fight against
    pollution, etc.), and health require a change of model to tend towards more sustainability
    [1], [2]. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is taking advantage
    of recent advances in energy consumption in electronic systems and energy harvesting
    technologies to build intelligent control entities used in various fields such
    as agriculture [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Thanks to the ever-lower
    power consumption of radiofrequency communication circuits, it is possible to
    create networks of sensor systems capable of extracting data from the environment
    and transmitting it to a master entity. However, the limited lifetimes of batteries
    are an obstacle to developing such networks for cost and difficulty of maintenance.
    On the other hand, thanks to the energy recovery in the environment, whether solar,
    thermal, or mechanical, it is possible to power a sensor system and its wireless
    communication to increase the network''s overall autonomy [11], [12], [13], [14],
    [15]. Energy harvesting provides an attractive solution for IoT applications such
    as low-power wireless sensor systems, enabling fully wireless devices to be deployed,
    requiring little or no maintenance. However, these devices generally still need
    a rechargeable battery or a supercapacitor to meet peak power demands. Energy
    harvesting designates a technology intended to capture energy from the environment
    (or human activity) in order to be able to then operate an electronic device.
    Like renewable energies, energy harvesting enhances the energy sources naturally
    present in our environment. This technology provides a reasonably limited power
    (of the order of a few watts only) but is thus ideally suited for connected objects,
    which consume little energy. In addition, several energies can be harvested for
    energy harvesting. This is particularly the case with solar energy, wind power,
    thermal energy, and energy from vibrations. Renewable energy harvesting came from
    agricultural residues and energy crops for innovative agriculture applications
    [16]. For several years, many researchers have strived to find new sources of
    energy that are always “cleaner” and more environmentally friendly. Capable of
    transforming chemical energy into electrical energy, the biofuel cell differs
    from its predecessor in its composition: 100% natural components, therefore biodegradable,
    far from the harmful and polluting effects of metals such as manganese or platinum.
    Glucose, bacteria, and even plants are now the ambassadors of more environmentally
    friendly biofuel cells. There have been many works that have used renewable energy
    sources for agricultural applications to extend network lifetime. Faced with environmental
    pollution, innovative solutions are increasingly sought to change our modes of
    production and consumption of energy. For example, scientists have found in energy
    harvesting a way to produce batteries that are not harmful to the environment:
    biopiles. The latter is different from traditional batteries by their composition.
    Made of natural components, the biopile draws its energy from the environment
    without polluting it in return. Plants, glucose, and even bacteria can be used
    to create a 100% biodegradable battery. The latter uses chemical energy to generate
    electrical power. IoT sensors, ranging from simple thermometers to drones, have
    been democratized on farms. They can now collect a multitude of information from
    across the farm and transmit real-time data on the condition and performance of
    machinery, crops, and animals. The acquisition of a large volume of data is the
    basis of Agriculture 4.0. Nevertheless, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential
    to extract the full richness of this data. AI is, therefore, the lever that will
    enable tomorrow''s connected farmers to be supported throughout their production
    activities and to optimize their economic performance while reducing their environmental
    impact. The collection of data on the whole farm and the integration of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) algorithms will provide more and more valuable services to optimize
    the management of a farm. These tools will allow understanding of certain situations,
    making decisions more quickly, and capitalizing on the phenomena and the problems
    already encountered. The objectives are to reduce the drudgery of work, to produce
    more while minimizing costs and environmental impact. However, the farmer will
    remain the sole decision-maker for all strategic tasks, and each farmer will be
    able to choose and personalize his production path. The business expertise will
    always complement the information provided by AI. Moreover, the time saved by
    all these tools will allow the farmer to concentrate on the tasks requiring imperative
    human intervention. In this work a conceptual solution for the agricultural process
    was proposed at data management''s level. The Oracle Database 11 g was used. The
    solution stores rainfall, temperature, and drought status in the raw format described
    by farmers. In addition, Excel files were used to fill in the crop statistics
    data. Furthermore, we proposed an AI-based architecture for Smart Farming. This
    architecture called, Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture (SFOBA), should
    be designed to guarantee the system''s durability, the employment of the data
    modeling to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics. The
    goal is to provide a strategy for data ingestion that meets the data model while
    processing and storing the farm data, considering the Data Quality management
    and the System Configuration. The proposed architecture is built in layers to
    guarantee sustainability. It should handle the variety of sources and the large
    workloads considering the fault tolerance. Each data source has its particularity
    regarding data structure and types that should be handled at the data model''s
    level. Intelligent farming analytics requires processing data in batch and real-time.
    The architecture should enable these capabilities, whether on-premise or on a
    cloud platform. That allows farmers to have more flexibility while accessing the
    data (from Smartphones, Tablets, etc.) using only the internet connection. The
    solution also requires having a single “source of truth” to all the intelligent
    farming analytics, the data lake (built-in layers). All technical controls and
    farming business rules verifications can be easily executed with this solution.
    It also allows to detect the data anomalies and cleaning them before storing them.
    Data scientists and data visualization tools will also process the farmers. This
    paper will be organized as follows: Section “Data Modeling for Smart Farming”
    exploits the difference between the most crucial data modeling methodologies Ralph-Kimball
    and Data vault and determining which one fits better the smarting farming analytics.
    Section “Data Migration Strategy for Smart Farming” focuses on the data migration
    strategies. Section “Smart Farming Oriented Big Data Architecture” describes the
    data ingestion strategy along with the smart farming-oriented Big Data Architecture.
    An overview of data science in smart agriculture is given in Section “Data Science
    for Smart Farming”. Section “Predictive Maintenance in Smart Farming” describes
    the algorithm for smart farming analysis and predictive maintenance. Finally,
    we conclude the paper in Section “Conclusion”. Data modeling for smart farming
    The success of data-driven analytics for smart farming is related to how organized
    the data management. This, in turn, means developing actions, policies, and architectures
    to manage the fundamental requirements of the data life cycle of the farm in a
    proper manner and align the technologies with the farming business needs. The
    development of data architecture for smart-farming involves accurate rules, data
    models, data storage, data processing, and integration [17], [18], [19], [20],
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Therefore, a well-designed data model should be
    built to define and analyze the data requirements. This includes: (1) the farm
    databases/sources; (2) the relationships between the data items; (3) data constraints;
    (4) conceptual representation of the data-Structure. When it comes to big data
    modeling, some of these gaps should be addressed in priority: (1) Integrating
    the existing farming data with the new one, on top of a Hadoop architecture, (2)
    Making the farm''s data available for processing in multitenant-infrastructures
    and accessible via shared access; (3) Supporting writable serialization format
    (used by Hadoop) and other serialization frameworks, e.g., Avro, Thrift, and Protocol
    Buffers; (4) Supporting columnar formats; (5) Compression (e.g., LZO, Snappy,
    Gzip, bzip2) improves data processing performance and reduces storage requirements.
    Thus, the farming business requirements should be “melt” within the logical data
    model. Then, determine how the various farm data sources will fit together and
    how they can be mapped to flow in one source (the farm data lake). The relational
    data model was proposed to represent data in tables to reduce the complexity of
    the “previous” hierarchical model and deliver a comprehensible overview of the
    data. In the same context, the transactional data model can be built to store
    discrete data of the “farm” business transactions like inventory, purchase orders,
    sales, etc. It is mainly how the DMP (data management platform) are modeled in
    their source system, throughout the procedure of normalizing the large raw-tables
    and splitting them into smaller ones, then creating relationships between these
    tables using reference integrity constraints and respecting the 3 Normal Forms
    (3NF). However, the problem with this approach in smart farming analytics that
    it is area/business specific where each database stores only the data related
    to a specific functional area. On the other hand, smart farming analytics necessitates
    storing transactional data for multiple regions like spatial distribution (including
    climate, productivity, and global-issues data), water management, and mechanical
    system maintenance in a single “target” source (data lake). The second problem
    is that transactional databases use the primary key (specially to normalize the
    data). Still, in smart farming, the DGM (Data Generated by Machine) and DHO (Data
    from Human Origin) come without a primary key. As a result, we will have duplicates
    in our tables, which will have a significant impact on the analytics and the decisions.
    The third problem is that retrieving data from a normalized database will involve
    many joins across these many split tables where various pieces of the farm data
    are stored. But for smart farming, the analysis and the analytics should be conducted
    and refreshed continuously and in near-real-time where data supposed to be retrieved
    in the shortest time possible. Thus, denormalizing the tables will significantly
    enhance the data-retrieval by adding redundancy (copying values between tables)
    to the farm''s data lake and reducing the number of joins on the queries. In addition,
    this denormalization will provide aggregation and calculation capabilities to
    the analysis and help extend calculated values for smart farming analytics. It
    is also essential to consider that most DHOs and some of the DMPs come in Excel
    files, stored in a flat raw table. That will limit the flexibility and the scalability
    and is challenging to query on, especially when dealing with big data. Also, the
    visibility of the dimension attributes will be challenging. These requirements
    can be considered as the opposite of the “relational” requirements. Both are defined
    by the so-called “Ralph Kimball Approach” of dimensional modeling. Each dimension
    will include fields for every related row. They will be built separately in dimension
    tables to have fewer rows to query each size, unlike the OBT. Besides, the Ralph-Kimball
    Star-Schema approach provides a flatter design than the Relational approach, where
    the data is separated to its nearly-all granular level to divers’ relationships.
    From a smart farming perspective, the star schema will consider the farming processes
    as fact, e.g., spatial distribution, water management or mechanical system maintenance,
    and dimensions, e.g., geography, time, crop-type, etc. Ordinarily, in this case,
    the star schema will contain these two levels, a simplified design for smart farming
    analytics, as shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (236KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Star Schema for Measurement Trends of the Mechanical
    System. But for spatial distribution, the agriculture season is an important axis
    of analysis that requires more granularity level of the time dimension. At the
    same time, especially for large-farming enterprises, they might have sections
    in different continents, countries, states, and cities. We have to study the climate,
    crop production, productivity, and crop distribution in every district necessitate
    descending into a significantly lower level of granularity of the dimension geography.
    This category of arrangement/configuration is referred to as snowflake schema,
    as described in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 2. Snowflake schema for the spatial distribution.
    The historical data is also an essential factor for the success of the analysis
    and prediction-based analytics. These data allow the farmers to track their processes
    and transactions, equipment, the historical water consumption data to predict
    future consumption. The star schema has few limitations when dealing with these
    historical “big” data because it requires cleansed data highly. The star schema
    doesn''t scale well when upstream systems change. Here where the data vault 2.0
    comes into the picture that shows better performance than 3NF and dimensional
    modeling to create historical data for the smart farming analytics as well as
    master data management. The data vault 2.0 is considered a business intelligence
    system that offers a massively parallel-architecture for big data, unstructured
    data, and real-time processing through data warehousing. The constituent that
    incorporates a data model can deal with multi latency and cross-platform data
    persistence, including disciplined Agile deliveries (based on Agile methodology).
    It is also important to mention that a star schema can be built from a business
    data vault. The data vault has three main types of tables: HUB: Contains a business-key
    list, each one has a surrogate key, along with a metadata describing the source
    system, the origin of the business keys, and the time; 2. LINK: to set up relationships
    between these business keys (ordinarily it describes a relationship of many-to-many),
    these links are essential to deal with granularity changes and lessen the impact
    of appending a new business key to a “linked” HUB; 3. SAT / Satellites: similarly,
    to Ralph-Kimball SCD type II the SAT carries the descriptive attributes and can
    change over time. The LINKs and HUBs form the structure of the data model. The
    SATs include temporary descriptive attributes and the metadata that links them
    to the parent LINK or HUB table. This mechanism gives strong historical capabilities
    by authorizing queries to go back in time, based on the metadata attributes inside
    an SAT table that contains a date where the record becomes valid and another date
    where it is expired. The data vault model consists of the following tables: HUB_SECTION,
    HUB_EQUIPMENT, LNK_SECQUIPMENT, SAT_SECTION, SAT_ADDRESS, and SAT_EQUIPMEN. Fig.

    strategy for smart farming In this section, we propose a smart farming-oriented
    big data Architecture or SFOBA along with the Data Ingestion Strategy that will
    be performed on top of it and the technical component base on their performance.
    Hadoop architecture Thanks to the MapReduce framework of the Hadoop ecosystem,
    the massive farm data can be distributed and replicated across multiple nodes,
    processed in parallel, modeled, and stored. This will guarantee high availability
    and more scalability compared to the traditional decision-making systems. Hadoop
    has three main components: (1) HDFS: which is a Hadoop Distributed File System;
    (2) YARN: which is a distributed operating system; (3). MapReduce: a framework
    for writing and processing data in a Hadoop environment. The main components of
    this architecture are: Resource Manager: For each cluster, a resource manager
    receives and runs the applications—one of its prominent roles in handling resource
    allocation and keeping track of the total resources and nodes. Application Master:
    takes responsibility for managing the execution of the MapReduce jobs (for each
    job, a worker node will act as application master). Job History Server: will provide
    information about the completed jobs. Node Manager: For each data node, there
    is a node manager. This node replaced the Task Tracker in Hadoop 1.x), which manages
    resources and deployment on a node. NameNode: is responsible for making all the
    decisions about block replication. It is responsible for managing the file system
    metadata, monitoring the blocks replication, performing operations (e.g., close,
    open, rename a file) related to the file system namespace, determining the mapping
    between the blocks and DataNodes. And there is a Secondary NameNode that can be
    optional, but it is very important for guaranteeing the High-Availability when
    the NameNode is down. Technical constraints From a Smart-Farming-Analytics perspective,
    the quality of this data cannot be expected, which will significantly impact the
    accuracy of the analytics. Therefore, handling data quality should be one of the
    top priorities when building the data architecture for smart-farming [26], [27],
    [28], [29], [30]. The computation performance in the Hadoop environment has been
    the subject of many works. For example, the result of Rattanaopas et al. [31]
    has compared multiple compression algorithms to improve computation performance
    and increase the storage space while compressing large-small files in a Hadoop
    environment. On a WordCount example, bzip2 outperformed the other algorithms gzip,
    snappy, LZ4 in terms of computation performance and saved the space of the storage
    70% more than a raw HDFS text file (which still shows better computation performance).
    Smart farming oriented big data architecture Hadoop solutions for smart farming
    analytics can be effective alongside a data migration strategy that intercalates
    data-modeling, data processing, data storage, data governance, and data quality,
    as well as the administration/configuration of the Hadoop-System on top of a data
    architecture that meets all these requirements and answers all the technical constraints.
    However, the proposed solutions employed Hadoop technologies in agriculture to
    handle the massive and various farm data and relieve the traditional decision-making
    systems'' limitations. The Hadoop solutions by sticking up couple clusters, grouping
    them, and then installing the needed tools for the analytics might or might not
    be profitable as a solution, especially for the sustainability of the smart farming
    analytics system. Given the fact, a Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture
    (SFOBA) should be designed to guarantee the durability of the system, the employment
    of the data modeling to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics.
    The goal is to provide a strategy for data ingestion that meets the data model
    while processing and storing the farm data, considering the data quality management
    and the system configuration. The proposed architecture should be built in layers
    to guarantee the system''s sustainability. It should handle the variety of sources
    as well as the large workloads considering the Fault-Tolerance. Each data source
    has its particularity regarding data structure and data types that should be handled
    at the Data Model''s level. Smart farming analytics requires processing data in
    batch and real-time. These capabilities should be enabled by the architecture,
    whether on-premise or on a cloud platform. That allows farmers to have more flexibility
    while accessing the data (from Smartphones, Tablets, etc.) using only the Internet
    connection. The solution also requires having a single “source of truth” to all
    the smart farming analytics KPIs, the data lake (built-in layers). With this solution,
    all technical controls and farming business rules verifications can be easily
    executed. It also allows to detect of the anomalies on the data and clean it before
    storing it. The farmers will also be able to be processed by data scientists and
    data visualization tools. In the field of big data, there are three main types
    of architecture from which our SFOBA was inspired: A- Data Lake: is designated
    for processing and storing large volumes of data “mainly” in batch, where raw
    data can be in different formats structured, semi-structured or unstructured.
    This architecture comprises four layers: 1. Data Sources (e.g., Files, Web services,
    Logs, etc.); 2. Ingestion-System: workflow for data ingestion based on Spark,
    Sqoop, Kafka, and other technologies; 3. Data Lake: Which is the Hadoop Data Warehouse
    where the data will be stored; 4. The layer of Interrogation: These will be performed
    based on Hive SQL, Spark SQL, HBase, etc. B- Lambda Architecture: it was aimed
    at handling batch processing within data blocks and real-time processing continually
    depending on the data flow. This architecture is not mainly made for data storage.
    Still, it focuses on joining the massive batch data stored on the Batch Layer
    with the streaming data from the real time / speed layer that will be calculated
    or incremented on dedicated views. Finally, there is a serving layer where the
    client will have direct access to the needed views for the analytics. 3-Kappa
    Architecture: since the Lambda-Architecture is a bit complex because of the merge
    between the batch and streaming layers, the Kappa architecture was designed for
    data processing only without storing the data permanently. This architecture considers:
    (1) data source layer; (2) real time layer where data pipelines will build generally
    using Kafka to store the current messages that will be processed Spark, Storm,
    or other technologies; (3) a layer of views which are the output of the data processing;
    (4) a service layer where data can be queried on using Hive, HBase, Cassandra,
    etc. A recent solution called “delta lake”, an open-source project introduced
    by Databricks that answers many problems cited in the literature. It is a flow
    management mechanism of the data pipeline from data sources to the data lake and
    vice versa, based on the Databricks File System (DBFS) and Apache Spark to provide
    a Transactional-Storage. The main idea is to provide an abstraction layer of the
    data lake that relays on a Spark Optimized Table (SOT) that supports parquet type
    files and manages logs that monitor the table’s changes. The main challenges with
    Delta Lake are: 1. Ensuring the schema enforcement while introducing a new table;
    2. Repairing the newly created tables (mainly hive tables); 3. Refreshing the
    Metadata frequently (to avoid having the data ingested without being able to query
    on it because of the metadata updates); 4. Traffics of small files, especially
    for Distributed Computations; 5. The struggle of sorting the data by index (e.g.,
    an I.D.) where data is partitioned (e.g., by time) and distributed across multiple
    files. This Delta Lake solution provides many advantages, especially for ACID
    transactions. Many jobs can write and modify the target table (or dataset) simultaneously
    and get a consistent view. Also, the reading jobs will not interfere while writing/revising
    the dataset. The Automatic File Management accelerates the data access by grouping
    the data into larger files that can be read effectively. In the solution, we took
    the best of these techniques and adapted them for the Smart-Farming-Analytics.
    To prevent our Data Lake from drowning in the massive farm data. The SFOBA, as
    shown in Fig. 4, which lambda inspires for the fact that the query = function(farming-physical-data-model),
    is built based on five horizontal layers (as described below) where each one has
    its functionalities and performs specific write and read actions upon the previous
    layer. This architecture allows for more agility, flexibility in security maintenance,
    and well management for the data of different formats and historical data [32].
    1. The first layer is a Shared Area: that can also be considered as a landing
    area, which is built on top of a network file system (NFS), containing a structured
    folder based on the farming business logic. This shared area is not a schema but
    a group of folders on NFS that are oriented to save data temporarily. Thus, this
    Shared-Area should have more drivers and more space for storage. In most cases,
    this area will be used as a Gateway of the Hadoop platform, a destination of the
    Manual-Files (mostly DHOs and sometimes DMPs), and a Landing-Area of the data
    coming from less secured sources (mostly DGMs). 2. The second layer is a Raw Zone:
    where the data will land directly from the source into the Hadoop platform. The
    data will be directed on specific directories (based on the physical data model),
    and the Metadata will be assigned to it in hive metastore to be affected by an
    external table. In this area, considering the storage space and the computation
    performance, while importing DMPs mainly from RDBMS using Sqoop jobs, the compression
    algorithms can be employed to write the inputs using bzip2 as recommended. In
    this raw zone, to maintain the security of the user privileges and prevent conflicts
    between the MapReduce jobs that might lock the tables, only the data engineers
    (and the data owner) can access this layer. 3. The third layer is a Structured
    Layer: where the raw data will be stored based on a structure and specific data
    types, unlike the raw zone where all the data will be stored as character data
    type. In this layer, technical controls and farming business rules verifications
    will be launched to check the data quality, detect the anomalies on the data and
    inform the data steward (through emails and dashboards) as described on the activity
    diagram of Fig. 5. Also, the historical data will be stored based on the data
    vault model. Only the data engineers, data stewards (and the data owner) should
    have access to this layer. Download : Download high-res image (194KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Activity Diagram for Data Quality Checks. 4.
    The fourth layer is a Trusted Zone: where the data will be stored based on a data
    model (e.g., Star Schema, Snowflake, or Fact-Constellation) after checking the
    Data Quality and cleaning it on the previous “Structured-Layer.” This zone is
    recommended as the “source of truth” and the centralized Hadoop data warehouse
    of the Smart-Farm, which will be the single source to all Smart Farming-Analytics
    KPIs. 5. The fifth layer is an Enrichment Layer: where the data will be transformed
    and enriched with KPIs calculations for a specific analytics/analysis perspective.
    After the ingestion success on this zone, from a NameNode & memory performance
    management perspective, a job should be launched to delete the related raw zone
    files (to decrease the number of Metadata that have to be handled). The data in
    this layer should be stored in a format readable by data scientists, data analysts
    and suitable for data visualization analysis. Mostly star schemas and snowflakes
    logical data models will be used to store the data in the form of domain-specific
    data marts. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Smart Farming Oriented Big Data Architecture. The SFOBA architecture
    also has two vertical layers: 1. Batch-Layer: where Batch and Micro-Batch data
    will be processed (using technologies like Apache Spark and Python, Apache Kylin),
    stored (on HDFS, Hive, and Impala), and automated in the form of a directed acyclic
    graph workflow (using Oozie or Airflow). 2. Real-Time: where streaming data will
    be consumed (using Kafka or Flume), processed & transformed (using SparkStreaming),
    and then stored directly on the enrichment layer (using HBase) to be joined with
    the batch data, this process will be automated within a data pipeline (using NiFi
    or Streamsets) [33]. Data science for smart farming Data science is a process
    of studying large quantities of disparate data and extracting insights and knowledge
    to aid organizations in making tactics and strategic timely-right decisions. This
    process involves statistical analysis, mathematics, machine-learning, data-visualization,
    etc. Farmers have always been collecting (manually or automatically) a huge amount
    of data for each agriculture season, e.g., applied inputs, harvested crops, planted
    deeds, etc. The growth of new digital technologies (satellites, IoT, remote sensors,
    and drones) has led to the rise of Digital-Farming, which supplies farmers with
    a massive amount of data regarding temperature, nitrogen, soil conditions, etc.
    Data science can help farmers personalize their decisions regarding each farming
    process, using AI tools to speed up analyzing data and bringing back valuable
    insights to farmers. Data science is a generic term that includes the complete
    data processing methodology, where AI encompasses each tool that enables computers
    to learn problem-solving and decision-making. Machine-Learning is a subset of
    AI that makes accurate decisions, uses algorithms to analyze the data, and learns
    from this process without explicitly programming it. Machine Learning models use
    large datasets for training and learn as things progress from these examples,
    but not from a defined-rules (unlike the rules-based algorithms). Thus, they can
    be used for predictive analysis, fraud detection, market basket analysis, recommendations,
    etc. To define a decision rule from which the strategic decisions will be conducted
    [34]. In this research, we have compared machine learning algorithms to find the
    most suitable ones for the smart farming analytics in terms of forecasting and
    predictions. This section determines how we implied machine learning for predicting
    the drought status, crop distribution, and machines breakdown. SFOBA made the
    process of ingesting and transforming the data flexible, easy, and maintainable.
    The first step is the data collected from different sources as defined in Table
    1. The manual source containing the crops-statistics will land on the NFS (let''s
    call it the Edge Node), and a structure check will be done on the Excel-File (using
    Spark or Python). The data will be pushed into the Raw-Zone. For the website data
    sources (accessed via REST API / Web scraping), from a security perspective, it
    is recommended that this data lands first on the Edge Node, and then it will be
    pushed into the Raw-Zone. The RDBMS data (e.g., Oracle database) can be ingested
    directly into the Raw Zone external tables. Table 1. Data Collection from the
    sources. Data Source Domain Data Extraction Tool Technique Governmental Web site

    on the date Oracle Database Drought Status Sqoop Batch loading: a one-time load
    yearly that overwrites the target table Excel File Crop Statistics Spark / Python
    Batch loading: ingesting the whole file In the second step, the data will follow
    the data-ingestion and data-quality process-workflow from the Raw-Zone to the
    Enrichment-Layer, following the defined data models to rich the data mart dedicated
    to the spatial distribution. At this point, we can build our datasets/views dedicated
    to the predictions of drought status and crop distribution. For the soil profile
    classification, it is recommended to use Naïve-Bayes [35]. Either K-means clustering
    using Euclidian-distance or data-binning can be used to label the rainfall, pressure,
    and temperature data since the cluster members are not the same and can be grouped
    obviously. It is a lot easier (in terms of time and performance) to define the
    binning rules that will separate the rows in the data, label the rainfall from
    one to ten, the pressure from one to six, and the temperature from one to ten
    one to five. Otherwise, K-means can be more suitable to sense the length of the
    data since we already know the number of clusters in the data. Given a set of
    points ). We try to partition the points into k sets by minimizing the distance
    between the points to inside each partition. After that, the most important part
    is building the models. For smart-farming analytics, it is recommended not to
    split data randomly into training and test datasets. After building the required
    datasets, it is now time to build the models (the algorithms are described below)
    using technologies like Spark MLlib (it is highly recommended for huge building
    huge data models with massive data) and Python libraries like sklearn. The training
    data containing the three primary parameters Rainfall, Pressure, and Temperature
    to create the model (a first classifier) will build trends and correlations that
    can be used to classify the Drought-Status from low, medium to high and estimate
    the required Rainfall and Pressure. Then a second classifier should be built,
    considering the Season aspect (correlating the data for seasonal parameters).
    This model has as input: (1)- the result of the first classifier; (2)- Crop type
    and soil statistics correlated; (3)- Season data and fertilizers statistics correlated.
    Random Forest (RF) is a nonparametric regression/classification is aimed at retaining
    most of the Decision-Trees'' strengths and get rid of their drawbacks, like their
    vulnerability to over-learning and the complexity of pruning operations. We choose
    the last one from the three main classifiers boosting, bagging, and RF. When it
    comes to boosting, it uses repeated (iterative) retraining. The weights of the
    samples classified incorrectly will be increased as the iterations progress to
    form them more importantly for the successive iterations. Boosting is considered
    a better classifier (more accurate) than bagging, but it is too slow because it
    is noise-sensitive and might fall in overtraining [36], [37], [38], [39], [40].
    On the other hand, the RF classifier can be considered as an advanced version
    of bagging. Fig. 6 shows the results of the confusion matrix obtained from both
    RF classifiers. The algorithm of Random-Forest is founded on three principal ideas,
    which makes it more accurate than other classifiers: 1- From an initial sample
    of N observations where each one is described using p predictive variables, a
    B new samples with the same size of N will be artificially created by the drawing
    with the replacement. This is called the Bootstrap technique, where the B samples
    allow for training B different Decision-Trees. 2- Only a chosen number (at random)
    will be used to perform the associated segmentation with the node of a tree from
    the p Predictive-Variables. 3- While classifying a new observation ×, it will
    be passed through the B trees, and then the majority class among the B predictions
    will be selected. It is based on the fact that the algorithm groups “weak” algorithms
    so that the B decision trees will form a more robust algorithm by voting and by
    proceeding. Download : Download high-res image (75KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. RF Confusion Matrix for Classifier I and II. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser
    3), this algorithm repeatedly divides features into numerous groups (at least
    two) at each step. To build the Decision Tree, the ID3 uses a greedy top-down
    approach, starting from the top to build three, and at every iteration, the best
    feature at the current moment will be selected for node creation. It is based
    on information gain to calculate in the Entropy the reduction to measure how the
    obtained feature classifies (separates) the target classes. The selected attribute
    is the one with the highest information gain. It is important to note that the
    training data can be over-fitted. Thus, it is recommended to use smaller Decision-Trees.
    The ID3 usually constructs small trees (but not usually the smallest possible),
    since in Smart-Farming and especially for the spatial distribution, the data will
    be refreshed mainly based on agriculture-seasons, which fits better the ID3, which
    doesn''t perform better with continuous data [37]. Fig. 7 shows the results of
    the Confusion-Matrix obtained from both ID3 classifiers. Download : Download high-res

    for Classifier I and II. Predictive maintenance in smart farming As we described
    in the previous sections, a timely right preventive action can avert the farm
    from a huge loss, especially when it comes to the equipment break down. In possession
    of the fact table of the mechanical system maintenance, we can look up the measurement
    trends and regroup them into two categories: the ones related to broke-down equipment
    and the ones not, as follows: if EQUIPMENT_ID exist in Order_Intervention, then
    STATUS = broken-down else STATUS = normal. For this perspective, a full join between
    Measurement-Trends and Order_Intervention will be used to create Boolean variable.
    The records that exist on Measurement-Trends and don’t exist in Order_Interventions
    are the ones with the status normal, so this value will be assigned to the Boolean
    variable. Otherwise, it is broken down. This variable will be the target variable
    of the logistic regression model, a linear classification counterpart of the linear
    regression where the target variable “y” takes two values 0 or 1 (Normal or Broken-down).
    As it is a linear model, a score function S of the predictor variables is used
    as follows: (1) For the selection of variables, in the first place, there is the
    Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC was used by proceeding with the backward
    manner, which starts from the model with all the variables, removing at each step
    a single variable until the models indicate that it is better not to remove any
    more variables. The most explicative variable is the one that has the closest
    critical-Probability to zero. As a result, we found that the most explicative
    variables are measurement and category. Also, generally, in the context of a logistic
    model, we do not present the model coefficients but their exponential value. The
    latter corresponds to odds ratios, which differ from the relative risk, but his
    interpretation is similar. An odds ratio of 1 mean no effect. On the other hand,
    an odds ratio much greater than one corresponds to an increase in the phenomenon
    studied. An odds ratio much less than one corresponds to a decrease in the phenomenon
    studied. Decision trees are highly flexible, supervised, non-parametric ML models.
    They can be used both for classification and regression. They use purely algorithmic
    methods which are not based on any probabilistic model. The basic idea is to classify
    an observation using a series of questions (or segmentation criteria) concerning
    the values of the predictor variables xi of this observation. A node in a decision
    tree represents each question. Each outgoing branch of the node corresponds to
    a possible answer to the question asked. Conclusion The future smart agriculture
    will be based on advanced data acquisition combined with several technologies.
    All these outlooks involve data management in a certain way. With the development
    of open-source and big data, different techniques emerged to remedy the limitations
    of traditional decision-making systems. Given the fact, and as we described in
    this research, a Smart-Data-Management can provide a weave of solutions to facilitate
    the farmers'' work when dealing with their daily processes. Therefore, we proposed
    a smart farming-oriented Big Data Architecture (SFOBA) that provides a platform
    to manage farming data in different layers, which executes tasks accordingly,
    allowing for more flexibility and agility. In this paper, we have proposed some
    of the main technical constraints, a Data-Quality process, a way to model the
    farm''s data based on the business logic, a comparison between Machine-Learning
    algorithms where the ID3 gave the highest level of accuracy. In the future, build
    an abstraction layer on top of the SFOBA that automatically handles them based
    on rules defined on the system, without adding them as actions on the directed-acyclic
    graph of the ingestion workflows. The project management aspect, DataOps methodology,
    and the Agile method give an enterprise tincture to the Smart-Farm Data-Management.
    The ultimate goal of our research is to ensure agricultural sustainability and
    environmental protection, secure the energy-consumption, and reach a reasonable
    level of quality, productivity, and high efficiency. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: The global agricultural landscape is undergoing a profound transformation
    driven by technological innovation. This transformation is encapsulated by the
    convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in
    agriculture, creating what is commonly referred to as “Smart Agriculture” or “Precision
    Agriculture”. This paradigm shift from traditional farming practices to data-driven,
    interconnected, and intelligent cultivation methods is revolutionizing how we
    produce food, fiber, and bioenergy. This abstract provides an overview of the
    intricate relationship between AI, IoT, and agriculture, illustrating how these
    technologies are revolutionizing the sector. Smart Agriculture leverages AI algorithms,
    real-time data from IoT sensors, and automation to optimize various aspects of
    farming, including crop monitoring, resource management, and pest control. Through
    real-world case studies and examples, this abstract highlights the tangible benefits
    of Smart Agriculture, such as increased crop yields, resource conservation, and
    enhanced environmental sustainability. While the promise of AI and smart technologies
    in agriculture is immense, this abstract also touches on the challenges and considerations
    associated with their adoption, including data security, privacy concerns, and
    the importance of equitable access to technology. It emphasizes the need for a
    balanced approach that harnesses the transformative potential of AI and IoT while
    safeguarding the interests of farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an era
    of unprecedented population growth, climate change, and resource constraints,
    the integration of AI and smart technologies into agriculture offers a beacon
    of hope. It heralds a future where precision farming not only meets the rising
    demand for agricultural products but also does so sustainably, resiliently, and
    intelligently. As we embark on this technological journey, it is essential to
    recognize the transformative power of AI and IoT in shaping the future of agriculture
    and to chart a course that ensures a smarter, greener, and more abundant agricultural
    environment for generations to come.

    Through real-world case studies and examples, this abstract highlights the tangible
    benefits of Smart Agriculture, such as increased crop yields, resource conservation,
    and enhanced environmental sustainability. While the promise of AI and smart technologies
    in agriculture is immense, this abstract also touches on the challenges and considerations
    associated with their adoption, including data security, privacy concerns, and
    the importance of equitable access to technology. It emphasizes the need for a
    balanced approach that harnesses the transformative potential of AI and IoT while
    safeguarding the interests of farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an era
    of unprecedented population growth, climate change, and resource constraints,
    the integration of AI and smart technologies into agriculture offers a beacon
    of hope. It heralds a future where precision farming not only meets the rising
    demand for agricultural products but also does so sustainably, resiliently, and
    intelligently. As we embark on this technological journey, it is essential to
    recognize the transformative power of AI and IoT in shaping the future of agriculture
    and to chart a course that ensures a smarter, greener, and more abundant agricultural
    environment for generations to come. Keywords AI IoT Precision agriculture Access

    and Opportunities with Recent Advancements Chapter © 2021 Impact of Internet of
    Things in Agriculture Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Agriculture has long been
    the cornerstone of human civilization, providing sustenance, livelihoods, and
    economic prosperity to communities around the world. However, the global agricultural
    landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting both unprecedented challenges and exciting
    opportunities. As the world''s population continues to surge towards an estimated
    9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for food, fiber, and bioenergy is intensifying
    [1, 2]. This surge in demand, coupled with the increasingly volatile climate and
    resource constraints, necessitates a profound transformation in how we practice
    agriculture. The answer to this challenge lies in the convergence of cutting-edge
    technologies, notably Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), which collectively form the bedrock of what is now known as “Smart Agriculture”
    or “Precision Agriculture” [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Smart Agriculture represents a paradigm
    shift from traditional farming methods to a data-driven, interconnected, and intelligent
    approach to cultivation. It harnesses the power of AI, data analytics, automation,
    and IoT to optimize agricultural processes, conserve resources, enhance crop yields,
    and mitigate environmental impacts [8,9,10,11,12]. This chapter embarks on a journey
    into the realm of AI and smart technologies within the context of agriculture.
    It explores how these technologies are reshaping the agricultural landscape, from
    the vast fields of staple crops to the intricate networks of urban vertical farms.
    It examines the key applications of AI and smart technologies in precision farming,
    highlights real-world case studies of their implementation, and considers the
    implications for farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an age where information
    is a critical resource, the fusion of AI and agriculture represents a pivotal
    moment in human history. It offers the promise of feeding a burgeoning global
    population sustainably, reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture, and
    enhancing the resilience of food systems in the face of climate change. Yet, it
    also raises questions about data security, privacy, and equitable access to these
    transformative technologies. As we embark on this exploration of AI and smart
    technologies in agriculture, we must recognize that we are at the cusp of a new
    agricultural revolution. The seeds of innovation have been sown, and it is our
    responsibility to nurture this burgeoning field to ensure a greener, more abundant,
    and more technologically advanced future of agriculture [13,14,15]. “Precision
    agriculture is an approach to farm management that uses information technology
    (IT) to ensure that crop and soil receive exactly wat they need for optimum health
    and productivity. The goal of PA is to ensure profitability, sustainability and
    protection of the environment” (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Agriculture system Full size image
    “PA is also known as satellite agriculture as needed farming and site-specific
    crop management (SSCM). Modern farming has involved since the day of horse/bullock
    drawn plough. According to Taro Mieno, Assistant Professor, Department of agriculture
    and economics, university of Nebraska. Lincoln, dedicated research worker showed
    the impact of adopting precision technology on farms. Mieno’s research focuses
    specifically on how precision agriculture technologies impact profitability for
    farmers. PA recognizes the diversity of characteristics within a field through
    technology. Some examples of precision agriculture include drones, Global Positioning
    system (GPS) and irrigation technologies [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. The goal of
    precision agriculture is to learn new management practices to increase the profitability
    of agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low-cost technologies,
    so that the farmers of developing countries may also be benefited by high level
    technologies. 2 Types of Precision Agriculture Precision AG’s editor Eric sfiligoy
    has prepared a list of the top 10 technologies that are shaping precision precision
    agriculture today. Most involve some level of robotics, navigation, sensors and
    variable rate dispensing (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Precision agricultural cycle Full size
    image 1. GPS/GNSS: Its hard to tell exactly where the state of precision agriculture
    today would be without GPS-literally. From virtually movement agriculture gained
    access to position locating satellites in the 1990’s, operators and manufactures
    have found out various ways to the tie into the tools to make managing field work
    much easier and accurate. In North America and Europe, grower can turn on the
    tractors and get to work almost immediately, says T.J.Schulte, marketing manager
    for trimble agriculture Division. Looking beyond these caopabilities, experts
    say that satellite technology is truly deserving of its “global” monitor. “No
    longer can we refer to all these system as GPS-that is not an accurate description
    when referring to new global Navigation Satellite system (GNSS) receiver technology
    today”. Instead, Grey Guyette adds GNSS covers all countries satellite con stellations
    including GPS, GLONASS and Galileo [21,22,23] (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 GPS Full size image
    2. Mobile Devices: After figuring out where PA stands on the planets, the next
    most important innovation these past 20 year would have to be the development
    of mobile devices. “Without the cell phone, we probably would still be sitting
    in barn a lot, waiting for someone to come to the barn and make things work”,
    Says Reifsteck. Today, cell phone has morphed into a whole host of useful mobile
    devices including smatphone and tablets. As of 2016, most precision agriculture
    manufactures that dabble in the mobile devices market have spent most of their
    time trying to expand the capabilities these products can offer to users. According
    to Dr. M. Barnes “if you cannot get your technical data to work for the farmers
    within first 20 min after he receives it, he is probably never going to use it”.
    Robotics: Robots are taking on making many tasks in agriculture these days, including
    planting greenhouse crops and pruning vineyards. In a different approach, the
    Fendt MARS (Mobile Agriculture Robot Swarms) project utilizers small corn seeding
    robots that are lightweight, energy efficient, highly agile, cloud controlled
    and operated from tablet app [24,25,26,27]. Irrigation: Innovations in precision
    agriculture technologies are growing even more crucial as growers face water scarcity
    due t drought, aquifer depletion and water allocations. Adoption with valley irrigation,
    products now allow growers to remotely monitor, and control nearly facet of their
    irrigation operations. The system save water. Timely, fuel and wear and tear on
    the vehicles. In the future, Compbell says producers will be integrating soil
    moisture monitoring, weather data and variable- rate irrigation (VRI) inti their
    system. Internet of Things: One of the newest buzzwords to hit precision over
    the past few of years is the “Internet of things” (IOT). Simply defined, it’s
    the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet. This
    network of connected things could also include people with wearable devices. Most
    recently, a few ag startups and components suppliers (hardware, software etc.)
    are using LPWANs (Low Power wide Area Network) in place of or to augment cellular
    networks in wireless data transmission. These networks are designed to carry small
    amounts of data transmitted intermittently over long ranges” says Paul Welbig
    [28]. Sensors: In precision agriculture, wireless sensors are used to collect
    data on a variety of factors, including soil water availability, soil compaction,
    soil fertility, leaf temperature, leaf area index, plant water status, local climatic
    data, insect-disease-weed infestation, and more. The management of water uses
    some of the most cutting-edge and varied technology now available. The growing
    control of water consumption across the country, as well as the shortage of water,
    will continue to be the driving force for advancements in this field [29]. Variable
    Rate seeding: It might come as a surprise to learn that variable-rate application
    (VRA) seeding is included on this list, considering all of the new and interesting
    technology for precision agriculture that are included. There is not much of a
    difference between it and variable rate fertiliser, because VRA sowing depends
    on your capacity to put together precise data for the seed itself, which is the
    beginning of the agricultural process [30,31,32] (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Weather modelling
    Full size image When you go into the majority of the country''s agricultural retail
    establishments, there is a good possibility that you will find some form of weather
    tracker on display. There is perhaps no other variable that is both as significant
    and as unpredictably vital as the weather. However, assistance is on its way.
    “Over the past 25 years, you’ve gotten a lot of important technologies developed
    that would be even more valuable with quality weather modelling, but we are now
    at a point where assuring good crop yields is key to making certain the world
    has food solutions that works”, says Jeff Kaiser, Vice President, Iteris. As an
    illustration of this, consider the case of a potato planter in the Northern Plains
    who discovered that harvesting his crop at a particular temperature was essential
    to preserving the crop''s quality and consistency. “But by using clear Ag, this
    grower was able to take all their soil reading remotely and he was able to accomplish
    his harvest a lot more efficiently than even before” [33,34,35,36]. Nitrogen Modelling:
    The fertilizer have been used in forms of variable rate for decades, nitrogen
    modelling has become pronounced recently. “Our clientele has been using variable
    rate technologies for fertilizer applications Since the mid 1990s”, says Matt
    waits, CEO for SST software. “However, the complexity of the N-cycle and how it
    is in a constant state of fux has always made managing nitrogen difficult”. A
    recent partnership between SST software and agronomic technology Corp (ATC) resulted
    in the introduction of Adopt-N. Adopt-N was initially presented to the public
    in 2014, and according to Steve Sibulkin, Chief Executive Officer of ATC, it is
    rapidly becoming into an essential instrument for effectively regulating the utilization
    of nitrogen. The overwhelming majority of farmers desire an easy-to-implement
    solution that will allow them to handle these issues (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Controlled
    release micronutrient fertilizer for precision farming Full size image Standardization:
    Initial efforts to implement this began almost eight years ago with the founding
    of the agriculture industry electronic foundation. Equipment manufacturers’ components,
    mainly those that adhere to the ISOBUS standard, continue to make their way into
    official circulation. More than 170 businesses, associations, and other types
    of organisations are currently part of the group and are actively working together
    to ensure that the standards are effective. However, industry players who have
    to deal with equipment compatibility “ On the ground” continue to be unhappy,
    and third party tech specialists frequently have difficulty managing items from
    rival providers. It is a lot better than it was, but it is still a significant
    problem. There will come a day, ideally, when components will get to the point
    where they are pretty much plug-and-play. It’s interesting to know that Precision
    Agriculture sure drive system today have wireless sensors together data on soil
    availability, Compaction, infertility and other data [37,38,39]. 3 Precision Agriculture’s
    Role in the New Era of the Farm Land Sector. The new generation of Agriculture
    systems addresses climate change adaptation alongside investor’s usual goals of
    improving yield and reducing costs. Precision farming refers to the precise application
    of agricultural inputs with respect to soil, weather as well as to crop need in
    order to improve productivity, quality and profitability in agriculture. Hence,
    precision agriculture is about going the right thing, in the right place, in the
    right way at the right [40]. 3.1 Advantages of Precision Farming It did this by
    increasing agricultural productivity and halting soil deterioration on areas suitable
    for cultivation, which led to further agricultural advancement. It will result
    in a reduction in the excessive use of chemicals in agricultural production. Precision
    farming allows for more effective use of available water resources. Agricultural
    fields may be surveyed more easily with the use of GPS. Additionally, the yield
    as well as the features of the soil may be plotted. The dissemination of knowledge
    on agricultural methods, with the goals of improving crop quality and quantity
    while simultaneously lowering production costs. Through the optimization of agrochemical
    products, it lessens the threat to the environment, in particular with regard
    to the leaching of nitrates and the poisoning of groundwater. It enhances the
    possibilities for better resource management, which in turn helps to decrease
    the number of resources that are wasted. An undulated field may be subdivided
    into smaller plots according to the specific needs of the individual customers.
    3.2 Disadvantages of Precision Farming Farmers may be dissuaded from adopting
    this style of farming due to the high initial investment required. Techniques
    for precision farming are still in the process of being developed and require
    the advise of specialists before they can be put into practise. It is possible
    that it will take several years before sufficient data is collected to really
    deploy the system in its entirety. It is a very challenging endeavor, particularly
    the gathering of data and the interpretation of the results. 3.3 How Could India
    Benefit from Precision Farming? A decrease in the cost of production, an increase
    in productivity, and a more efficient use of natural resources may all be achieved
    in India through the development, refinement, and wider deployment of precision
    agricultural technology. It has the potential to completely transform the way
    farms are managed in modern India. As a result of improvements in profitability,
    productivity, sustainability, crop quality, environmental protection, on-farm
    quality of life, food safety, and rural economic growth. Application of site-specific
    irrigation in wheat grown in Punjab and Haryana, use of site-specific herbicides
    in cotton, and application of site-specific fertilizers in oil palm plantation
    in south India, as well as coffee and tea gardens in eastern India. India is able
    to significantly lower manufacturing costs, as well as lower production expenses,
    and lower the amount of chemicals that are loaded into the environment [41]. When
    there are limited amounts of water available, it can improve the efficiency of
    the irrigation system. In addition to this, it offers new instruments for the
    evaluation of multifunctional features, such as those that do not involve the
    market, and it expands job chances for those with specialized training in the
    agriculture industry. The farmer may utilize the prediction to prevent issues
    like as water stress, nutritional inadequacy, and pest and disease infestation.
    The state of greenhouses in agricultural areas may be monitored by it, which is
    an important function it plays. 4 Challenges in Adopting Precision Farming in
    India 1. The implementation of PA in India is still in the preliminary stages
    as a result of the country''s distinctive pattern of land ownership, its inadequate
    infrastructure, the reluctance of farmers to take risks, as well as the country''s
    social, economic, and demographic circumstances. 2. The majority of Indian agriculture
    is conducted on very tiny plots of land, which restricts the economic improvements
    that may be made with the precision farming equipment that is now available. 4.1
    The War Forward New windows of opportunity for the implementation of precision
    farming are opening up in India as a result of the rapid socioeconomic shifts
    that include economic growth, urbanization, and increased energy consumption.
    Instead of blindly adopting the advanced precision agriculture technologies adopted
    by developed countries, India should adopt technologies based on the need of socio-economic
    condition of the country (IAS express-2022). 5 How Precision Agriculture in India
    is Adopted According to Rashika Solomon (2020), the agriculture is backbone of
    India’s economy, which accounts for 18% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP)
    and hires about half of the countries workforce. More than 70% of rural families
    depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The implementation of forward-thinking
    agricultural practises such as precision agriculture is a viable option for accomplishing
    this objective. The PA is an integrated crop management system that monitors the
    agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing (RS), global positioning
    system (GPS), and geographical information system (GIS). Recording and mapping
    the variations in crop and soil parameters that are present within a field is
    done. Following this, management decisions are made based on the findings of ongoing
    assessments of the spatial variability within the given field. In India, it is
    referred to as the efficient use of agricultural inputs in order to achieve higher
    levels of crop output (Gunnamreddy, 2022). 6 Conclusion Technologies that enable
    precision agriculture are playing an increasingly important part in the production
    of food crops. PA, For example, a guiding system for tractors that uses GPS. The
    use of global positioning system (GPS) technology for mapping soil and yield as
    well as variable-rate input applications helps farmers collect information on
    the changing field condition so that production techniques may be adjusted. Soil
    mapping, a similar precision technique, provides farmers with additional data
    that they can really use. When creating soil maps, more soil samples are collected,
    and zones are used to depict the different soil types, nitrate levels, and pH
    acidity readings. GPS is used by farmers to plot yield maps and data on maps in
    synchronisation with one another. Nevertheless, soil maps have a lot of practical
    applications since they display properties of the ground that are likely to be
    consistent from year to year. Finally, variable rate input application technology
    (VRT) enables farmers to tailor the application of fertiliser, chemicals, and
    pesticides by making use of GPS data, which is often derived from yield and soil
    maps. The adoption of PA in India depends on the pressure of population which
    is growing rapidly and more than 65% are directly employed by agricultural system.
    Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to modernize conventional agricultural
    techniques and be ready for an impending technological revolution in order to
    build an environmentally friendly system for increasing crop yield. The implementation
    of forward-thinking agricultural practices such as precision agriculture is a
    viable option for accomplishing this objective. PA is an integrated crop management
    system that monitors the agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing
    (RS), global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS).
    Recording and mapping the differences in crop or soil qualities that are present
    within a field is done. In India, it is known as the exact exploitation of agricultural
    inputs to discover improved crop output by utilizing precision agriculture. This
    is done in an effort to improve food security. References Anonymous: What is precision

  description: This position paper aims to trigger a technical discussion by proposing
    a conceptual architecture for big data streaming integrated with complex event
    processing (BiDCEP). BiDCEP expands the Lambda and Kappa (LK) architectures for
    big data streaming to fit the complex event processing (CEP) and event management
    domains of enterprise IT. BiDCEP links CEP components as defined in previous work
    of Events Collections, Purifications and Enrichments with the big data LK batch
    and speed layers, and wraps the LK service layer with integration interfaces for
    expandable grid of interlinked BiDCEP units. The BiDCEP architecture can enable
    the LK big data quality attributes of scale, availability and latency to be maintained,
    while accounting for CEP enterprise IT requirements of load and content shedding,
    basic and derived enrichment, semantics transformation, and security enforcement.
    As such, open source big data streaming strengths can be employed within the context
    of an enterprisegrade IT with monitored service levels.

  description: 'The commercialization of precision agriculture technologies has led
    to resurgence in field-scale on-farm experimentation by farmers and researchers.
    Although the cost of implementing experiments and collecting data has decreased
    due to innovative use of geospatial technologies, barriers to making the best
    farm management decisions based on field experiments remain. The most recent statistics
    of farmers'' adoption and use of yield monitors are reported. Based on theory
    and experiences from a four-year case study of farmers using yield monitor data,
    this study reports how the most successful farmers and researchers make use of
    precision agriculture in their decision-making process. Topics include designing
    and implementing appropriate field-scale experiments conducive to the landscape
    and chosen treatments, collecting and managing data, qualities desired by farmers
    in a reputable spatial data analyst, and using on-farm trial results in the farm
    management decision-making process. Yield monitor data quality impacts the farm
    management decision. Typical yield monitor data analysis may use data subjected
    to a default correction process of farm level software. Recent advances to farm
    level software include the integration of professional data filtering capabilities.
    Results from both traditional aspatial and spatial analyses of differing levels
    of yield data quality are discussed including: 1) accepting default settings from
    a range of popular standard farm software packages and 2) a conscious removal
    of erroneous points and flow delay adjustments. The decisions that the rational
    farm manager would make for each of these scenarios are presented, addressing
    the question of the economic importance of quality yield data.'

  description: The integration of agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain
    has become the key technology of precision agriculture. How to protect data privacy
    and security from data source is one of the difficult issues in agricultural IoT
    research. This work integrates cryptography, blockchain and Interplanetary File
    System(IPFS) technologies, and proposes a general IoT blockchain terminal system
    architecture, which strongly supports the integration of the IoT and blockchain
    technology. This research innovatively designed a fine-grained and flexible terminal
    data access control scheme based on the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption(CP-ABE)
    algorithm. Based on CP-ABE and DES algorithms, a hybrid data encryption scheme
    is designed to realize 1-to-N encrypted data sharing. A "horizontal + vertical"
    IoT data segmentation scheme under blockchain technology is proposed to realize
    the classified release of different types of data on the blockchain. The experimental
    results show that the design scheme can ensure data access control security, privacy
    data confidentiality, and data high-availability security. This solution significantly
    reduces the complexity of key management, can realize efficient sharing of encrypted
    data, flexibly set access control strategies, and has the ability to store large
    data files in the agricultural IoT.

  explanation: 'This paper constructs a thermal energy storage dispatch model for
    buildings that are intelligent and uses Phase Change Material. It also creates
    a five-dimensional model using Digital Twins Technology. The model is created
    using data from a real-time, intelligent building from its physical entity. The
    Digital Twin model is made up of five parts: the Physical Entity (PE), Virtual
    Entity (VE), Service System (SS), DTD, and CN. This model is used to investigate
    the heat loss and storage characteristics of the materials used in the PCW structures,
    which is the basis of the thermal energy storage system. It also establishes a
    thermal network model of the PCW structure and the building. The heat loss and
    storage characteristics of the materials are investigated using this model. The
    heat loss is calculated using equations that represent the heat conduction and
    heat radiation coefficients of the PCM and the outer and inner walls. The heat
    transfer of the forced air circulation is calculated as the enthalpy change difference

    Material in the indoor building structure. • The DTs model of the Phase Change
    Wall (PCW) structure is constructed. • The PCW structure is used to build a thermal
    energy storage. Abstract The purpose of this work is to explore the role of the
    safe and optimal scheduling of thermal energy storage systems in intelligent buildings
    in promoting sustainable economic development under Digital Twins (DTs) technology.
    Phase Change Material (PCM) has high energy density, constant temperature storage,
    small footprint, and long service life. Here, PCM is first placed in the indoor
    building structure, and the DTs technology is introduced. In the development of
    intelligent buildings, the data generated by the energy storage system of intelligent
    buildings in the real space can be mapped to the virtual space in real time for
    simultaneous analysis. In addition, the PCM wall structure and thermal network
    DTs model are designed for the intelligent building. In addition, the PCW structure
    is used to build a thermal energy storage and dispatch model of the smart thermoelectric
    building based on DTs. Finally, the model is evaluated and analyzed experimentally.
    The analysis of system optimization power under different schemes indicates that
    the scheduling operation strategy of thermal energy storage of building walls
    can avoid overcharging or over-discharging batteries in the microgrid and reduce
    battery power consumption. Besides, the building wall energy storage capacity
    is always in the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on the all-weather scale. Moreover, the model
    constructed here achieves significantly lower economic costs, environmental costs,
    and energy costs and a better energy-saving effect than the existing model. The
    model built here can serve as experimental reference for further digital energy
    storage in intelligent buildings and comprehensive energy utilization because
    of its superior safety performance and lower consumption. Previous article in

    change materialIntelligent buildingMicrogrid 1. Introduction With the rapid development
    of information technology, various advanced are even more broadly applied, such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Digital Twins (DTs), and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI). For example, Cheng et al. (2022) proposed an energy-efficient
    multilayer virtual traffic scheduling algorithm regarding smart city construction
    that can effectively provide directions for smart city development and construction
    [1]. These techniques have also promoted the transformation of the construction
    industry from traditional construction and management methods to digital and intelligent
    transformation, which is one of the pillar industries of China''s real economy
    [2]. The building provides housing and keeps the cold out. Therefore, the design
    of the wall''s heat preservation performance is extremely essential. The heat
    insulation and thermal energy storage function of the building makes the whole
    indoor environment warm in winter and cool in summer, reflecting the energy saving,
    improving the living environment, and functions of using the construction [3].
    Therefore, the application of IoT, Cloud Computing, AI, and other technologies
    to building insulation and thermal energy storage security has become the focus
    of scholars in related fields. Currently, the building industry is in the process
    of intelligent development. Its overall design usually adopts the integrated design-manufacturing-construction
    method for bidding to ensure the integrity and integration of the overall building
    [4]. In the traditional building construction process, high requirements are put
    forward for information sharing, interaction, and collaboration among the design
    unit, manufacturer, and construction unit. However, there are still cases of conflicting
    nodes of building components in the construction process of actual engineering
    projects, such as nodes of columns and beams or nodes of wall panels and concealed
    columns. The problem of heat insulation and thermal energy storage during the
    construction of buildings is prominently important [5]. Jiang et al. (2021) formulated
    and fabricated a new self-reinforced composite phase change material for thermal
    energy storage using continuous hot-melt extrusion. They aimed to address the
    mismatch between energy production and demand under deep renewable energy penetration
    scenarios and address climate change challenges [6]. Wang et al. (2022) designed
    and constructed a novel medium to high temperature packed-bed latent heat storage
    material for thermal energy storage studies in buildings [7]. After understanding
    the performance of thermal energy storage materials designed in the above-mentioned
    traditional building construction, AI technology is introduced to analyze the
    digital construction of intelligent buildings. The construction of buildings develops
    intellectually with the application of various technologies, such as IoT, Cloud
    Computing, DTs, and AI. Spiking neural networks in machine learning are thought
    to boost the precision and durability of spike-based meta-learning by Yang & Tan
    et al. (2022) [8] and Yang & Linares-Barranco (2022) [9]. The self-adaptive multicompartment
    algorithm has been presented by Yang and Gao et al. (2022) as a means to create
    efficient adaptive neuromorphic computing systems for use in domains ranging from
    robotics to edge computing [10]. For example, the high-efficiency collaboration
    of the integration of project design, construction production, and operation and
    maintenance services of building insulation and thermal energy storage engineering
    driven by digital chain can be realized through digital modeling, visual cognition
    and interaction, high performance computing of relevant data, and intelligent
    decision making [11], [12]. DTs technology can simulate and describe the state
    and behavior of entities in physical space through high-fidelity dynamic virtual
    models and preview or simulate all activities of physical entities in virtual
    space in advance or in real-time [13]. For instance, Lv et al. (2022) combined
    DTs and AI to predict traffic accidents. The result showed that the prediction
    accuracy is high, which can provide a reference for the prevention of traffic
    congestion [14]. Introducing DTs technology into the construction process of intelligent
    building insulation and thermal energy storage systems can effectively improve
    the efficiency of construction projects and reduces the incidence of errors, and
    improve construction quality. It also improves the informatization and intelligence
    of the construction process of building insulation and thermal energy storage
    projects, promoting the digital development of thermal insulation and thermal
    energy storage systems in smart buildings. Of course, the operation of thermal
    insulation and thermal energy storage systems in smart buildings is inseparable
    from the support of the power system. Microgrids utilize decentralized local energy
    sources for distributed generation and apply them to the distributed thermal energy
    storage systems in buildings [15]. Swaminathan et al. (2020) developed an optimal
    sizing and scheduling model for microgrids with model predictive control. They
    found that building-level microgrids for medium-sized commercial buildings can
    save initial and operational costs [16]. Ramli & Jabbar (2022) proposed a solar-powered
    portable water pump for IoT-enabled smart irrigation system. Tests of the developed
    solar water pump confirmed its effectiveness. It has successfully conserved energy
    and cut down on running expenses [17]. The heat pump is connected to the microgrid
    when the building is constructed. The thermal energy storage system and heat pump
    can flexibly adjust the power according to the real-time electricity price and
    renewable energy generation under the premise of ensuring the appropriate indoor
    temperature of the building [18]. If the electricity meets the customer''s electricity
    demand, the surplus electricity will be converted into heat energy by the heat
    pump and stored in the intelligent building heat storage system. Suppose the local
    decentralized energy generation is insufficient. In that case, the intelligent
    building thermal storage system can release thermal energy into the microgrid,
    and users only need a small amount of purchased electricity to meet their power
    needs. In summary, exploring the safe dispatch and sustainable development of
    thermal energy storage systems in intelligent buildings is of theoretical significance
    to the green development of the social economy and the improvement of social and
    economic benefits. Therefore, this work innovatively introduces DTs technology
    into intelligent buildings and places the Phase Change Material (PCM) in the interior
    building structure. Additionally, a DTs-based thermal energy storage and safety
    scheduling model for thermoelectric smart buildings is constructed using the PCM
    wall. Measurements of its effectiveness obtained through experimentation. This
    work provides experimental support for the rational modernization of the construction
    industry and contributes to the long-term health of the economy. The structure
    of this work is as follows. Section 1 introduces the research background, motivation,
    purpose, innovation, and contribution. Section 2 expounds on the research of scholars
    in related fields and analyzes its advantages and disadvantages, which makes the
    value of this research prominent. Section 3 introduces the DTs technology and
    designs the PCW structure of the intelligent building. On this basis, a DTs-based
    thermal energy storage and scheduling model is constructed for thermoelectric
    smart buildings. Finally, the model performance is experimentally evaluated. Section
    4 comparatively compares the model constructed here with different schemes proposed
    by scholars in related fields. Section 5 briefly outlines the research results
    and explains the limitations and prospects. 2. Related work 2.1. Analysis of the
    application status of DTs in the field of construction DTs technology is the digital
    representation of a physical process, person, place, system, or device. It can
    promote the intelligent building to realize the information fusion and interaction
    between virtual space and physical space. Many scholars have conducted research
    on the application of DTs in architecture. Li et al. (2020) proposed a DTs-driven
    sustainability evaluation information architecture for the dynamic evolution of
    the entire life cycle in intelligent manufacturing, aimed at the challenges faced
    by the conventional manufacturing industry. Finally, they verified the effectiveness
    of the DTs dynamic information architecture and sustainability evaluation method
    [19]. White et al. (2021) found that the combination of increasingly large and
    accurate Building Information Models (BIMs) in smart cities and big data generated
    by IoT sensors makes a large amount of data in smart cities even more accurate
    and transparent. Meanwhile, a public and open DTs model makes the planning of
    the smart city industrialization process increasingly accurate [20]. Chen et al.
    (2021) proposed an embodied carbon estimation method in buildings based on DTs
    technology and life cycle assessment. They applied the model to automatic data
    communication between BIM databases. The comparative analysis result suggested
    that this embodied carbon estimation method outperformed others [21]. 2.2. Analysis
    on the current situation of research on optimal scheduling of Cooling, Heating,
    and power in intelligent buildings When modeling smart buildings, many scholars
    have studied the performance related to the optimal operation and dispatch of
    combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) microgrids and energy storage systems
    of a smart building. Cybersecurity concerns with running Virtual Power Plants
    and microgrids powered by renewable energy sources were highlighted in a study
    by Ravi et al. (2022). Security and operational scenarios for the new ecosystem
    are also outlined [22], with an emphasis on the interoperability, security, and
    integration of Distributed Energy Resources. Antoniadou-Plytaria et al. (2020)
    proposed an energy management system model for smart building microgrids based
    on battery energy storage. They proved that the framework could accurately estimate
    building operating costs and improve the overall performance of batteries as flexible
    resources in building microgrids through simulation [23]. Cui et al. (2020) constructed
    a nonlinear partial load ratio model for gas turbines, boilers, and coolers and
    proposed a piecewise least squares linearization method. The results showed that
    the optimal operation effect of optimal scheduling for different objectives is
    significantly better than the constant efficiency model. Besides, the choice of
    gas turbine, heat recovery steam generator, and electric chiller models for both
    models greatly impact the system operation results [24]. Ren et al. (2021) evaluated
    two different systems using solar energy. In system A, solar energy was converted
    into heat and electricity by solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic (PV) panels,
    respectively. Solar energy was converted into heat and electricity through PV
    thermal collectors in system B. It was found that when system A operates under
    the following electric load strategy, it can bring many benefits to the three
    buildings and construct a system with a configuration and component size that
    are closely related to the building type [25]. Dong et al. (2022) presented an
    optimization strategy based on robust model predictive control to deal with multiple
    uncertainties in source loads. Under uncertain scenarios of renewable energy generation
    and load consumption, the optimization model was transformed into a tractable
    form for robust dispatch that minimizes operating costs. The authors confirmed
    that under uncertain scenarios, the optimal dispatching model of their intelligent
    building CCHP system reduces the operating cost by 11.5% compared with the traditional
    model predictive control strategy [26]. Lin et al. (2022) proposed a new thermoelectric
    powered wireless sensor network platform for low-cost environmental sensing in
    building envelopes through thermoelectric energy harvesting and ultra-low power
    management. The result suggested that the system can offer unique and innovative
    advantages in terms of self-powered system architecture, thermally optimized internals,
    and milliwatt power management [27]. 2.3. Summarization Based on an analysis of
    the relevant research conducted by the aforementioned experts, it has been determined
    that the digital twin technology was initially applied to intelligent buildings.
    The research on the modeling of the medium thermal energy storage system is overly
    simplistic, and the thermal network''s construction is not refined. In practical
    operation, the thermal side of the structure may pose a safety risk if it is out
    of control. In order to improve the building''s intelligence and the stability
    and safety of its thermal system, this study implements digital twin technology
    so that the data generated by the smart building''s energy storage system in the
    real world can be mapped to the virtual space in real time and analyzed in synchrony.
    More research is needed to develop and test the fine thermal network DTs model
    of phase-change thermal storage wall structure and thermal energy storage in intelligent
    buildings. This model is useful for building smart buildings and keeping the economy
    growing in a sustainable way. 3. DTs-based thermal energy storage system for smart
    buildings and its scheduling strategy security 3.1. Application of DTs technology
    in intelligent buildings The first task is to create a DTs model of the construction
    application to integrate the DTs technology with the practical construction field.
    This work expands the 3D model, adds two dimensions of DTs Data (DTD) and Connection
    (CN), and constructs a five-dimensional DTs model [28], as shown in Fig. 1. Download

    Energy conversion diagram for Scheme 1. The model developed during this study
    is referred to as scheme 1. It transfers the heat energy from the building''s
    walls into electrical energy for power generation using a generator. The spinning
    reserve capacity of the wind/solar/storage grids is provided by the battery system''s
    comprehensive utilization. Fig. 1 displays the energy conversion diagram for Scheme
    1. The five-dimensional DTs model in Fig. 1 mainly includes five parts: the Physical
    Entity (PE), Virtual Entity (VE), Service System (SS), DTD, and CN between each
    part. The five elements complement each other and form the DTs of the intelligent
    building [29]. Ma et al. (2022) designed a DTs-driven operational mechanism and
    a general framework for big data cleaning and integration to explain and illustrate
    sustainable smart manufacturing in smart buildings [30]. In the intelligent building
    DTs, the PE is a physical product that the user can operate. In addition to completing
    the normal function output, it is necessary to collect the parameters required
    by the environment and the building''s own operating system to drive the VE model
    of the information domain.; VE is the mapping of the PE and the basis for building
    a five-dimensional DTs model. It can characterize and describe the PE of intelligent
    buildings from multiple dimensions, multiple spatial scales, and multiple time
    scales. SS is a newly added dimension and is the main driver of the DTs model.
    It relies on the virtual space algorithm library, model library, database, and
    expert knowledge base to make decisions on the operation scenario and status of
    the intelligent building energy storage system to realize the scheduling of thermal
    network clusters [31]. DTD is the data that exists and operates according to the
    rules defined by the system in the DTs model. It mainly studies and analyzes the
    operation and data flow processing of the DTs system of intelligent buildings.
    CN can complete the interconnection and intercommunication between the various
    components. PE, VE, and SS are regarded as structural points. The topology of
    the DTs model of the intelligent building can be formed through the connection
    between the structural issues. Fig. 2 reveals the DTs model of an intelligent
    building based on the five-dimensional DTs system. Download : Download high-res

    equipment such as wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, and battery energy storage
    systems and only uses the battery energy storage system as a spinning backup.
    Fig. 2 shows the energy conversion diagram for Scheme 2. Fig. 2 depicts the evolution
    of the DTs intelligent building model. First, identify the physical entity, i.e.,
    the component of the intelligent building, and provide the pertinent physical
    entity specification. Second, develop a virtual entity, abstract the spatial structure
    of the intelligent building, and evaluate simulations using the relevant model.
    Third, design data; determine the data that must be collected when the smart building
    is in operation, as well as the equipment required for data collection. Fourth,
    establish a connection; clarify the connection between the physical entity and
    the virtual entity of the smart building, as well as the connection protocol used.
    Fifth, test the smart building. Sixth, validate the smart building. Fifth, realize
    the service aimed at the intelligent building''s practical issues, enhance the
    traditional scheduling process, and develop a platform to present the intelligent
    building''s DTs data. The user tests and evaluates the developed intelligent building
    model, makes specific improvement suggestions, and enriches and refines software
    requirements, such as adding vision and physical entity models, making suggestions
    for improving traditional scheduling algorithms, and adding other new requirements.
    Naturally, the developer will use this information to enhance the software until
    the user''s approval and satisfaction are obtained, after which the software will
    be fully implemented, tested, and maintained. 3.2. Analysis of PCW structure material
    and the thermal network DTs model of intelligent buildings During the construction
    of the building, the materials used in the PCW structure are the basis of the
    thermal energy storage system. A PCM transforms its physical properties and absorbs
    or releases a large amount of heat as the temperature changes [32]. At present,
    PCMs commonly used in building materials usually exist in the form of solid–liquid
    mixed storage. They have the advantages of low price, high energy density, constant
    temperature storage, small occupied volume, and long service life and have been
    widely concerned by scholars in related fields. If the PCM is filled in the building,
    the PCM wall can be formed [33]. Liu et al. (2020) designed shape-stabilized PCMs
    with desirable latent enthalpies and found that these materials had satisfactory
    shape stability as well as excellent thermal energy management [34]. Here, the
    PCM is placed in the indoor building structure. The DTs technology is introduced
    to establish a DTs model of the PCW material and its thermal network in an intelligent
    building, as presented in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Energy conversion diagram for Scheme 3. In
    Scheme 3, the cooling or heating used by the user end adopts the conventional
    power grid''s maximum output operation mode and only uses the microgrid battery
    energy storage system as a rotating backup. Fig. 3 presents the energy conversion
    diagram for Scheme 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the PE data of the intelligent building
    wall is mapped into the virtual space through DTs technology after collection.
    It is assumed that the three sides of the virtual wall of the intelligent building
    (including the PCW) face the shade, and the other side is subject to solar radiation
    (named wall No. 1). Besides, the convective heat exchange between the air gap
    of the PCM wall and the room air is enhanced by installing a forced air circulation
    system in the phase change wall. At the same time, the thermodynamic model takes
    into account the heat leakage of the PCM to the indoor and outdoor environments,
    which contributes to the thermal balance between the nodes of the intelligent
    building. In this thermal network model, solar radiation is expressed as ; the
    input variables include the ambient temperature and the temperature of the PCM;
    the controllable variable is the circulating air velocity ; the state variables
    include the indoor air temperature , the PCM wall air gap air temperature , and
    the internal and external surface temperature of the structure , where N = 4 represents
    the number of walls. Take the cooling mode of the intelligent building thermal
    network in summer and the heating mode in winter as an example. According to the
    law of thermodynamics, the uncontrollable heat leakage of PCM at time t includes
    indicators such as , , , , and [35]. refers to the total amount of uncontrollable
    heat leakage from PCM to the inside and outside of the building; and represent
    the heat leaked from PCM to the outer wall of the building phase change wall through
    conduction and radiation; and indicate the heat leaked from PCM to the building
    phase change wall through conduction and radiation of the inner wall. The details
    are shown in Equations (1)∼(5): (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) In Equations (1) ∼ (5), ,
    , , and represent the heat conduction and heat radiation coefficients of the PCM
    and the outer wall and inner wall; and refer to the contact area between the outer
    and inner layers of the wall and the air gap of the phase change layer, respectively;
    and denote the nodal temperature of the outer and inner walls of the PCW. The
    controllable heat transfer of the forced air circulation at time t is calculated
    as the enthalpy change difference between the air inlet and outlet of the PCW,
    as shown in Equation (6). (6) In Equation (6), indicates the specific heat capacity
    of air; denotes the indoor air temperature; refers to the circulating air flow
    rate, which at any moment t is bounded by the maximum air flow rate , expressed
    as . Equation (6) is a bilinear expression multiplying the controllable variable
    circulating air flow rate and the state variable room air temperature . The transformation
    of Equation (6) is briefly discussed. If the circulating air flow rate , the optimization
    of indoor air temperature should be kept at the upper limit of human comfort temperature
    under the summer cooling release mode working condition. Otherwise, the circulating
    air flow rate in the indoor circulation air can be further reduced to reduce the
    energy loss of the thermal energy storage system. If the circulating air flow
    rate mt = 0, the controlled heat transfer in Equation (6) is always 0 under any
    [36], [37]. Therefore, the constant human comfort temperature upper limit can
    be replaced by the variable indoor air temperature . Equation (6) can be transformed
    into the linear formula shown in Equation (7). (7) Therefore, after the comprehensive
    analysis of Equations (1) ∼ (7), the total heat load of the building is expressed
    as the total energy of controllable heat transfer and uncontrollable heat leakage,
    as presented in Equation (8). (8) In addition, the thermal balance correlation
    of intelligent buildings can be further analyzed according to the above equations.
    Equation (9) indicates the PCM heat balance. (9) In Equation (9), refers to the
    heat flow from the air gap of PCW to PCM at time t. The heat flow from the external
    environment to the outer PCW is equal to the heat transfer between the outer PCW
    and the air gap or between PCM and other building walls. Thus, the heat balance
    of the outer PCW can be expressed as Equation (10). (10) In Equation (10), and
    refer to the heat loss of the outer PCW and the heat flow from the external environment
    to the outer PCW at time t, respectively; represents the heat flow from the remaining
    walls of the building to the outer PCW at time t. The heat exchange between the
    room air and the inner surface of the other walls to the phase change interior
    wall is equal to the heat exchange between the phase change interior wall and
    the air gap, PCM, and the inner surface of the other walls. Hence, the heat balance
    of the inner PCW can be written as Equation (11). (11) In Equation (11), signifies
    the heat flow from the rest of the building walls to the inner PCW at time t;
    refers to the heat flow of the envelope j to the inner PCW at time t, denotes
    the heat flow from the room air to the inner PCW at time t. Equations (12) ∼ (14)
    express the heat balance of each wall of the building [38]. (12) (13) (14) Equations
    (12), (13) represent the thermal balance relationship between each building wall
    and the outside world. Equation (14) indicates the thermal balance relationship
    between each building wall and indoor air and other walls. refers to the heat
    loss of the enclosure structure k at time t; represents the heat flow from the
    remaining walls of the building to the enclosure structure k at time t; denotes
    the radiation heat transfer from the external environment to the enclosure structure
    k at time t; signifies the heat flow from the enclosure structure k to the room
    at time t; stands for the heat flow from the envelope structure k to the envelope
    structure j at time t. The heat exchange of the solar radiation wall (Wall 1)
    of the building is marked as , as shown in Equation (15). (15) In Equation (15),
    refers to the radiation heat transfer coefficient. The heat exchange from room
    air to the PCM and the inner PCW is equal to the heat exchange between the other
    walls except for the PCW and the room air. That is, the heat balance can be expressed
    as Equation (16). (16) This work investigates the pertinent theories of phase
    change materials and explains the thermodynamic content of phase change materials
    when applied to intelligent buildings. The findings provide the foundation for
    the following thermodynamic energy storage and dispatching models for intelligent
    buildings. 3.3. Analysis of the thermal energy storage and dispatch model based
    on DTs of intelligent buildings Because the building has a certain heat capacity,
    when the thermal power changes, the indoor temperature changes relatively lag,
    but the human body has a certain range of comfortable temperatures. The energy
    storage characteristics of PCMs can meet the indoor cooling/heating needs of buildings.

    based on DTs for intelligent buildings. In Fig. 4, the physical space is a complex,
    dynamic architectural environment consisting of the data collection layer, the
    data analysis layer, and the network perception layer. The five major elements
    of the data collection layer are construction personnel, mechanical equipment,
    materials, work methods, and the environment. It collects the most original data
    sources related to intelligent buildings. Then, the data analysis layer processes
    the acquired data sources to form economic cost data, environmental cost data,
    energy cost data, and construction safety data, respectively. The model transmits
    the multi-source heterogeneous data obtained from the analysis and processing
    layers to the virtual space and simultaneously receives instructions from the
    virtual space, and reacts accordingly. The network perception layer is responsible
    for the perception and collection of data and the transmission of data to the
    virtual space. The model uploads real-time data of construction activities into
    the virtual space by establishing a set of standard data interfaces and communication
    protocols in the network module to achieve uniform conversion and transmission
    of data from different sources. The thermal energy storage and distribution of
    intelligent buildings in this model rely heavily on PCM phase change walls. There
    is no need to transform light energy and local scattered energy into heat energy
    for building walls when generating electricity. The thermal energy of the building
    wall is converted into electrical energy for the user end by the generator, and
    the battery system provides the rotating reserve capacity for the wind/solar/storage
    grid. Following is a description of the relevant thermal energy scheduling mechanism
    involved. Here, refers to the heat dissipation power of the building (kW); represents
    the outdoor temperature (℃); signifies the indoor temperature (℃); refers to the
    specific heat capacity of the air, and the unit is kJ/(kg·K). From the two working
    conditions of heating in winter and cooling in summer, the relationship between
    the heat inside and outside the building and the temperature is expressed as Equations
    (17), (18). (17) (18) Equations (17), (18) represent the two working conditions
    of heating in winter and cooling in summer, respectively. stands for the air density
    (kg/m 3); refers to the heating power in winter (kW); signifies the cooling power
    (kW) in summer; refers to the volume capacity of the building. Assume that the
    heat dissipation power of the building is unchanged during the heat release and
    heat storage process. Then, the maximum charge and discharge energy (kW) provided
    by the building energy storage can be expressed as Equation (19). (19) The indoor
    temperature of a building is a response to a combination of factors, such as outdoor
    temperature, solar radiation, and indoor heat sources. To simplify the calculation,
    the external wall of the building is conducted as one-dimensional heat output
    according to the relevant thermodynamic knowledge. According to the law of energy
    conservation, the heat balance of the indoor temperature node is established as
    Equation (20). (20) In Equation (20), refers to the convective heat transfer coefficient
    of the interior wall surface; denotes the surface area of the external wall; stands
    for the thermal conductivity of the window; refers to the area of the window;
    stands for the interval time period; represents the convective heat transfer of
    the indoor heat source; refers to the number of air changes; indicates the solar
    heat gained through windows; refers to the indoor heat source radiating heat.
    Further, the multiobjective operation optimization modeling is carried out on
    the thermal energy storage and scheduling model of intelligent buildings. Its
    objective function is analyzed in terms of economic cost, environmental cost,
    and energy cost, respectively. The financial cost mainly includes the fuel cost
    of power generation by the system, the power purchase cost of the system from
    the grid, and the cost of equipment maintenance. The fuel cost generated by the
    consumption of natural gas by the micro gas turbine is calculated according to
    Equation (21). (21) In Equation (21), refers to the unit price of natural gas,
    and represents the unit volume of natural gas. The power purchase cost of the
    system is expressed as Equation (22). (22) In Equation (22), T refers to a dispatch
    cycle; represents the power purchased from the microgrid to the grid in the t
    period; stands for the power sold by the microgrid to the grid in the t period
    (kW); refers to the electricity purchase price in the t period; signifies the
    point-of-sale electricity price from the microgrid to the larger grid in period
    t. The maintenance cost of the system can be expressed as Equation (23). (23)
    In Equation (23), , , and refer to the fan output, PV output, and battery charge
    and discharge power, respectively (positive when charging and negative when discharging);
    , , , , and represent the maintenance costs of fans, PVs, batteries, micro gas
    turbines, waste heat boilers, and absorption chillers, respectively. Therefore,
    the minimum objective function of economic cost is written as Equation (24). (24)
    Environmental costs mainly consider carbon dioxide emissions. The system uses
    natural gas as fuel. The combustion of natural gas produces carbon dioxide and
    water. The power purchased by the system from the grid is also derived from the
    electricity generated by thermal power plants, which also produce carbon dioxide.
    Thus, the environmental cost is represented by the carbon dioxide conversion coefficient
    [39]. The objective function for the minimum carbon dioxide emission of the system
    is: (25) where and refer to the carbon dioxide conversion coefficient of natural
    gas and electric energy, respectively. Energy cost is the amount of energy consumed.
    As primary energy, natural gas belongs to non-renewable energy. Now, fossil energy
    has been exhausted day by day [40], [41]. The objective function for minimizing
    energy consumption and energy waste is written as Equation (26). (26) In Equation
    (26), refers to the daily cooling capacity of the microgrid in the smart building
    thermal energy storage and dispatch model; represents the daily heat supply produced
    by the microgrid in the model; denotes the daily power generation of the microgrid
    in the system. 3.4. Experimental performance evaluation A case study is performed
    to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed thermal energy storage
    and scheduling model based on DTs of smart buildings. This section selects a typical
    photovoltaic-integrated smart building group as the research object. The specific
    environment and parameter settings are as follows. The total installed capacity
    of rooftop photovoltaics in the smart building group is 1500 kW, and the total
    number of rooms equipped with phase-change material energy storage systems is
    400. The size of the room is 4500 × 4500 × 3400 mm, and the mass of phase change
    material configured on the wall of each room is 600 kg. A 3 kW heat pump and a
    circulation fan with a maximum air velocity of 5 kg/s are installed. In this experiment,
    the hardware and software configurations are as follows. In the software, the
    operating system is Linux 64bit, the Python version is Python 3.6.1, and the development
    platform is PyCharm; in the hardware, the CPU is an Intel core i7-7700@4. 2 GHz
    8-core, the memory is Kingston ddr4 2400 MHz 16G, and the GPU is an Nvidia GeForce
    1060 8G. For the sake of focus and hypothesis analysis, this work assumes that
    all rooms have the same comfort temperature interval and uses a centralized control
    strategy of the energy management system. The energy dispatch center sends dispatching
    commands to the building thermal energy storage system in each house to control
    the heat pump power and circulating air flow rate of the building thermal energy
    storage system in each house. The model developed during this study is referred
    to as scheme 1. It transfers the heat energy from the building''s walls into electrical
    energy for power generation using a generator. The spinning reserve capacity of
    the wind/solar/storage grids is provided by the battery system''s comprehensive
    utilization. As evidence of the superiority of the proposed technique, the following
    two plans are presented for comparison. Scheme 2 combines the energy storage effect
    of the wall with other equipment such as wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, and
    battery energy storage systems and only uses the battery energy storage system
    as a spinning backup. In Scheme 3, the cooling or heating used by the user end
    adopts the conventional power grid''s maximum output operation mode and only uses
    the microgrid battery energy storage system as a rotating backup. 4. Results and
    discussion 4.1. System optimization power under different schemes Fig. 5 compares
    the three schemes mentioned above to explore the optimal power of the system.
    In Fig. 5, the power station output represents the electric energy generated by
    the microgrid power station; the battery output represents the electric energy
    generated by the microgrid battery energy storage system; the net load power is
    the sum of the power station output and the battery output power. Download : Download

    distribution of the system under different schemes (a. Scheme 1; b. Scheme 2;
    c. Scheme 3). It can be seen from Fig. 5 that under the three schemes, the net
    load is negative from 1:00 to 4:00; the output of wind power and PVs is greater
    than the conventional grid load. Scheme 3 adopts the maximum output operation
    mode to maintain a high output; Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 consider the dynamic energy
    storage characteristics of the building wall energy storage, avoiding battery
    overcharge to dissipate a large amount of surplus renewable energy and consuming
    less. At 21:00, when the net load is in the peak period, the wind power and PV
    output cannot meet the normal load demand. Users of Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 need
    to purchase electricity from the power station to run at close to full power generation
    power, avoiding the need for the battery to meet a large number of loads. It can
    effectively reduce the peak-to-valley difference of the equivalent load of the
    microgrid and play the role of shifting peaks and filling valleys. The above analysis
    demonstrates that the scheduling and operation strategy of the building wall energy
    storage with dynamic energy storage characteristics is considered in this scheme
    with a great degree of flexibility. It can avoid the overcharge or over-discharge
    of the battery in the microgrid, reduce the power consumption of the battery,
    and extend the service life of the battery to a certain extent. Fig. 6 reveals
    the deterministic dispatch under the conditions of electricity-thermal uncertainty

    building energy storage system, and energy storage capacity of PCW. Download :

    dispatching power consumption and day-ahead power consumption under different
    schemes (a. Scheme 2; b. Scheme 3; c. Scheme 1). According to Fig. 6, under different
    schemes, the PV power generation is not enough to meet the user''s electricity
    demand during the period of 1:00–6:00, 13:00–14:00, and 19:00–24:00 every day.
    Therefore, smart building micro-grid users meet the demand for conventional electrical
    loads by purchasing the right amount of electricity from the grid. Then, the remaining
    electricity is converted into thermal energy by the heat pump and delivered to
    the building phase change energy storage system to meet the heat demand of island
    residents. During the hours of 7:00–13:00 and 15:00–18:00 when the PV power is
    generated, the island intelligent building micro-grid does not purchase electricity
    from outside or sell electricity in small amounts at a fixed price. Moreover,
    the surplus electricity of the island micro-grid is converted into thermal energy
    of the building phase change energy storage system for storage. Besides, the energy
    is released through the phase change material and forced air circulation system
    in the intelligent building to directly meet the thermal demand of the island
    residents. Scheme 1 can convert the thermal energy of the building wall into electric
    energy for the user end through the generator and comprehensively utilize the
    battery system to provide the rotating reserve capacity of the wind/solar/storage
    grid. Therefore, the power purchase required in Scheme 1 is significantly less
    than that in Scheme 2 and Scheme 3, while the electricity sold is obviously larger
    than that in Scheme 2 and Scheme 3. In addition, the analysis of the PCW energy
    storage system for intelligent buildings in the three schemes indicates that the
    capacity of Scheme 1 is always in the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on the all-weather scale;
    the capacities of Scheme 2 and Scheme 3 are smaller than Scheme 1. The result
    suggests that the DTs-based intelligent building thermal energy storage and dispatching
    model constructed here has no thermal energy loss exhaustion or inflow overflow
    and realizes long-term peak-shaving and valley-filling of large power grid loads.
    The PV-integrated buildings reported here are compared with traditional residential
    buildings and office buildings in terms of electrical load and indoor heat source
    values, as shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download

    values for different types of buildings. It can be seen from the Fig. 7 that the
    electric load value consumed by office buildings is the largest and the indoor
    heat source value is higher. The photovoltaic integrated buildings constructed
    in this study can have a higher indoor heat source while maintaining a lower electrical
    load value. Therefore, the PV-integrated buildings constructed here have a better
    wall energy storage effect and lower power consumption compared with residential
    and office buildings. 4.2. Cost consumption under different schemes The thermal
    energy storage and dispatch model of smart buildings based on DTs reported here
    is compared with the models proposed by Antoniadou-Plytaria et al. (2020), Cui
    et al. (2020), Ren et al. (2021), and Dong et al. (2022) The algorithm under different
    risk indicators (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) from the perspectives of economic cost,
    environmental cost, and energy cost. Fig. 8 provides the results. Download : Download

    economic cost, environmental cost, and energy cost with the increase of risk indicators
    under different models (a. economic cost; b. environmental cost; c. energy cost).
    Fig. 8a shows that with the increase of risk indicators, the economic cost required
    by each model algorithm increases sequentially, and the cost required by the model
    reported here is significantly lower than that of other model algorithms. In Fig.
    8b, as the risk index increases, the environmental cost required by each model
    algorithm increases sequentially. The cost of the research model is significantly
    lower than other model algorithms. In Fig. 8c, as the risk index increases, the
    energy cost required by each model algorithm increases sequentially. The cost
    of the research model is significantly lower than other model algorithms. The
    model reported here achieves functional regulation and reduces the consumption
    of economic costs, environmental costs, and energy costs. Therefore, the thermal
    energy storage and dispatching model of intelligent buildings based on DTs constructed
    here can enhance the energy storage effects of buildings, cut down economic costs,
    environmental costs, and energy costs, and enhance safety performance. 5. Discussion
    The comparability and verification of the smart building thermal energy storage
    and dispatching model based on DTs'' viability and efficiency. First, three schemes
    were used to conduct a system-optimized power analysis. It was discovered that
    the thermal energy dispatching mechanism described in this study can extend the
    battery''s service life to some degree. Simultaneously, analyses of the deterministic
    scheduling power consumption and day-ahead trading power under distinct strategies.
    The DTs-based intelligent building thermal energy storage and scheduling model
    developed here lacks both thermal energy loss exhaustion and inflow overflow.
    This may be because this research model avoids over-discharge of the battery to
    meet a large number of load demands, which can effectively reduce the peak-to-valley
    difference of the equivalent load of the microgrid and play the role of shifting
    peaks and filling valleys to realize long-term maintenance of large power grid
    loads. This is consistent with the views put forward by Pekárová et al. (2022)
    [42] and Zhao et al. (2022) [43]. This work is compared with the research of scholars
    in related fields in terms of economic cost, environmental cost, and energy cost.
    It can be found that with the increase of risk indicators, the economic cost,
    environmental cost, and energy cost required by each model algorithm increase
    in turn. And, the cost of the model reported here is significantly lower than
    other model algorithms. This may be because DTs technology can digitally interact
    with the construction status and information of the building complex when building
    photovoltaic integrated buildings, make quick decisions about problems that come
    up during construction and the operating status of equipment and components, and
    then control functions. This is consistent with the view put forward by Odukomaiya
    et al. (2021) [44]. Finally, it shows that the thermal energy storage and scheduling
    model of intelligent building based on DTs built here can provide experimental
    basis and development direction for the intelligent development and sustainable
    economic development in the follow-up construction field. 6. Conclusion In the
    era of rapid development of information technology, the construction sector is
    also developing in the intellectual direction. The innovation and contribution
    of this work lie in the incorporation of DTs technology into the design of intelligent
    buildings so that the data generated by the energy storage systems of intelligent
    buildings in the real world can be mapped to the virtual world for simultaneous
    analysis in real time. Simultaneously, the PCM wall construction and thermal energy
    storage and distribution model of the thermoelectric intelligent building are
    built. When power generation is required, the thermal energy scheduling mode used
    here transfers building wall thermal energy through a generator into electrical
    energy for user-end usage. Experimental evaluations show that the energy storage
    capacity of building walls consistently remains in the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on an
    all-weather scale. From the perspective of cost consumption, the economic cost,
    environmental cost, and energy cost of the model reported are significantly lower
    than the existing model. This work contributes to the subsequent intelligent development
    of the building field and sustainable economic development. However, there are
    some deficiencies in this work. For the convenience of modeling and calculation,
    this work did not consider the impact of numerous other secondary factors, such
    as temperature fluctuations in the environment, PV cell temperature variations,
    and wind speed, on building wall energy storage scheduling. Therefore, follow-up
    research will improve the environmental factors and uncertainties in the building
    construction process to explore the effect of the robust dispatching strategy
    of the building microgrid. In addition, different residents'' preferences for
    temperature were not taken into account. It is also an added factor in the improvement
    of the energy storage system of the subsequent intelligent building to put the
    system into practice against time. CRediT authorship contribution statement Zhihan

    Abstract: Future buildings will offer new convenience, comfort, and efficiency
    possibilities to their residents. Changes will occur to the way people live as
    technology involves people''s lives and information processing is fully integrated
    into their daily living activities and objects. The future expectation of smart
    buildings includes making the residents'' experience as easy and comfortable as
    possible. The massive streaming data generated and captured by smart building
    appliances and devices contain valuable information that needs to be mined to
    facilitate timely actions and better decision making. Machine learning and big
    data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role to enable the delivery of
    such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area of smart building with
    a special focus on the role of techniques from machine learning and big data analytics.
    This survey also reviews the current trends and challenges faced in the development
    of smart building services. The major machine learning tasks that are relevant
    to smart buildings include: data collection and acquisition, data pre-processing,
    and dimensionality reduction. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 7) Page(s):

    I. Introduction Although the term “smart building” (SB) may bring a thought of
    a fictional smart space from science-fiction movies, but the reality is that SBs
    exist today, and their number is getting increased. With recent advances in machine
    learning (ML), big data analytics, sensor technologies and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), regular buildings can be cost-effectively transformed into SBs with bare
    minimum infrastructural modifications. There are smart office, smart library,
    smart home, smart health care facilities, smart hospital and many other types
    of SBs that can provide automated services that can provide many value-added services
    (such as reduction of wasted energy) and also help to ensure the comfort, health,
    and safety of the occupants. The hyperconnectivity that will be brought about
    by the emergence of IoT will increase the promise of SB since now all the basic
    building amenities and commodities ranging from your house electronics to your
    plant vases will be interconnected. But this hyperconnectivity will at the same
    time complicate the process of managing SBs. In particular, SBs and their inhabitants
    are expected to create large volumes of streaming data. ML, sampling, compression,
    learning, and filtering technologies are becoming more significant to manage the
    stream of big data of individuals. In 1981, the term Intelligent Buildings (IBs)
    was initially coined by United Technology Building Systems (UTBS) Corporation
    in the U.S. In July 1983, IBs became a reality with the opening of the City Place
    Building in Hartford, Connecticut [1]. Today, the number of SBs is growing at
    an unprecedented rate including smart office, smart hospitality, smart educational
    facilities etc. [2]. An SB is recognized as an integrated system that takes advantage
    of a range of computational and communications infrastructure and techniques [3].
    Examples of SB services include smart thermostats that allow the temperature to
    be controlled based on the time of the day/year and the users’ preferences with
    minimal or no manual configuration. Using data analytics to “learn” the users’
    preferences before taking the appropriate actions is probably the most important
    enabling technology for IBs [4]. Lately, smart coffee machines appeared in the
    market with the capability to make coffee automatically, according to users’ preferences
    and schedules. Fridges can offer allocated programming interfaces for their control
    [5]. IBs aim to provide their users with safe, energy efficient, environment-friendly,
    and convenient services. In order to maximize comfort, minimize cost, and adapt
    to the needs of their inhabitants, SBs must rely on sophisticated tools to learn,
    predict, and make intelligent decisions. SB algorithms cover a range of technologies,
    including prediction, decision-making, robotics, smart materials, wireless sensor
    networks, multimedia, mobile computing, and cloud computing. With these technologies,
    buildings can cognitively manage many SB services such as security, privacy, energy
    efficiency, lighting, maintenance, elderly care, and multimedia entertainment.
    The massive volume of sensory data collected from sensors and appliances must
    be analyzed by algorithms, transformed into information, and minted to extract
    knowledge so that machines can have a better understanding of humans than their
    environment. Furthermore, and most importantly, such knowledge can lead to new
    products and services that can dramatically transform our lives. For example,
    readings from smart meters can be used to better predict and balancing the usage
    of power. Monitoring and processing sensory data from wearable sensors attached
    to patients can produce new remote healthcare services. The main philosophy behind
    ML is to create the analytical models automatically in order to permit the algorithms
    to learn continuously from available data. The application of ML techniques increased
    over the last two decades due to the availability of massive amounts of complex
    data and the increased usability of current ML tools. Today, ML is already widely
    applied in different applications including recommendation systems offered by
    online services (e.g., Amazon, Netflix) and automatic credit rating services used
    by banks. Alphabet’s Nest thermostat utilizes ML to “learn” the temperature preferences
    of its users and adapt to their work schedule to minimize the energy use. Other
    widely publicized examples of ML applications include Google’s self-driving car,
    sentiment analysis of Amazon and Twitter data, fraud detection, and Facebook’s
    facial-recognition technology that is used to tag the suggested person on images
    uploaded by users. A. SB Trends and Market Impact In this section, we look at
    the statistics related to SBs, to allow us to understand the current trends and
    motivations in industry marketplaces and academic researches toward SBs. According
    to the report by MarketsandMarkets [6], The SB market is estimated to grow from
    7.42 billion dollars in 2017 to 31.74 billion dollars by 2022, at a Compound Annual
    Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.7% from 2017 to 2022. In yet another report Zion Market
    Research [7], 2016 and it is expected to reach 61,900 million dollars by 2024.
    It is expected to exhibit a CAGR of more than 34% between 2017 and 2024. The market
    is primarily driven by government initiatives globally for SB projects and the
    increasing market for integrated security and safety systems as well as energy
    efficient building systems. Figure 1 shows the Statista [8] forecast market size
    of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars). FIGURE
    1. Forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 [8].
    Show All According to the Gartner report [9], it is expected that the number of
    smart connected homes grows to 700 million homes by 2020, supplied by mass consumer
    adoption and an increase in the number of devices and apps available. Figure 2
    shows Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle expectation for deep learning, ML, connected homes,
    and smart workspace. FIGURE 2. Hype Cycle for the Connected Home, 2018 [7]. Show
    All According to report by Research and Markets [10], [11], the global IoT SB
    market will reach approximately $51.44B USD globally by 2023. The report also
    forecast that 33% of IoT SB market will be supplied by artificial intelligent
    technologies by 2023, and automation systems of SB will grow at 48.3% CAGR from
    2018–2023. Frost & Sullivan also predict that by 2025, the growth of connected
    home living will reach 3.7 billion smartphones, 700 million tablets, 520 million
    wearable health-related devices and 410 million smart appliances in the connected
    person world. B. Related Survey Papers Although many of survey papers focused
    on SBs have been published, none of them is focused on the role of data analytics
    and ML in the context of SBs. We describe the relevant survey papers next and
    will compare these survey papers to our paper in Table 2. Chan et al. in 2008
    provided an overview of smart home research [12]. It also discusses assistive
    robots, and wearable devices. The article reviews smart home projects arranged
    by country and continent. Alam et al. [13] provided details about sensors, devices,
    algorithms, and communication protocols utilized in smart homes. The paper reviews
    smart home works according to their desired services and research goals; namely,
    security, comfort, and healthcare. Lobaccaro et al. [14] presented the concept
    of smart home and smart grid technologies and discuss some challenges, benefits
    and future trends of smart home technologies. Pan et al. [15] reviewed the works
    on efficient energy consumption in SBs using microgrids. The survey investigates
    research topics and the recent advancements in SBs and the vision of microgrids.
    A few survey papers have reviewed works on facilitating independent living of
    the elderly people in smart homes. Ni et al. [16] conducted a survey on the features
    of sensing infrastructure and activities that can assist the independent living
    of the elderly in smart homes. A survey on ambient assisted living technologies
    for elderly people has been presented Rashidi and Mihailidis [17]. Peetoom et
    al. [18] focused on monitoring technologies to recognize life activities in-home
    such as fall detection and changes in health status. Salih et al. [19] presented
    a review of ambient intelligence assisted healthcare monitoring services and described
    the various application, communication, and wireless sensor network technologies
    that have been employed in the existing research literature. A number of papers
    have focused IoT: (a) Perera et al. [20] discussed IoT applications from the perspective
    of context-awareness and self-learning; (b) Tsai et al. [21] surveyed the applications
    of data mining technologies in IoT; and (c) Mahdavinejad et al. [22] reviewed
    some ML methods that can be applied to IoT data analytics. TABLE 1 List of Important
    Acronyms Used TABLE 2 Comparison of Relevant Survey Papers C. Contributions and
    Organization of This Paper To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey
    that covers SBs jointly from the perspectives of application, data analytics,
    and ML. The main contributions of our paper are: Exploration of the potential
    of ML-based context-aware systems to provide SB services; Identification of research
    challenges and directions for SBs and how ML models can help in resolving such
    challenges; Identification of SB applications including comfort, security, energy
    efficiency, and convenience and the role of ML in such applications. Our research
    can provide an impetus to ML researchers to investigate new exciting ML-based
    SB services. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces
    the concept of SBs and its underlying architecture. Section III introduces the
    various components of the SB ecosystem and its underlying architecture. Section
    V presents context recognition and activity modeling and the role of ML in SBs.
    Section VI highlights research and development challenges and provides a future
    perspective of SB projects. Finally, Section VII presents a summary of lessons
    learned and concludes the paper. For the convenience of the readers, we have enlisted
    the important acronyms used in Table 1. SECTION II. Smart Buildings: Concept and
    Architecture In 1984, The New York Times published an article that described that
    real estate developers are creating “a new generation of buildings that almost
    think for themselves called intelligent buildings.” Such an intelligent building
    (IB) was defined as “a marriage of two technologies - old-fashioned building management
    and telecommunications.” [23]. Since then, many definitions of SBs have been suggested.
    This is due to the fact that the life-cycle of building planning, design, implementation,
    and operation involves different industry players that have different roles. In
    addition, the rapid changes in technology are affecting this definition. For instance,
    the advent of IoT and smart city concepts is impacting the definition of SB. Therefore,
    it is hard to compose a unique view of IBs with a single definition that is accepted
    worldwide. However, it is vital to have a good understanding of the main standard
    bodies and companies involved in shaping the development of SBs [1]. The Institute
    for Building Efficiency [24] focuses on the operation of buildings to provide
    efficient healthy and comfortable environment [25]. IBM [26] focuses also on the
    operation of SBs to provide integrated physical and digital infrastructures that
    provide reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective occupancy services. According
    to the European Commission’s Information Society [27], SBs means buildings that
    are supplied by information and communication technologies in the context of the
    combining Ubiquitous Computing and the IoT: In general, the buildings that are
    supplied with sensors, actuators, microchips, micro- and nano-embedded systems
    in order to enable collecting, filtering and producing more information locally,
    to be further incorporated and managed globally according to business functions.”
    In SBs, a variety of AI and multi-agent system techniques are employed including
    [28]: Reasoning and knowledge representation including ontologies and rules to
    represent devices and building services. ML for human activity recognition. Multi-agent
    systems for distributed intelligence and semantic interoperability. Intelligent
    approaches such as planning, intelligent control, adaptive interfaces, and optimization
    for efficient management of resources and services. An SB is therefore the integration
    of a wide range of systems and services into a unified environment that involve
    energy management systems, temperature monitoring systems, access security systems,
    fire and life safety, lighting control and reduction, telecommunications services,
    office automation, computer systems, area locating systems, LANs, management information
    systems, cabling and records, maintenance systems, and expert systems [29]. Figure
    3 shows examples of SB appliances including air-conditioning systems, lighting
    systems, solar energy generators, power-supply systems, temperature sensors, humidity
    sensors, power usage sensors, and surveillance cameras. For example, centralized
    control of these elements can promote the efficient use of energy through the
    intelligent control of lights and air conditioning units and the intelligent management
    of multiple green and brown energy sources. In most cases, an SB uses an Ethernet
    backbone with bridges to a Controller Area Network (CAN) [26]. FIGURE 3. Example
    of SB appliances. Show All It is easier to introduce smart services in residential
    buildings compared to commercial buildings since residential buildings have less
    technical equipment and less stringent efficiency requirements. Because the commercial
    buildings usually have more public visitors and therefore building models for
    commercial buildings are usually more challenging than building models for residential
    buildings which usually have a limited number of the occupants most of the time.
    In addition, the costs associated with the purchase and installation of smart
    devices and infrastructure at commercial buildings is more than residential buildings.
    Figure 4 shows an integrated framework in a residential building that employs
    a network of intelligent sensors. These sensors control systems such as energy
    generation, metering, HVAC, lighting, and security. A building automation system
    manages a set of smart appliances, sensors, and actuators, which collectively
    deliver services for the well-being of the inhabitants. Examples of such smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators include washers and dryers, refrigerators,
    heaters, thermostats, lighting systems, power outlets, energy meters, smoke detectors,
    televisions, game consoles, windows/door controllers and sensors, air conditioners,
    video cameras, and sound detectors. More advanced smart devices are constantly
    being developed like smart floors and smart furniture [28], [30]. FIGURE 4. Smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators in a smart residential building. Show All The
    IoT will enable the integration and interoperability of heterogeneous devices
    in SBs as well as the real-time processing of the data generated by sensors in
    support of optimal control and operation of the building. In this paper, We propose
    a layered architecture for SBs based on the layered architecture of IoT. Figure
    5 shows the layered architecture of SBs. FIGURE 5. Layers of the base IoT architecture
    that serves as the foundation for SBs. Show All As can be seen from the sensing
    layer (the bottom layer in Figure 5), input data is obtained from different types
    of physical sensors that monitor environmental parameters, collect data about
    residents and detect anomalies (e.g., fire and water pipe bursts). This layer
    also includes actuators that can be controlled to save energy, minimize water
    consumption, etc. The network layer (the second layer in Figure 5), includes access
    and core networks that provide transparent data transmission capability. This
    layer serves as a bridge between the sensing layer and the upper layers which
    are mainly responsible for data processing. An intermediary software layer called
    the middleware layer is needed (the third layer in Figure 5) to provide seamless
    integration of heterogeneous devices and networks covered by the sensing layer
    of the architecture. That layer serves as a bridge between the embedded software
    that runs of smart sensors and back-end software services. This layer provides
    interoperability using standardized programming interfaces and protocols [31].
    Therefore, this layer performs the process of converting the collected data from
    various data formats into a common representation. SB middleware can be based
    on open standards or proprietary, in addition, application-specific or general-purpose.
    Most often, proprietary middleware is application-specific while general-purpose
    middleware is based on open standards [28]. The context and semantic discovery
    layer (the fourth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for managing context and semantic
    discoverers including context and semantics generating, configuring, and storing.
    The processing and reasoning layer (the fifth layer in Figure 5) is responsible
    for processing the extracted information from the middleware then according to
    the application’s type it will make decisions. In this layer, there are various
    techniques of information processing applied to fuse, extract, contextualize.
    massive data into useful actionable knowledge. In this layer, two phases should
    be identified: context consumer and context producer of the middleware. In the
    context consumer phase, the data processing techniques are applied on the data
    produced by the middleware; while in context producer phase the process of decision-making
    is implemented to supply the service layer with valuable knowledge. while in the
    second stage, further context information can be provided to the middleware for
    registration in the ontology context. Specific services and applications are abstracted
    in the application layer (the top-most layer in Figure 5). This layer presents
    a framework with direct access to the underlying functionalities to serve in the
    implementation of various types of applications. Moreover, control panels should
    be installed in the building to control the automated indoor spaces and to support
    a local human-machine interface. For instance, in a multi-story building, each
    floor could have a control panel to automate the operations, such as control opening
    the windows, control of air conditioning to achieve the desired temperature, control
    close/open the blinds according to the preferred light intensity before using
    artificial lighting [32], [33]. Summary: Still there is no single standard definition
    for SBs. In this section, we reviewed many definitions for SBs by many institutes,
    counties, regions and different disciplines; each has their own definition for
    SBs. We presented the layered architectural pattern for adapting services in an
    SB environment. We wanted to provide a general design for adapting actions according
    to the different versions of context in SBs. This architecture may be used in
    different smart environments such as intelligent transport systems, security,
    health assistance, and SBs among others. We layered the architecture into six
    layers starting from the sensing layer, which includes various types of sensors
    that are installed to collect environmental information in SBs. While network
    layer providing data stream support and data flow control and ensuring that messages
    arrive reliably by using data transport protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet
    etc. Data Acquisition layer to collect the data from the heterogeneous sources
    of data. Context and semantic discovery layer to generate, configure, and store
    context and semantic information. Context processing and reasoning layer to process
    the information and extract the knowledge that making the decisions according
    to the application context. And the last layer which is application layer such
    as health assistance and elderly home care, comfort and entertainment services,
    security, tele-management, smart watering, energy efficiency, etc. After discussing
    the main components of commercial and residential buildings, we have now set the
    stage for a detailed discussion on the components of SBs in the next section.
    SECTION III. Smart Building Components Advances in smart building technology have
    driven to the extensive development of SBs to generate economic and environmental
    benefits for building owners through the convergence of IT and building automation
    systems. Figure 6 shows the key components of SB systems, these include extensive
    sensors and actuators systems, networking and communication systems, software
    platform system, HVAC system, and smart control devices. FIGURE 6. Components
    of smart buildings. Show All Current systems utilize control devices and smart
    sensors that are connected to a central system. These control devices and smart
    sensors are placed throughout the environment. Each particular system has its
    own collection of networking and communication systems that enable it to communicate
    with the central system. SBs are performing connected networks that serve as a
    communication backbone for multiple systems. In many ways, HVAC equipment is the
    most complicated building system, with numerous components arranged to produce
    heating, cooling, and ventilation. The functionality of HVAC system not only makes
    the building healthy and comfortable for its inhabitants, but it also manages
    a big part of the energy consumed, as well as plays a significant role in life
    safety. SBs adopt technology to monitor and control facility systems and perform
    any required modifications. The objective of an SB is to utilize computers and
    software to control lighting, alarm systems, HVAC, and other systems through a
    single computer interface. A. Sensors and Actuators for SBs Sensors and actuators
    are mechanical components that measure and control the environmental values of
    their environment. Sensors collect information from the environment and make it
    ready for the system. For instance, IR sensors can be utilized for human presence
    detection in a room. While actuator is a device to convert an electrical control
    signal to a physical action, such that it takes decisions and then performs proper
    actions according to the environment, which enables automated and remote interaction
    with the environment.For example, a light actuator is capable of switching on/off,
    dimming one or more electric lights [34]. The rapid development of micromechanics,
    microelectronics, integrated optics, and other related technologies has facilitated
    the development of different types of smart sensors integrated into daily objects
    and infrastructure at smart building environment or worn by the users, and are
    connected by network technologies in order to collect contextual information about
    daily living activities more efficiently and faster, with lower energy consumption
    and less processing resources. Environmental sensors are utilized for detecting
    the human activity of a specific object that performed in specific locations in
    the building, while wearable sensors are utilized for controlling and observing
    mobile activities and physiological signals [35]. 1) Environmental Sensors It
    is found that data collected from environmental sensors can form important information
    to monitor human behaviors within an SB. These sensory data are then analyzed
    to identify and observe basic and instrumental daily living activities made by
    occupants such as bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, taking medication etc.
    The environmental sensing is generally based on several simple binary sensors
    in every part of the home, RFID technology, and video cameras. This variety of
    sensing may implement important insight into contexts and actual activities although
    it might come with possible costs such as complexity. Motion sensors are utilized
    for detecting the occupant’s presence and location everywhere in the house. There
    are different types of motion sensors. IR presence sensor is one of the most utilized
    kind of motion sensors in SBs to detect occupants’ presence. Pressure sensors
    can be attached to the objects such as beds, chairs, sofas, and floors in order
    to track the actions and locations of the occupants. While Contact switches are
    usually placed on the doors of fridge, rooms, or cabinets to detect the actions
    that the occupant makes with these objects [36]. Light sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, or power sensors are other types of sensors that are deployed
    and utilized in SB to recognize the activities. Light sensors are utilized to
    measure the light intensity in a particular room in the building. Humidity sensors
    are utilized to detect the air humidity of a specific location in the building.
    Temperature sensors are utilized to measure the temperature of the specific environment.
    while the power sensors are utilized to identify the power usage of electric devices.
    2) Wearable Sensors and Biosensors These sensors are attached directly or indirectly
    to the user body. Their small size enables these sensors to be attached to clothes,
    wristwatches, glasses, belts, shoes etc. These sensors can be categorized into
    inertial sensors and vital sign sensors (or biosensors). Wearable inertial sensors
    are highly transportable and no stationary units that can give accurately detailed
    features of occupant’s action and body posture. Those sensors are composed of
    accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. There is a need for receivers
    and cameras in the process of data collection, therefore can be used outside laboratory
    circumstances [37]. Wearable biosensors such as blood pressure, skin temperature,
    and heart rate are significant for collecting vital signs to monitor the health.
    The most commonly utilized inertial sensors for mobile activity monitoring are
    accelerometers and gyroscopes. Accelerometers can be utilized to measure the rate
    of acceleration accompanying a sensitive axis, they are useful to monitor the
    motion’s activities such as doing exercise, standing, sitting, walking, or walking
    upstairs and downstairs. While the gyroscopes can be utilized to measure angular
    velocity and maintain orientation. Some examples of primary vital signs are Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and respiratory
    rate. There are various vital sign sensor utilized to measure different vital
    signals such as Electroencephalography sensors (EEG) for observing electrical
    brain activity, Electrooculography sensors (EOG) for observing eye movement in
    ocular activity, Electromyography sensors (EMG) for observing muscle activity.
    Electrocardiography sensors (ECG) for observing cardiac activity, pressure sensors
    for observing blood pressure, CO2 gas sensors for observing respiration, thermal
    sensors for observing body temperature and galvanic skin response for observing
    skin sweating [38], [39]. 3) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
    HVAC system plays an essential role in SB services. HVAC system plays a remarkable
    role in efficient energy consumption in SBs, as well as it offers new operating
    options to increase the occupants’ comfort. In addition to meeting the desired
    temperature, HVAC control systems are produced in order to sustain comfort within
    an enclosed space by producing a specific level of humidity, pressure, air motion,
    and air quality in an SB [40]. CO2, humidity and temperature levels in a building
    can affect occupant’s health and comfort; consequently measuring CO2, humidity,
    and temperature in this context can improve personal wellbeing [41]. Heating and
    cooling systems consume a huge amount of energy in the buildings, so it is necessary
    to optimize it utilizing smart controllers and sensors in order to save operational
    costs. Smart HVAC systems can sense and control efficiently different air quality
    parameters inside the building by utilizing distributed sensors and VAV fans throughout
    the building to perform an optimal ventilation [42]. Most of the current HVAC
    actuation systems in smart buildings are based on the data collected about the
    occupants using sensors and cameras, which are utilized specifically for HVAC
    systems. Certainly, There is a specific cost for the design, maintenance, setup
    and hardware of the data collection network [43]. Table 3 shows a summary for
    different types of smart sensors in the SBs. TABLE 3 Various Smart Sensors Useful
    in the Context of SBs B. Smart Control Devices Smart control devices collect data
    from a variety of sensors, process this data, and activate actuators to react
    to the events detected by the sensors. A smart control device can operate independently,
    without control by a central server. But there might be a needed communication
    amongst various control devices or they can connect with each other using the
    smart gateway. WeMo [44] is a Wi-Fi enabled switch utilized to turn electronic
    devices on/off from anywhere. It can control LED motion sensors, light bulbs,
    mart wall switches and plugs, and lighting devices, all from the smartphone app
    or browser. There is no hub needed for WeMo devices, everything can be managed
    through the free cloud service provided by Belkin. You can use the specific channel
    to connect the device to e-services such as Gmail to trigger specific actions.
    WeMo devices also support context-aware feature, it turns on/off automatically
    according to the time of day, whether it is sunrise or sunset etc. The Nest thermostat
    [45], a smart device developed by Nest—which has been acquired by Google—adjusts
    to your life and seasons change automatically. Just use it for a week and it programs
    itself. It learns about the level of temperatures that the occupants prefer and
    creates a context-aware personalized schedule. The smart thermostat turns to an
    energy-efficient mode automatically when the residents leave the building. It
    could start warming up the area when it senses activity, such as an occupant’s
    returning back home from work. The Nest Thermostat is controllable via a smartphone
    and an installed app. If you are away for a while, this device has also a capability
    to sustain a particular temperature in your house. Lockitron [46] is a door lock
    that can control the door remotely over the Internet to open and close it by phone.
    Lockitron app can be installed and used by any iOS or Android smartphone. Homeowners
    can directly grant family and friends the access to open a given door by providing
    authorization over the Internet. Lockitron can also utilize Bluetooth low energy
    technology, which means that it will keep controlling even in the event of Internet
    or power outages. Lockitron can also connect to the Internet with Bridge, through
    which occupants can control the bolt anywhere in the world. The SmartThings [47]
    SB automation system comprised of a communications smart hub, that supports various
    smart appliances and devices; the smart hub supports various technologies and
    protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, as well as IP-accessible devices and lets you
    control appliances using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. SmartThings provides
    kits that include smart plugs, in addition, the basic sensors that can be utilized
    to measure temperature, as well as to detect presence, motion, orientation, and
    vibration. SmartThings also includes an open platform that enables smart device
    vendors and third-party software to provide hardware and software that can be
    utilized alongside the platform. Philips Hue [48] is a combination of LED lighting
    with mobile technology. An accompanying mobile app that allows you to control
    lighting systems and changing color sets depending on your mood utilizing Wi-Fi
    technology. The new Philips Hue bridge supports the required authentication to
    enable Apple HomeKit technology to control and enable your Philips Hue to connect
    to other HomeKit enabled accessories and take control of your home. Blufitbottle
    [49] this bottle records the drinking habits of the users and sends them notifications
    about the time and amount of the water that they are supposed to drink to keep
    them healthy and hydrated. The app collects data about users such as their weight
    and age, plus other factors such as the current levels of temperature and humidity
    to estimate the amount of the needed water to keep them hydrated. When the user
    falls behind with hydration, an alert sounds, as well as a simple glance from
    the LEDs, will indicate when it’s time for the next drink. Canary [50] is an all-in-one
    home security system that comprises a set of sensors such as temperature, air
    quality, sound, motion vibration, in addition, an HD video camera in one unit.
    The system utilizes ML algorithms to let the users know what is happening at home
    and take action by sending notifications to your phone if something happens. Those
    ML models learn over time and send the users smarter notifications as it detects
    motion. So that, the longer you have the system, the more effective it becomes.
    Canary is able to decrease the rate of false alarms by learning the user behavior
    and the ambient noise level and the home temperature patterns. Amazon Echo [51]
    is a small cylinder enable the users to control anything in the home via the voice.
    Amazon Echo has a powerful voice recognition capability, the user does not have
    to worry about the complexities of their voice. Amazon Echo is connectable via
    Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, the users can send voice commands to control the speakers
    as well as other compatible devices such as Belkin’s WeMo and Philips Hue. It
    can also use Amazon cloud Lambda service to send commands. To send any command
    It requires to include the name of the program, for instance, “Alexa, turn on
    TV”. It also includes a network to distant servers, which slows down the response
    time. Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services [52] this device merges personal
    smart home automation with security monitoring task. It enables the occupants
    to control and monitor everything in the home from lighting and window shades
    systems to security cameras and smoke alarms. the user can utilize a smartphone
    app or desktop-mounted hardware console for controlling and monitoring. It can
    provide real-time alerts, GPS vehicle and asset tracking, video viewing, and mobile
    control. The system only supports Z-Wave devices, it needs to be installed by
    an authorized Honeywell dealer. It does not work with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats.
    In addition, the Honeywell provides security cameras and sensors, it also supports
    other smart devices from third parties, such as Yale locks and Lutron lighting.
    Table 4 shows a comparison among various smart control devices in the SBs. TABLE
    4 Comparison Among Various Smart Control Devices in SB C. Networking and Home
    Gateway An SB combines a communication network in order to control smart devices
    and services within the building. The communication network of a smart building
    can be based on diverse communication media such as twisted pair cable, as the
    traditional computer networks. The networking in building automation system has
    a tendency to utilize a heterogeneous network that is made up of diverse communication
    media and network standards. The building automation network is identified by
    physical technology and communication protocols. There is an internal network
    that connects devices inside the building, as well as the external networks, can
    be integrated separately. Public Internet, ISDN, and mobile phone networks are
    some examples of external networks [28], [53]. A typical SB may comprise a number
    of different components, such as sensors, actuators, communication and processing
    devices. Because of their nature, these components have limited capabilities and
    computational capacity in term of battery capacity and capability of data processing.
    To deal with this issue, most of the SB systems have been utilized as a central
    gateway to collect, process, and analyze context data from different sensors and
    actuators in the building. Several protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    and Z-wave can be utilized for communicating the gateway. The home gateway can
    also collect and store data for a specific time period. Typically, these gateways
    can connect to the cloud services and perform data processing and reasoning tasks.
    The centralized gateway usually does not have any interface. They can be controlled
    and managed utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers [54], [55]. In general,
    depending on the communication media used, SB network technology can be classified
    by interconnection method into three main types: Powerline, Busline, and Wireless
    [15], [56], which we describe next. 1) Powerline Communication (PLC) PLC method
    reuses the building electrical network; such that devices, appliances, and services
    are directly connected to the main power supply utilizing the already available
    electrical outlets in a building. The data is sent through the normal cable system
    to activate or deactivate the devices in the building. PLC system is historically
    the oldest technology in SB and is generally cheap but less reliable and scalable
    [3]. Originally, the application of PLC was mainly to secure the typical operation
    of the electric power supply system in case of failures or breakdowns through
    the direct exchange of information between the distribution center, and power
    plant. Therefore, this approach has become a competitive choice for SB networking,
    benefiting from availability, robustness, and ready connectivity of this method.
    Some of the protocols of this method offer a single-way communication, which enables
    the device to only receive information but not to communicate. There are different
    mainstream protocols of PLC method such as X-10, INSTEON, HomePlug, BACnet, and
    Lonworks. 2) Busline Busline systems in SBs networks use a separate physical media,
    usually twisted-pair cabling similar to the physical cables utilized for network
    services for transporting electrical signals. This type of systems is pleasant
    the building’s occupants, albeit the configuration process is complex, and it
    requires some knowledge of networking. Although the configuring complexity and
    installation cost of this system, the use of a separate cable could present a
    positive note about this approach, as it allows this method of networking to provide
    higher bandwidth, and to make it the most reliable of the three approaches. In
    addition, this technology usually supports a completed two-way communication protocol
    that enables the appliances to easily communicate with each other [57]. Some of
    the protocols in Busline technology are Konnex (KNX), CAN (Controller Area Network),
    Modbus, Meter-Bus (M-Bus). 3) Wireless Interconnection Many of the new SB applications
    use wireless technologies such as infrared and radio frequency, which are more
    convenient for users due to their untethered nature and the elimination of cables.
    The devices within the smart building can communicate wirelessly as radio wave
    can penetrate through floors, cabinets, and walls [56]. Because of the complexity
    and cost of potential modifications and of the re-wiring process in a smart building,
    several different wireless technologies are rising to produce flexible networking
    patterns convenient to occupants without taking to consider the physical wiring
    and deployment of such wire in the building. Typically, there are various protocols
    for the wireless system such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WLAN, Z-wave, RFID etc., which
    essentially work in the industrial scientific medical bands, particularly in the
    2.4GHz frequency range. These wireless technologies are usually related to some
    control network concept in an SB such as low power consumption, high cost-effectiveness,
    low speed, flexibility in networking, deployment as well as building coverage
    [3]. The gateway is the central server of an SB that is commonly used in IoT solutions.
    The services provided by the gateway essentially concern to system management
    functionalities such as monitoring, controlling, and configuring the systems and
    their devices. It also supports some processing and data storage capabilities
    required for complex applications. D. Software Platform For a building to be “smart,”
    it is important that all the appliances and systems in the building communicate
    and exchange data securely with each other as well as with smartphones, tablets,
    and servers in the cloud. Software platforms play a critical role in exchanging,
    archiving and disseminating information through different protocols. These platforms
    use push, pull, publish/subscribe, etc. The goal of the joint commercial enterprises
    is to develop an open source software platform in order to make the process of
    data exchanging easier between the devices of different manufacturers. Therefore,
    the users will not have to worry in the future about the compatibility issues
    when utilizing electric and electronic devices of different manufacturers at home.
    In addition, the new platform can also offer a variety of different building services
    such as entertainment, energy efficiency, and security technology. Hence, this
    will enable creating different apps for these areas of use [58]. ABB, Robert Bosch
    GmbH, and Cisco Systems Inc. established an open-software platform called Mozaiq
    Operations GmbH [59] to unify smart building technology and offer interoperability
    across for all devices and services in the building, to simplify the experience
    for residents. It will enable users to seamlessly and intuitively customize their
    appliances and devices, regardless of manufacturers and brands of these devices,
    in order to improve energy efficiency and achieve a unique level of control and
    comfort. For instance, the user can close the blinds in the home either by a click
    from a smartphone or through a pre-set instruction; and switch off automatically
    all screen devices for the children to go outside to play. In a smart building,
    many devices and appliances can simply and securely share information with one
    another and with smartphones and other smart devices; and the Internet in general.
    Indigo Domotics [60] is to implement the do-it-yourself smart building platform.
    Indigo home automation software controllers available for the Mac OS enables residents
    to combine an array of common INSTEON, Z-Wave and X10 devices for unparalleled
    control of your building lighting, sensors, thermostats, and appliances. With
    Indigo Touch (sold through iTunes app store, iOS only), users will easily achieve
    remote control of their appliances utilizing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. They
    also can use a web browser on any device to control their appliances virtually
    anywhere in the world. The users can receive texts or emails about specific events
    has been detected for doors opening/closing, power failures etc. Indigo, from
    Perceptive Automation, is the newest home automation software for the Mac. OpenHAB
    [61] is an open-source software platform that follows a middleware approach for
    integrating different technologies in smart building systems into a single solution.
    OpenHAB platform address a variety of network technologies and appliances in the
    area of a smart building. Currently, the dependency on a particular vendor becomes
    a problem due to the lack of a common language that bridges the different devices
    with building automation system. The main goal of the OpenHAB platform is to integrate
    the new devices and technologies in a smart building system through a community-based
    approach. OpenHAB utilizes an OSGi based modular system for communicating between
    different technologies and devices. Bindings can be developed and deployed as
    an OSGi bundle to bridge a particular technology and device. There are different
    supported technologies exist such as EnOcean, KNX, Z-Wave, and others are supported
    through special bindings [62]. SmartThings [47] this platform composed of hardware
    devices, sensors, and software applications. Context information is collected
    from the sensors, this context is contributed to the reasoning and action that
    are performed by the application. For instance, the sprinkler in the garden can
    detect the rain, and switch itself off accordingly to save water. SmartThings
    kit comprises sensors, smart devices, and hub. While the SmartThings application
    is configured to enable users to control and monitor their building environment
    through a smartphone device. The SmartThings Hub works to connect the sensors,
    devices and building’s internet router to one another and to the cloud. It is
    compatible with different communication protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and
    IP-accessible devices. In addition, the SmartThings is compatible with other sensors
    and devices such as thermostats, moisture sensors, motion sensors, presence sensors,
    locks and garage door openers [63]. HomeOS [64] is Microsoft’s home operating
    system platform, that can be installed on a personal computer. It is an open platform
    that is not limited to Windows-based devices [65], [66]. with HomeOS platform,
    applications can be installed to maintain various context-aware functionalities,
    for example, taking an image by a door camera and sending it to the occupant when
    someone rings the doorbell. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction that manages
    and extends the technology of network devices to the users and developers in the
    smart building environment. Its design enables the users to map their protocol-independent
    services to support the applications with simple APIs, a kernel, and protocols
    of specific devices. HomeOS usually runs on an allocated computer such as a home
    gateway, it does not need any adjustments to commodity devices. HomeOS usually
    utilizes (i) Datalog-based access control to facilitate the process of managing
    technology in the smart home (ii) a kernel to incorporate the devices and applications
    and (iii) protocol-independent services to allow the developers manageable access
    to the devices. Lab of Things (LoT) [67], [68] is an experimental research platform
    that utilizes connected devices in the buildings. LoT offers a framework that
    provides deployment capabilities such as remote monitoring and updating of system
    health, and logging data collected from different appliances in cloud storage.
    It enables data sharing and collecting, sharing codes, connect hardware sensors
    to the software platform, and participants using HomeOS. The platform is designed
    to make it simple to design solutions that can be deployed in IoT based smart
    services such as healthcare, energy management services as it works in combination
    with HomeOS. Eclipse Smarthome [69] is a framework that has a focus on heterogeneous
    environments such as smart building and ambient assisted living. This platform
    takes to consider a variety of existing communication mechanisms. Eclipse SmartHome
    works as an abstraction and translation framework that enables communications
    across system and protocol boundaries. It provides many relevant implemented extensions,
    protocols, and standards that are significant for smart building services. Those
    implementations can be of Java library or an OSGi bundle shapes so that they can
    be utilized independently from the rest of the project. The framework can work
    on different embedded devices such as a BeagleBone Black, an Intel Edison, or
    a Raspberry Pi. Extensions of Eclipse SmartHome are compatible with the solutions
    provided by different vendors. This means your code that is written for a specific
    purpose can be extended easily on commercial platforms. Eclipse SmartHome offers
    a variety of characteristics to allow you to design a special Smart Home solution
    for your expectations [70]. Apart from discussing various SB solutions, we will
    also highlight the popular simulator called Cooja is used widely by the research
    community to produce small simulations for relatively large wireless networks
    of embedding sensors and actuators; and connected devices, in order to develop,
    debug and evaluate systems based on the wireless sensor network technology. Cooja
    simulator is a Java-based wireless sensor network simulator. It is distributed
    with Contiki OS project. Cooja enables the emulation of the set of sensor nodes,
    in addition, it can simulate physical and application layers of the system [71].
    There are three basic properties for the simulated node in Cooja: Its hardware
    peripherals, node type, and data memory. The node type can be shared among multiple
    nodes and defines properties that are common to all these nodes [72]. Summary:
    The field of SBs contains a variety of technologies, across commercial, industrial,
    institutional and domestic buildings, including building controls and energy management
    systems. Several organizations and institutions are working to supply buildings
    with technology that enables the residents to adopt a single device to control
    all electronic devices and appliances. In this section, we discussed the various
    components for SBs including sensors and actuators, smart control devices, smart
    gateway, networking and software platforms. SECTION IV. Ml Background for SBS:
    Models, Tasks, and Tools Massive data generated from sensors, wearable devices,
    and other IoT technologies provide rich information about the context of users
    and building status and can be used to design SB management. This context information
    is needed to extract useful and interesting insights for various stakeholders.
    When the data volume is very high, developing predictive models using traditional
    approaches does not provide accurate insight and we require newly developed tools
    from big data. Big data is primed to make a big impact in SBs and is already playing
    a big role in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries
    [73], notably for waste analytics [74] and waste minimization [75]. ML is a powerful
    tool that facilitates the process of mining a massive amount of data that have
    been collected from different sources around us and make sense of a complicated
    world. ML algorithms apply a model on new data by learning the model from a set
    of observed data examples called a training set. For example, after being trained
    on a set of sample accelerometer data marked as walking or jogging, an ML algorithm
    can classify the future data points into walking and jogging classes. ML makes
    it relatively easy to develop advanced software systems without much involvement
    from the human side. They are applicable to many real-life problems in SB environments.
    One can also design and develop self-learning and collaborative systems. ML does
    not remove the human element from data science—it draws on computers’ strengths
    in handling big data to complement our understanding of semantics and context.
    It only needs training data to extract better features or parameters required
    to improve a given system. ML algorithms can be used to make predictions based
    on data patterns. It enables the computer to learn from the fed input data without
    being explicitly programmed so that ML algorithms can learn from and make predictions
    on input data [76], [77]. Nest thermostat is an example of a device that applies
    a specific temperature in a specific room and at a certain time of day according
    to the occupants’ preference. There are devices such as Amazon’s Echo that can
    learn from voice patterns, and the others those learn from much more complex behavior
    and activity patterns. A. Ml Models ML techniques have been widely used to develop
    smart systems which can sense and react according to context modifications in
    SBs [78]. There are many different ML algorithms, according to the two well-known
    theorems No Free Lunch theorem and Ugly Duckling theorem. No Free Lunch theorem
    states “there are no algorithms that can be said to be better than any other”,
    without prior information about the problem, any two algorithms may perform equally
    well in solving a problem. While Ugly Duckling theorem states “we cannot say that
    any two different patterns would be more similar to each other than any other
    pairs.” [79]. Mainly, ML is categorized into four categories handling different
    types of learning tasks as follows: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Figure 7 shows
    ML styles. These categories are described next and a summarized comparison between
    these ML techniques is presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparison of ML Techniques
    FIGURE 7. ML styles. Show All 1) Supervised Learning refers to developing algorithms
    based on a labeled training dataset, from which the learner should generalize
    a representation by building the system model that represents the relations between
    the input, output and system parameters. ML model is developed through a training
    process that continues on the input training data until the model reaches the
    desired level of accuracy [80], [81]. Some examples of common supervised ML algorithms
    are: naive Bayes model, decision tree, linear discriminant functions such as support
    vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models
    (HMMs), instance-based learning (such as k-nearest-neighbor learning), ensembles
    (bagging, boosting, random forest), logistic regression, genetic algorithms, and
    logistic regression [82], [83]. Supervised learning approaches are extensively
    used to solve different problems in smart buildings. Application in SBs: Boger
    et al. [76] proposed a supervised learning system using Markov decision processes
    to help people with dementia the process of hand washing. Altun et al. [84] make
    a comparative study on the supervised human activity classification approaches
    using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. Mozer [85] developed
    the occupant comfort control of the home environment system using neural networks
    and reinforcement learning to control air heating, lighting, ventilation, and
    water heating in the smart home environment. Bourobou et al. [86] presented a
    hybrid approach using ANN and K-pattern clustering to identify and predict user
    activities in the smart environments. Hsu et al. [87] proposed a TV recommendation
    system using a neural network model based on user personalized properties such
    as activities, interests, moods, experiences, and demographic information data.
    Fleury et al. [88] proposed a healthcare-focused smart home system using the SVM
    algorithm to classify daily living activities based on the data from the different
    sensors. Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into classification,
    regression, time series, and ensemble method problems. a: Classification The task
    of classification algorithms is to classify an instance into a specific discrete
    set of possible categories. Given two sets of data (labeled and unlabeled datasets),
    the labeled dataset is used for the training process, while the unlabeled dataset
    will be used to evaluate of the classification results. The normal process is
    to count the number of instances that are assigned to the right category, which
    is also known as the accuracy rate (AR) defined by [21]. The classification algorithm
    can mathematically be described as follows: AR= N c N t (1) View Source where
    N c denotes the number of test instances that are correctly assigned to their
    categories to which they belong; N t the number of test instances. The precision
    ( P ) and recall ( R ) are used to measure the details of the classification results.
    The four possible outcomes are true positive ( TP ), false negative ( FN ), false
    positive ( FP ), and true negative ( TN ), the precision ( P ) and recall ( R
    ) are generally defined as: P= TP TP+FP (2) View Source Given P and R , a simple
    method to describe the precision and recall of the overall classification results,
    called F-score or F-measure, is defined as: F= 2PR P+R (3) View Source Commonly
    used classification techniques include decision trees, SVM, rule-based induction,
    neural networks, deep learning, memory-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks
    [89]. b: Decision Tree Algorithms The decision tree method is an important predictive
    ML modeling approach, which constructs a model of decisions presented based on
    the actual values of features in the data. Decision trees can be utilized for
    both classification and regression problems. In tree structures, leaves represent
    class labels and branches represent conjunctions of attributes that drive to those
    labels [90]. The decision trees that the target variable takes continuous values
    called regression trees. Decision trees are often one of the favorites of ML algorithms
    because of its speed and accuracy. The most common algorithms for decision tree
    are [91]: classification and regression tree, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0, Chi-squared,
    M5, and conditional decision trees. Application in SBs: Delgado et al. [92] propose
    an ML technique based on decision trees to extract the most frequent activities
    of human behavior and the temporal relationship of those activities in order to
    produce the human behavior quickly in a smart environment. Viswanathan et al.
    [93] introduce a prototype distributed data mining system for healthcare environment
    using C4.5 classification algorithm that can provide the patient monitoring and
    health services. Decision trees algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that is
    easy to interpret and explain. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that
    it can easily overfit. c: Bayesian Algorithms Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’
    theorem for classification and regression problems. The most common Bayesian algorithms
    are [94]: Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian
    network. Application in SBs: Parnandi et al. [95] propose an indoor localization
    approach based on Naive Bayes classification and dynamic time warping, they exploit
    the embedded sensors of smartphones to determine the building that the user entered
    and the activities that the user is performing inside the building. Verbert et
    al. [96] proposed an ML approach based on Bayesian network to diagnosis the fault
    in HVAC systems. The model has been constructed based expert knowledge concerning
    conservation laws, component interdependencies, and historical data using virtual
    sensors. Naive Bayes classifier approaches have been applied with potential results
    for human activity recognition in [97], [98]. Naive Bayes approach recognizes
    human activities that identify with the highest probability to the set of sensor
    readings that were observed. d: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML
    algorithm which can be applied for both classification and regression problems
    though mostly used in classification challenges [140]. SVM is one of the most
    popularly utilized for many statistical learning problems, such as face and object
    recognition, text classification, spam detections, handwriting analysis etc. [141].
    is maximizing the margin that separating between the hyperplane of two classes’
    closest points. Support vectors are the points lying on the boundaries, and the
    optimal separating hyperplane is the middle of the margin [142]. Application in
    SBs: Fu et al. [105] proposed an SVM method to predict the system level electricity
    loads of public buildings that have electricity sub-metering systems. A real-time
    human tracker system proposed Nguyen et al. [106] using SVM for predicting and
    recognizing human motion based on the input images from a network of four cameras
    in the ubiquitous smart homes. Petersen et al. [107] developed an SVM model to
    predict the times where visitors are present in the home using only the data provided
    by wireless motion sensors in each room. Fleury et al. [88] presented a study
    for automatic recognition of daily living activities in a smart home based on
    SVM. They collected the data from various sensors such as Infra-Red Presence Sensors,
    door contacts, temperature and hygrometry sensor, and microphones. Das et al.
    [108] proposed a one-class classification approach for a real-time activity error
    detection in smart homes using one-class SVM. Zhao et al. [143] proposed an ML
    approach based on SVM and RNN to detect the occupancy behavior of a building through
    the temperature and heating source information for the energy efficiency consumption
    purposes. e: Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (ANNs) ANN models are inspired
    by the process of biological neural networks. ANN models are commonly utilized
    for regression and classification problems. The common ANN algorithms are [94]:
    Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Hopfield Network, and Radial Basis Function Network
    (RBFN). ANNs provide a number of advantages including it requires less statistical
    training, it has the capacity to detect complex nonlinear relationships between
    the predictor and response variables, as well as the ability to detect all possible
    relationships between predictor variables [104]. On the other hand, disadvantages
    include its “black box” nature, heavy computational burden and proneness to overfitting.
    However, due to the inherent features of neural networks, it has the following
    main limitations: challenge in training with no local optima, its accommodation
    to modifications in the behavior, the validation process of the results, and the
    complexity of network performance interpretation. Application in SBs: Badlani
    and Bhanot [99] developed a smart home system for energy efficiency applying pattern
    recognition based on ANNs, the system incorporates an RNN to capture human behavior
    patterns and an ANN for security applications in smart homes. Other researchers
    have applied ANNs to present context-aware services. Campo et al. [100] developed
    a system that calculates the probability of occupation for each section of the
    building and compares the probability with the current situation systematically.
    See [101] for a survey paper focusing on the role of ANNs for smart home services.
    Ermes et al. [102] proposed a hybrid classifier approach using a tree structure
    comprising a priori knowledge and ANN to recognize the activities such as rowing,
    biking, playing football, walking, running, sitting, or hiking. Ciabattoni et
    al. [103] proposed a home energy management system design using the neural network
    algorithm to predict the power production of the photovoltaic plant and the home
    consumptions during the given time. f: Deep Learning Algorithms: Deep learning
    methods represent an evolved form of ANNs in which a deep architecture (many layers
    comprising multiple linear and non-linear transformations [144]) is used. One
    of the promises of DL is replacing the manually selected features with efficient
    unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction
    algorithms. The most common DL algorithms are [145]: Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief
    Network (DBN), and Stacked Auto-Encoders. Deep learning has been used successfully
    in varieties of big data analytics applications, particularly natural language
    processing (NLP) applications, medical diagnosis, stock market trading, network
    security, and image identification. Deep learning is now ubiquitously used in
    major businesses and companies. Microsoft research on a deep learning system presented
    real-time speech translation system between Mandarin Chinese and English languages
    [146]. Apple’s Siri uses a deep learning trained model, and the voice recognition
    in the Google Android phone also uses a deep learning trained model [147]. DL
    utilizes a number of techniques such as drop-out and convolutions that enables
    the models to learn efficiently from high-dimensional data. However, DL requires
    much more data to train compared to other algorithms because of the magnitudes
    of parameters for estimation required by the models. Application in SBs: Choi
    et al. [114] propose two prediction algorithms deep belief network and restricted
    Boltzmann machines based on the DL framework for predicting different human activities
    in a building. They also presented a hybrid model which combines for predicting
    human behavior. The paper [115] proposes a generic deep learning framework based
    on convolutional and RNNs for human activity recognition that is suitable for
    multimodal wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or magnetic field
    sensors. Alsheikh et al. [116] proposed a hybrid approach of DL and hidden Markov
    model for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Baccouche
    et al. [117] propose a two-steps neural-based deep model to classify human activities,
    the first step of the model is automatically learned spatiotemporal features based
    on Convolutional Neural Networks. Then the second step of the model uses an RNN
    to classify the entire sequence of the learned features for each time-step. In
    [118], they propose an acceleration-based human activity recognition method using
    Convolution Neural Network. In [119] a deep convolutional neural network as the
    automatic feature extractor and classifier for recognizing human activities is
    proposed using the accelerometer and gyroscope on a smartphone. Hammerla et al.
    [148] explore the performance of deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches
    of deep learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors. For the
    sake of measuring the performance, the authors used three representative datasets
    that comprise motion data collected from wearable sensors. g: Hidden Markov Models
    (Hmm) An HMM is a doubly stochastic process with a hidden underlying stochastic
    process that can be observed through the sequence of observed symbols emitted
    by another stochastic process. Application in SBs: Wu et al. [113] proposed an
    improved HMM to predict user behaviors in order to provide services for people
    with disabilities. They developed a temporal state transition matrix to be utilized
    instead of the fixed state transition matrix. Lv and Nevatia [112] used hidden
    Markov models for both automatic recognition and segmentation of 3-D human activities
    to allow real-time evaluation and feedback for physical rehabilitation. Cheng
    et al. [110] proposed an inference engine based on the HMM that provides a comprehensive
    activity of daily living recognition capability. They integrated both Viterbi
    and Baum-Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. Chahuara
    et al. [111] proposed sequence-based models for online recognition of daily living
    activities in an SB environment. They presented three of sequence-based models:
    HMM, conditional random fields, and a sequential Markov logic network. h: Time
    Series Analysis A time series is a collection of temporal instances; time series
    data set usually have the following characteristics include the high dimensionality,
    large number of instances, and updating continuously [149]. One of the important
    purposes for time series representation is to reduce the dimension, and it divides
    into three categories: model-based representation, non-data-adaptive representation,
    and data-adaptive representation [150], [151]. Application in SBs: Survadevara
    et al. [125] proposed a wellness model using seasonal autoregression integration
    moving average time series with sleeping activity scenario in a smart home environment
    to forecast the elderly sleeping tendency. Zhou et al. [126] proposed a time series
    analysis framework to explore relationships among non-stationary time series in
    the case of data sensors in SBs. Jakkula and Cook [127] propose a time series
    based framework to determine temporal rules from observed physical and instrumental
    activities of occupants in a smart home. i: Regression The aim in regression problems
    is to estimate a real-valued target function. It is related to representing the
    relationship between variables that are repeatedly processed utilizing a measure
    of error in the predictions made by the model [152]. The most common regression
    algorithms are [153]: linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression,
    and ordinary least squares regression. Application in SBs: Chen et al. [120] used
    the regression technique of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to identify
    the physical and environmental parameters that providing the energy efficiency
    in an SB. Bouchard et al. [121] presented a gesture recognition system using linear
    regression combined with the correlation coefficient to recognize the gesture
    direction and estimate the segmentation of continuing gestures of daily usage
    activities in a smart environment. j: Ensemble Methods A combination of multiple
    classifiers often referred to as a classifier ensemble, group of classification
    models that are trained separately and the predictions of those models are then
    combined in a way to produce the overall prediction [154]. The most popular ensemble
    learning based classification techniques are [155]: random forest, boosting, gradient
    boosting machines, AdaBoost, bagging, and blending. Application in SBs: Jurek
    et al. [122] proposed a cluster-based ensemble approach solution for activity
    recognition within the application domain of smart homes. With this approach,
    activities are modeled as cluster collections built on different subsets of features.
    Fatima et al. [123] proposed an ensemble classifier method for activity recognition
    in smart homes using genetic algorithm optimization to merge the prediction output
    of multiple classifiers that make up the ensemble. They used the ANN, HMM, conditional
    random field, and SVM [13] as base classifiers for activity recognition. Guan
    and Ploetz [124] proposed a deep LSTM ensemble method for activity recognition
    using wearables: more specifically, the authors developed modified training procedures
    for LSTM networks and proposed the combination of sets of diverse LSTM learners
    into classifier collectives. 2) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning refers
    to developing algorithms that use data with no labels to analyze the behavior
    or the system being investigated [156]. Thus, the algorithm does not know about
    the truth of the outcome. In other words, the unsupervised learning algorithm
    classifies the sample sets to different clusters by investigating the similarity
    between the input samples. Clustering is done using different parameters taken
    from the data which enable us to identify correlations which are not so obvious.
    The inferring structures existing within the input data is used to prepare the
    model to prepare and extract general rules of the model. A mathematical process
    might be used to systematically reduce redundancy, or organize data by similarity
    [129]. The unsupervised approach has been applied to recognize various activities
    in smart buildings when it is challenging to have labels for input data [130].
    Common unsupervised learning problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction,
    and association rule learning. There are a variety of commonly used unsupervised
    learning algorithms, some of those algorithms are based on supervised-learning
    algorithms: the Apriori algorithm and k-Means. In unsupervised learning, usually
    there is no a measure for the output; we recognize only the features and the target
    is to define the patterns and relationships among a set of input measures [80].
    The major disadvantage of unsupervised learning is the absence of direction for
    the learning algorithm, hence, there might not be any useful detected knowledge
    in the selected set of attributes for the training. Clustering is a method of
    unsupervised learning that involves detecting patterns in the data by placing
    each data element into a group of K-clusters, where each group holds data elements
    most similar to each other [157]. Unsupervised learning problems can be categorized
    into clustering and association problems, which are described next. a: Clustering
    A clustering problem explores the internal groupings in the input data, such as
    grouping customers by their purchasing habits. Clustering techniques are usually
    organized by modeling strategies such as centroid-based and hierarchical. All
    methods are concerned with handling the internal structures in the input data
    to properly organize the data into groups of maximum commonality [158]. The quality
    of the clustering result is evaluated depends on the type of application that
    utilizes a clustering algorithm. For example, the sum of squared errors is generally
    utilized for data clustering while the peak-signal-to-noise ratio is used for
    image clustering [21]. The most common clustering algorithms are [153]: k-Means,
    k-Medians, expectation maximization, and hierarchical clustering. Application
    in SBs: Fahad et al. [128] propose an activity recognition approach that combines
    the classification with the clustering, in their approach the activity instances
    are clustered using Lloyd’s clustering algorithm. Then, they apply evidence theoretic
    K-Nearest neighbors learning method that combines KNN with the Dampster Shafer
    theory of evidence. The paper [86] proposes a hybrid approach to recognize and
    predict user activities in a smart environment. They use the K-pattern clustering
    algorithm to classify so varied and complex user activities, and ANN to recognize
    and predict users’ activities inside their personal rooms. Lapalu et al. [82]
    used an unsupervised learning approach to address the issues of daily living activities’
    learning in smart home. They utilize the Flocking algorithm for clustering analysis
    of a use case in cognitive assistance service that assists the people suffering
    from some type of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aicha et al. [83] present
    an unsupervised learning approach for detecting abnormal visits of an elderly
    in a smart home environment based on a Markov modulated Poisson process model.
    The model combines multiple data streams, such as in the front-door sensor transitions
    and the general sensor transitions. The other cases of social communication services,
    Rashidi and Cook [129] applied an unsupervised learning approach to detect social
    interaction and monitor activity daily living in a smart space, their approach
    can adapt and update automatically to reflect the changes in discovered patterns
    from implicit and explicit identified feedbacks of the occupant. Rashidi et al.
    [130] introduce an unsupervised method that identifies and tracks the normal activities
    that commonly occur in an individual’s routine in a smart environment. The activity
    discovery method of the system is produced to cluster the sequences based on the
    simple k-means algorithm. Fiorini et al. [159] proposed an unsupervised ML approach
    to identify the behavioral patterns of the occupants using unannotated data collected
    from low-level sensors in an SB. Their approach involves processing and analyzing
    collected data related to the daily living activities of 17 older adults living
    in a community-based home supplied with a variety of sensors. They extract activity
    information from collected data at different times of the day. b: Association
    The association rule learning problem is utilized to identify the rules that define
    large portions of input data, such as people that buy X item also tend to buy
    Y item. Association analysis is performed on rules discovered by analyzing input
    data for frequent if/then statement and using the criteria of support and confidence
    to discover relationships between unrelated data in a relational database or another
    information repository. Here “support” indicates how frequently the items appear
    in the database while “confidence” indicates the number of times the if/then statements
    have been found to be true. Many algorithms for generating association rules have
    been proposed. Apriori algorithm is the most well-known association algorithm
    [160]. Application in SBs: Aztiria et al. [161] proposed system that learns the
    frequent patterns of human behavior using association, workflow mining, clustering,
    and classification techniques. The core part of the system is the learning layer
    which is made up of two modules: the language module, which provides a standard
    conceptualization of the patterns; and the algorithm module, which discovers the
    patterns. Kang et al. [162] proposed a service scenario generation scheme for
    interpreting association rules extracted from the states of all devices in SB
    environments. Typically, These states are collected periodically at a specific
    time interval from the devices. Nazerfard et al. [163] propose a framework to
    discover the temporal features of the activities, including the temporal sequencing
    of activities and their start time and duration using the temporal association
    rule techniques in a smart home. 3) Semi-Supervised Learning Semi-Supervised learning
    lies between supervised and unsupervised methods. Input data is a composite of
    labeled and unlabeled samples. These hybrid algorithms aim to inherit the strengths
    of the main categories while mitigating their weaknesses. The model learns the
    patterns present in the data and also make predictions. Example problems are classification
    and regression [164]. There are some common semi-supervised learning models, including
    generative models, heuristic approaches, semi-supervised SVM, graph-based methods,
    self-training, help-training, mixture models, co-training and multi-view learning
    [94]. Application in SBs: Cook [131] combined fully-supervised and semi-supervised
    learning to recognize and follow activities that support health monitoring and
    assistance context-aware services for people experiencing difficulties living
    individually at smart homes. Liu et al. [132] proposed a vision based semi-supervised
    learning approach for fall detection and recognizing other activity daily living
    in smart environments to overcome the labeling challenges of human activities
    by systematic interpreting the activities with the highest confidence. Fahmi et
    al. [133] proposed a semi-supervised fall detection approach in which a supervised
    algorithm utilizing decision trees in the training process and then profiles are
    used to implement a semi-supervised algorithm based on multiple thresholds. Radu
    et al. [134] present semi-supervised ML method using only the low power sensors
    on a smartphone to consider the problem of determining whether a user is indoors
    or outdoors. Guan et al. [135] propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm for
    activity recognition named En-Co-training to make use of the available unlabeled
    samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number
    of labeled samples. The proposed algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by
    using an ensemble method. 4) Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is
    a learning approach to control a system in order to maximize performance measure
    that represents a long-term objective [165]. Reinforcement learning, an area of
    ML inspired by behaviorist psychology, is concerned with the way that software
    agents have to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the concept
    of cumulative reward. RL algorithms learn control policies, particularly when
    there is no a priori knowledge and there is a massive amount of training data.
    However, RL algorithms suffer from some drawback such as the high computational
    cost required to find the optimal solution, such that all states need to be visited
    to choose the optimal one. The well-known approaches of RL are Brute force, Monte
    Carlo methods, Temporal difference methods, and Value function [166]. Q-learning
    [167] is a model-free reinforcement learning approach based on learning the required
    utility given a state decision. Application in SBs: Mozer [136] applied Q-learning
    for lighting regulation to predict the time of turning the lights ON/OFF in a
    building. This prediction model can be utilized to schedule the lights’ activations
    in a building for efficient energy consumption proposes. Li and Jayaweera [137]
    proposed a Q-learning based approximate dynamic programming algorithm to provide
    a more efficient, flexible and adaptive method. This approach can enable customers
    to make an optimal on-line decision making in SB environment to maximize the profits
    based on both local fully observable and the estimated hidden information of the
    building. Khalili and Aghajan [138] proposed a temporal differential class of
    RL method for autonomous learning of a user’s preference of music and lighting
    service settings in presence of different states of the user in SB environment.
    The preferences are learned by the model by using the explicit or implicit feedback
    from users when they react to the provided service. Xu et al. [139] give a survey
    of developments in RL algorithms with function approximation. They evaluated and
    compared different RL algorithms using several benchmark learning, prediction,
    and learning control tasks. B. ML Tasks for SBS In this section, we will describe
    the major ML tasks that are relevant to SB. The reader is referred to Figure 8
    for a general depiction of ML tasks in SBs and the steps taken to implement ML
    in an SB environment. FIGURE 8. ML tasks in SB environment. Show All 1) Data Collection
    and Acquisition A variety of data collection approaches are used, each of which
    has different deals in terms of capabilities, energy efficiency, and connectivity.
    Sensors and similar objects in SBs produce raw data simultaneously in an automated
    way and such devices may store the data for a specific period of time or report
    it to controlled components [168]. Data can be collected at gateways; the collected
    data is then filtered and processed, fused into compact forms for efficient transmission.
    A variety of communication technologies such as Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular are
    utilized to transfer data to collection points. Data collected from a global-scale
    deployment of smart things defines the basis for decision making and providing
    services. It is possible that the decisions are unreliable when the quality of
    utilized data is poor [169]. Zhao et al. [170] propose a data acquisition and
    transmission system which could be used for monitoring systems to collect energy
    consumption data (e.g., electricity, water, gas, heating, etc.) from terminal
    meters which are installed in buildings. The system stores the data periodically
    after analyzing and processing it and finally transmits the data to servers through
    the Ethernet. Rowley et al. [171] propose the data acquisition and modeling approaches
    that can support the delivery of building energy infrastructure in both new building
    and renovated real-world contexts. Such methods provide a means to achieve short,
    medium and long-term forecasting of possible scenario pathways to multi-objective
    sustainable outcomes. CLEEN MMEA [172] platform that collects, processes, and
    manages the data and initiates contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose is
    to establish an online marketplace to collect data and provide services for different
    companies. The interfaces are made public so that any company can easily join
    the network to buy or sell services. The analysis results can be given to an energy
    services company in order to allow offering the service to the owners. A typical
    example of open access data collection system is e3Portal [173] developed by VTT
    in collaboration with Finnish municipalities. e3Portal offers information and
    tools when planning savings measures and energy retrofitting in municipal buildings.
    It also involves frequently updated data regarding energy and water consumption
    in thousands of public buildings like schools, kindergartens, offices, hospitals,
    other health care facilities, etc. Decision makers, designers, operation and maintenance
    personnel, as well as buildings users, can utilize it. There are projects that
    provide publicly available SB datasets for researchers to conduct further studies;
    A list of “Home Datasets” [174] includes the datasets collected by projects from
    UC Berkeley, MIT, Washington State University, University of Amsterdam, University
    of Edinburgh, and the University of Tokyo. The WARD [175] project supported by
    NSF TRUST Center at UC Berkeley provides a benchmark dataset for human action
    recognition using a wearable motion sensor network. The dataset was collected
    from 13 repetitive actions by 13 male and 7 female participants between the ages
    of 19 and 75. An MIT project [176] collected daily live activities dataset from
    two single-person apartments within a period of two weeks. Eighty-four sensors
    to record opening-closing events were attached to different appliances and devices
    such as drawers, refrigerators, containers, etc. Banos et al. [177] introduced
    an open benchmark dataset collected from various inertial sensors attached to
    different parts of the body. They considered 33 fitness activities, recorded using
    9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. The CASAS project [178] at Washington
    State University provides a publicly-available dataset for a three-bedroom apartment
    with one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Different types of motion and
    digital sensors are installed to support temperature readings, in addition, the
    analog sensors are installed to support readings for hot water, cold water, and
    stove burner use [179]. The PlaceLab project [180] of MIT provides a dataset collected
    from a one-bedroom apartment with more than 900 sensors, including those coming
    from motion, switch and RFID sensors. That is being used to monitor activity in
    the environment in the context of a smart home [181]. A collection of smart meters
    data from five houses in the UK [182] That consists of 400 million instances.
    The active power is formed by different appliances and the whole-house power demand
    every 6 seconds. The major challenges that arise for data collection are scalability,
    privacy, security, and heterogeneity of resources [183]. Automated sensor data
    collection process collects a large amount of data that overwhelms the collection
    and analysis centers in comparison to the data collected from other sources such
    as IoT devices and social media. This leads to a huge number of small synchronous
    write operations to the database storage system, consequently, resulting in serious
    performance bottlenecks to the storage system design [184]. Because of the extensive
    use of RFID technology, privacy issues arise in data collection; for example,
    the RFID tags carried by a person may become a unique identifier for that person.
    Also, other security concerns appear, for example, the radio signals of RFID technology
    are easily jammed. Hence, that can disrupt the data collection process [185].
    The heterogeneity of data that is being collected from different resources is
    another major challenge, such that the data are usually very noisy, large-scale,
    and distributed. This makes it very difficult to use the collected data effectively
    without a clear description of existing data processing techniques [184]. 2) Data
    Preprocessing A large amount of data are generated by sensors in SBs; this data
    comes from various sources with diverse formats and structures. Usually, this
    data is not ready for analysis as it might be incomplete or redundant due to low
    battery power, poor calibration, exposure to various malicious elements and interference.
    Therefore, raw data typically needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing data,
    discard noisy and redundant data and integrate data from various sources into
    an integrated schema before being committed to storage. This preprocessing is
    called data cleaning. The quality of data can be improved substantially by applying
    some cleaning techniques to the data before it arrives its end user [168], [186].
    Data cleaning is one of the significant tasks in the data processing phase. Data
    cleaning is not a new process particular for the IoT data processing. It has already
    been applied as a process for database management systems. Presenting a data cleaning
    method would further aid the applications to focus on their core logic without
    worrying about data reliability post-processing overheads [184]. There are many
    different techniques that have been utilized to deal with the problem of cleaning
    noisy data streams such as Kalman filters [187], statistical models [186] and
    outlier detection models [184]. One of the major challenges with data cleaning
    techniques in the SBs is the heterogeneity of data collected from different sources
    particularly WSN- and RFID-enabled data streams. The utilized data cleaning techniques
    should be able to deal with several different variables of interest to satisfy
    IoT applications’ requirements, for example, setting home temperature based on
    observed outer temperature, user habits, energy management, etc. [169] Any type
    of failures such as a failed sensor, network issues, camera failure, or database
    crashes in the process of collecting data would invalidate the data. Consequently,
    this type of impediment will dramatically increase the time required to collect
    data [179]. 3) Dimensionality Reduction There are huge volumes of raw data that
    are captured from heterogeneous and ubiquitous of sensors used in SBs. Most of
    the data collected from those sensors are redundant and they need to be brought
    down to a smaller number of features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques
    without losing significant information [188]. The main idea from the dimensionality
    reduction strategy is to find a new coordinate system in which the input data
    can be represented with much fewer features without losing significant information.
    The dimensionality reduction can be made in two different ways: by extracting
    of the features that represent the significant data characteristics (this technique
    is called feature extraction), or by only selecting the most relevant features
    from the original dataset, this method is called feature selection [189], [190].
    Like clustering methods, the dimensionality reduction approach explores and exploits
    the internal structure of the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner
    using less information. Most of these techniques can be utilized in classification
    and regression problems. Examples of some salient algorithms are [153]: Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA). Chen et al. [191] propose a framework using the classification
    information of local geometry of data to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
    on human activity recognition from wearable, object, and ambient sensors. a: Feature
    Extraction The main components of the original data are the features. After extracting
    the features from the raw dataset, such features contain important information
    that is used by the learning algorithms for the activities discrimination. The
    most common methods of feature extraction work in time, frequency, and discrete
    domains [192]. Among time domain method, mean and standard deviation are the key
    approaches for almost all sensor types. While the frequency domain method focuses
    on the periodic structure of the collected data. Wavelet Transformation and Fourier
    Transform are the most common approaches. And discrete domain methods such as
    Euclidean-based distances, dynamic time warping, and Levenshtein edit distance
    are key approaches implemented in several applications such to string similarity,
    classifying human activities and modeling human behavioral patterns [16], [193].
    b: Feature Selection The main role of feature selection is to discriminate the
    most related subset of features within a high dimensional vector of features,
    so that reduces the load of noise and computational expense on the learning models.
    In order to map the high dimensional vector of features into a lower dimensional
    vector, there are several common algorithms used such as Linear Discriminant Analysis
    (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis
    (ICA) [194]. Hausmann and Ziekow [195] proposed an approach for automatically
    adapting the feature selection for SBs application ML models from the time-series
    data based on wrapper methods and genetic optimization. Fahad et al. [196] propose
    an activity recognition approach for overlapping activities using K-Nearest neighbors
    approach that distinguishes the most important features from the collected information
    obtained from deployed sensors in multiple locations and objects. Fang et al.
    [197] determine that the different feature sets generate different levels of accuracy
    for recognizing human activities, and selecting inappropriate datasets increases
    the level of computational complexity and decreases the level of prediction accuracy
    in smart home environments. The wrapper and filtering are the two main statistical
    methods of feature selection problem. It is argued that although the wrapper approach
    may obtain better performances, filters are less resource intensive and faster
    [198]. In [199], different feature selection methods are utilized for the process
    of dimensionality reduction of the learning problem to recognize the human activities
    from observed sensors. The authors show that the performance of the learning models
    to recognize the human activity has a strong relationship with the utilized features.
    c: Feature Projection feature projection can be represented as a mapping from
    the original set of features to an appropriate set that optimizes the learning
    criterion, such that the feature projection approach allows the process of visualizing
    and mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to low dimensional one, in addition,
    it enables analyzing the distribution of the reduced feature vectors [200]. Consequently,
    the feature projection approach reduces the pattern recognition’s processing time
    and enables selecting the best-performed classifier for the reduced feature vectors.
    Hence, it makes real-time implementation possible [198]. Chu et al. [201] proposed
    a linear supervised feature projection that utilizes the LDA algorithm for EMG
    pattern recognition that attempted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion. C.
    ML Tools & Platforms for SBs There are a variety of existing ML platforms and
    tools to support the learning process. With the current increasing number of those
    kinds of toolkits, the task of selecting the right tool for processing big data
    streaming from various sources can still be difficult. Typically, there is no
    single toolkit that truly fits and provides solutions for all different problems.
    Many of the available toolkits might have overlapping uses, and each has advantages
    and disadvantages. Most of those toolkits might require experiences in the domains
    of programming languages and system architecture. In addition, usually many people
    lack a full understanding of the capabilities and how to use those available platforms
    [202]. The important factors that must be considered when selecting a specific
    ML tool are scalability, speed, coverage, usability, extensibility, and programming
    languages support. With respect to the scalability factor, the size and complexity
    of the data should be considered to determine if a specific toolkit will be fit.
    The processing platform that the library is running on and the complexity of the
    algorithm affect the speed factor. Not all the projects prioritize the speed factor;
    if the models require frequent updates, the speed may be a crucial concern; but
    not otherwise. Coverage represents the number of ML algorithms implemented in
    the tool. With the massive amount of data capturing from heterogeneous sources,
    ML community faces the challenges of how the ML model can efficiently process
    and learn from the big data. In general, the available big data tools do not implement
    all varieties of different classes of ML algorithms, and typically their coverage
    ranges from a few algorithms to around two dozen. The usability factor includes
    elements such as initial setup processing; continuous maintenance; the available
    programming languages and user interface available; the amount of documentation,
    or availability of a knowledgeable user. The extensibility factor means that the
    implementations introduced in the tools can be utilized as building blocks towards
    new systems. It is necessary to evaluate tools in terms of how well they are able
    to meet this factor. There are a variety of ML libraries that are available in
    different programming languages. Depending on the task you are trying to accomplish,
    certain languages, libraries, and tools can be more effective than others. The
    following provides a detailed observation of the strengths and weaknesses of the
    top used deep learning and ML tools. The reader is also referred to Table 6 for
    a concise tabulated summary of the described deep learning and ML tools. TABLE

    2015 under an Apache 2.0 open source license. TensorFlow has tools that support
    deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms. TensorFlow implements
    data flow graphs, where “tensors” are batches of data that can be processed by
    a set of algorithms defined by a graph. The movements of the data through the
    system are called “flows”—hence, the name. TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs
    and GPUs. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X desktop, and server systems, and Windows
    support on roadmap, as well as on Android and Apple’s iOS mobile computing platforms.
    TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run
    fast. TensorFlow utilizes a symbolic graph of vector operations method, in order
    to easily define a new network. However, TensorFlow has a weakness that is related
    to modeling flexibility. Such that each computational flow has to be constructed
    as a static graph. That makes some computations such as beam search difficult.
    4) Torch Torch [206] is an open source ML computing framework that supports a

    need to have real-time data analysis for stream data and waiting for the information
    to be archived and then analyzed is not practical for these type of applications.
    Generally, Stream processing is intended to analyze a massive amount of data and
    act on real-time streaming data utilizing continuous queries such as SQL-type
    queries to handle streaming data in real-time utilizing scalable, available and
    fault-tolerant architecture. Essential to stream processing is Streaming Analytics.
    More and more tools offer the possibility of real-time streaming data. The following

    Facebook, bank transfers etc.). Some of the specific applications of Storm include
    customer service management in real-time, operational dashboards, data monetization,
    cybersecurity analytics, and threat detection. 2) Apache Kafka Kafka [228] is
    a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant and durable open-source message broker project
    that originally developed by LinkedIn, and subsequently open sourced in early
    2011 and released by Apache Software Foundation on 23 October 2012. Kafka is written
    in Scala. It supports a variety of use case scenarios with a focus on high throughput,
    reliability, and scalability characteristics. For example, it can message sensor
    data from heating and cooling equipment in office buildings. 3) Oracle In 2013,
    Oracle started utilizing Oracle Enterprise Manager that includes Oracle Big Data
    Appliance to manage all of its big-data technologies. Oracle has also produced
    multiple low-latency technologies for Oracle Fast Data components includes Oracle
    Event Processing, Coherence, NoSQL, Business Analytics, and Real-Time Decisions.
    Oracle Event Processing provides solutions for building applications to filter,
    correlate and process events in real-time. It supports IoT services by delivering
    actionable insight on data streaming from a variety of data sources in real-time
    [229]. Oracle Stream Explorer (OSX) and Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) aim to support
    equipment monitoring applications for the systems that made of a variety of components
    through sensors, anomaly detection and failure prediction of such systems. ORE

    management platform with self-learning that determines optimized recommendations
    and actions with messaging, imagery, products, and services within business processes.
    4) Amazon Kinesis Streams Amazon Kinesis [233] is a platform for collecting and
    processing large streams of data on AWS in real-time, AWS launched Kinesis in
    November of 2013, offering powerful services for loading and analyzing streaming
    data, in addition, it provides custom streaming data applications for specialized
    needs. Sometimes Terabytes of data per hour can be generated - that need to be
    collected, stored, and processed continuously from various application services
    such as web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors etc. Typically,
    Amazon Kinesis Streams application can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library and
    reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can
    run on Amazon EC2 instances. 5) Apache Spark Streaming Apache Spark [234] is an
    open-source platform for real-time data processing, it can implement using four
    different languages: Scala, the syntax in which the platform is written; Python;
    R; and Java. Spark Streaming is an extension of core Spark API. It allows building
    fault-tolerant processing of real-time data streams. Spark Streaming allows the
    processing of millions of data among the clusters, and Spark SQL which makes it
    easier to exploit the data through the SQL language. Spark Streaming divides the
    live data stream into a predefined interval of batches, then handles each batch
    of data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then we can apply operations
    like map, reduce, join, window etc. to process these RDDs. The last results of
    these operations are then returned in batches. Spark Streaming can be utilized
    for a variety of application such as real-time monitoring and analyzing of application
    server logs. These logs messages are considered time series data. Examples of
    such type of data are sensor data, weather information, and clickstream data.
    This data can also be utilized for predicting future states based on historical
    data. Apache assures a computation speed that performs the operations quicker
    by 100 times than what is currently offered by Hadoop MapReduce in memory, and
    10 times better than in disc. Spark can be executed either in independent cluster
    mode or in the cloud on different frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Mesos, and

    messages and pretty much any data source possible into the HDFS. The architecture
    of Flume is simple and flexible, it is also robust and fault tolerant with tunable
    reliability mechanisms for failover and recovery. log manufacturing operations
    is an example of Flume’s application. The a massive log file data can stream through
    Flume. The log file data can be stored in HDFS and analyzed by utilizing Apache
    Hive. 7) Apache Samoa SAMOA [243] is a distributed streaming ML framework that
    contains programming abstractions for distributed streaming ML algorithms. Its
    name stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis and was originally developed
    at Yahoo! Labs in Barcelona in 2013 and has been part of the Apache incubator
    since late 2014. SAMOA is both a platform and a library. It enables the algorithm
    developer to reuse their code to run on different underlying execution engine.
    In addition, it supports plug-in modules to port SAMOA to different engines. By
    utilizing SAMOA, the ML algorithm developer does not need to worry about the complexity
    of underlying distributed stream processing engines. They can run it locally or
    utilizing one of stream processing engines, such as Storm, S4, or Samza. SAMOA
    provides the ML algorithms for a variety of tasks including classification, regression,
    clustering, along with boosting, and bagging for ensemble learning. Additionally,
    it offers a platform for the implementation of these ML algorithms, as well as
    a framework that enables the user to write their own distributed streaming algorithms.
    For example, there is CluStream for clustering, as well as Vertical Hoeffding
    Tree, which uses vertical parallelism on top of the decision tree, or Hoeffding
    tree for classification. There is also Adaptive Model Rules Regressor, which uses
    both vertical and horizontal parallelism implementations for regression [244].

    in Table 7. TABLE 7 Comparison Between Real-Time Data Analytics Tools TABLE 8
    Categorized Applications of SB SECTION V. Applications of Ml-Based Context-Aware
    Systems for SBs The potential uses of ML in an SB environment can be divided into
    four categories: detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization [79]. We
    discuss these categories separately next. In general, detection is the extraction
    of particular information from a larger stream of information. Many detection
    applications in SBs such as fire detection, leak detection, and anomaly detection
    [245]. Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity
    recognition in SBs; examples include fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall
    detection. [246]. The goal of recognition is to classify an object or an event
    to a predefined category. It focuses on how to make computer programs perform
    intelligent and human-like tasks, such as the recognition of an object from an
    image. The goal of prediction is to determine the temporal relations’ model between
    specific events to predict what will happen in the near future. Prediction can
    be either for classification or regression problems [247]. Event prediction when
    the goal is to predict the most probable event or subsequent activity is an example
    of classification problems, while latency prediction when the output takes on
    continuous values is an example of the regression problem. The general steps of
    applying ML processes to predict an event in an SB environment is shown in Figure
    9. FIGURE 9. Steps involved in applying ML models in an SB environment. Show All
    The goal of optimization, on the other hand, is to maximize the long-term profits
    by making proper decisions in different situations. reinforcement learning can
    be utilized with these problems. Some optimization problems can be managed as
    prediction problems such that the profits for different actions are predicted
    and the action with the highest profit would be selected. Decision making is the
    most common case of the optimization problem. It takes to consider a variety of
    variables and solving deals between the profits of different locations of the
    environment [248]. Smart buildings are becoming increasingly supplied with a variety
    of sensors that measure different parameters, and data from these sensors is analyzed
    by ML algorithms and used for a range of services and applications for the activities
    of the building occupants. SBs go far beyond saving energy and contributing to
    sustainability goals. The application and services provided by the SBs can be
    both residential and commercial ranging from e-health, e-marketing, intelligent
    car parking system, intelligent transportation system, automation, and logistics
    services. Figure 10 shows the taxonomy of basic domains of SB services. Lighting
    services are associated with the well-being of occupants depending on their activities
    in SBs that have sensors to conserve energy when lights are not needed. The power
    and electrical system may have onsite renewable energy sources to provide a percentage
    of power consumption in SBs. Waste management is related to the activities and
    actions required to collect, separate, transport, together with monitoring and
    regulation of waste management system in SBs. The security is related to managing
    automated locks, biometric devices as well as video surveillance systems in SBs.
    The communications center is related to connecting sensors and actuators in the
    building as well as the operations control center. The operations control center
    supports system analytics and decision making for the operations. Visual interfaces
    provide a dashboard that shows the status of SB services and human operators to
    better manage the building resources. These interfaces also allow the occupants
    to set up their optimal parameters for comfort and productivity improvement on
    daily activities. HVAC stands for the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning
    system, intended for the convenience of occupants that have effective interaction
    with the environment. Parking services aim to minimize the area and volume required
    for parking cars. It could support car sharing, electric vehicles and a place
    for bicycles as well. Finally, the water management services aim to increase savings
    and manage water reclamation for flushing, landscaping and air-cooling systems.
    FIGURE 10. SB services taxonomy. Show All Based on our literature survey, we have
    identified that the application areas of SBs can be elderly care, comfort/entertainment,
    security/safety, energy management, and other projects. In the rest of the section,
    we will briefly describe the major domains in providing the following SB services:
    (1) care of the elderly population; (2) enhancing energy efficiency; (3) enhancing
    comfort or providing entertainment; (4) enhancing safety and security; and (5)
    miscellaneous projects. a: Elderly Population’s Home Care SB technology such as
    sensors, voice activation, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity via mobile phones,
    smartphone monitoring apps and sophisticated computers can be especially useful
    for elderly or disabled individuals who live independently. Elderly persons can
    take the advantages of such technologies (e.g., monitoring system, emergency system,
    dangerous kitchen appliance detection, fall detection), to maintain a safe and
    healthy lifestyle while living independently [56], [249]. Smart technology in
    the SBs aims to collect real-time information on human daily activity and then
    learn of their personal patterns. ML techniques have the potential for a very
    wide array of new innovations in healthcare that will be transformative for both
    providers and their patients. Whenever a deviation from the norm patterns is detected,
    SB systems send the alerts to family members and the caregivers in order for them
    to take urgent response action. By using big data analytics and ML algorithms
    it is possible to analyze large-scale data contained in electronic medical records—e.g.,
    to learn automatically how physicians treat patients including the drugs they
    prescribe [250]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Chernbumroong
    et al. [56] proposed an activity recognition and classification approach for detecting
    daily living activities of the elderly people applying SVM. They used wrist-worn
    multi-sensors namely accelerometer, temperature sensor and altimeter for detection
    basic five activities namely feeding, grooming, dressing, mobility, and stairs.
    And other instrumental activities such as washing dishes, ironing, sweeping and
    watching TV. Taleb et al. [251] proposed a middleware-level solution that integrates
    both the sensing and the monitoring services for assisting elders at smart homes
    environment. The appliances used in the proposed framework include RFID readers
    that cover of the whole building, sound sensors, video cameras, smart door lock,
    microphone and speakers for interaction with the system. CAALYX [252] is a European
    Commission-funded project that supports older people’s autonomy and self-confidence.
    The service is formed of three distinct subsystems including elderly monitoring
    subsystem, home monitoring subsystem and the caretaker’s monitoring subsystem.
    The system delivers a high priority message to an emergency service including
    the geographic position and clinical condition of the elder user. EasyLine+ [253]
    project funded by the European Commission to support elderly people with or without
    disabilities in carrying out a longer independent life at home. The system uses
    a neural network, assistive software, and a variety of sensors such as illumination
    sensor, temperature sensor, door sensors, and RFID giving the capacity of controlling
    the white goods. Hossain et al. [254] proposed a cloud-based cyber-physical multi-sensory
    smart home framework for elderly people that supports gesture-based appliance
    control. Suryadevara et al. [255] proposed a model for generating sensor activity
    pattern and predicting the behavior of an elderly person using household appliances.
    b: Energy Efficiency When temperatures rise or fall in various zones of your home,
    heaters, air conditioners, fans, and other devices will turn on or off (or increase
    or decrease in speed or temperature). In order to perform an efficient energy
    consumption of the supply systems, a significant step that is necessary by analyzing
    the way that current energy consuming system is using in buildings [256]. In the
    last decade, analysis of the energy efficiency in the smart spaces has received
    increasing attention. Various approaches for energy efficiency have been proposed
    utilizing predictive modeling based on profile, climate data, and building characteristics
    [32], [257]. For instance, lights throughout your home might turn on and off depending
    on the time of day. In the past, various attempts have been made to improve energy
    efficiency in the SBs through the use of smart metering and sensor networks at
    the residential level facilities. It is a fact that these types of infrastructure
    are becoming more widespread but due to their variety and size, they cannot be
    directly utilized to make conclusions that help to improve the energy efficiency.
    ML approaches will be the key to the handling of energy efficiency problem in
    SBs. Learning about the occupants’ consumption habits is capable of generating
    collaborative consumption predictions that help the occupant to consume better
    [258]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Reinisch et al.
    [259] developed an optimized application of AI system for SB environment. The
    system focuses on some capabilities like ubiquity, context awareness, conflict
    resolution, and self-learning features. The system operates on a knowledge base
    that stores all the information needed to fulfill the goals of energy efficiency
    and user comfort. Jahn et al. [260] proposed an energy efficiency features system
    built on top of a Hydra middleware framework [261]. The system provides both,
    stationary and mobile user interfaces for monitoring and controlling a smart environment.
    Pan et al. [262] proposed an IoT framework that uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing
    technologies to improve the energy efficiency in SBs. They built an experimental
    testbed for energy consumption data analysis. Fensel et al. [263] proposed the
    SESAME-S project (SEmantic SmArt Metering - Services for energy efficient houses).
    The project focuses on designing and evaluating the energy efficiency services
    to enable the end-consumers in making the right decisions and controlling their
    energy consumption. The system combines a variety of smart building components,
    such as smart meters, a variety of sensors, actuators, and simulators that can
    integrate virtual appliances such as the washing machine. Vastardis et al. [264]
    proposed a user-centric smart-home gateway system architecture to support home-automation,
    energy usage management, and smart-grid operations. The gateway is supported by
    ML classification algorithms component such as C4.5 and RIPPER that is able to
    extract behavioral patterns of the users and feed them back to the gateway. Irrigation
    systems monitoring and smart watering system that keep track of rain and soil
    conditions and irrigate appropriately are a very cost-effective way to reduce
    outdoor water consumption. Investment in water management software and services,
    water-efficient plumbing, and irrigation management delivers economic and sustainability
    benefits. Water conservation and management is an example of such benefits [265].
    c: Comfort/Entertainment One of the main goals of SB research is to facilitate
    user daily life activities by increasing their satisfaction and comfort level.
    SBs supports automated appliance control and assistive services to offer a better
    quality of life. They utilize context awareness techniques to optimize the occupant’s
    comfort based on predefined constraints of conditions in a building environment.
    Typical examples of comfort services include lighting, background music, automation
    of routine activities, advanced user interfaces based on voice or gestures, etc.
    [30]. Other services related to comfort services in SB environments are Indoor
    Climate Control and Intelligent Thermostat [265]. Indoor Climate Control: Measurement
    and control of temperature, lighting, CO2 fresh air. In the SB environment, HVAC
    systems play an essential role in forming indoor environmental quality. Typically,
    HVAC systems are produced not only to heat and cool the air but also to draw in
    and circulate outdoor air in large buildings [266]. Kabir et al. [267] present
    a context-aware application that provides the service according to a predefined
    preference of a user. They use the KNN classifier to infer the predefined service
    that will maximize the user’s comfort and safety while requiring minimum explicit
    interaction of the user with the environment. Ahn et al. [268] proposed a deep
    learning model that estimates periodically the atmospheric changes and predict
    the indoor air quality of the near future. d: Safety/Security As the SB technology
    progresses, the role of ML and deep learning in security and connected devices
    will increase. Deep learning will continue to help gain insights using big data
    that were previously inaccessible, particularly in image and video. Advanced technologies
    such as behavioral analysis and ML to detect, categorize, and block new threats
    will be beneficial. In a traditional home system, as soon as a fire is detected
    the Fire/smoke detectors are activated and start sending a fire alarm. However,
    SB can perform much better than the traditional system. It not only sends an alarm
    but also turns on the light only in the safest route and guides the occupants
    of the building out, as well as it will unlock the doors and windows for smoke
    ventilation, turn off all the devices and call the nearest fire service station.
    Other than this, it can take video of the areas surrounding the building, provide
    the status of window breakage alarms, and automatically lock all the doors and
    the windows when the last person of the house leaves [30]. The main services for
    security and safety in SBs are: Perimeter Access Control, Liquid Presence, Intelligent
    Fire Alarm, Intrusion Detection, and Motion Detection Systems [265]. Perimeter
    Access Control service provides control to restricted areas and detects non-authorized
    users that access the areas. Access card provides a variety of solutions that
    allow staff members, vendors or contractors to access specific areas at specific
    times you designate. The same access card can also be utilized to check employee
    attendance. In addition, there is widespread use of biometric technology including
    fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans [269]. Additionally, liquid presence
    detection technique has been utilized in data centers, warehouses, and sensitive
    building grounds to prevent breakdowns and corrosion in such areas [270]. Intelligent
    Fire Alarm and its corresponding safety systems are crucial parts of an intelligent
    building. It is a system with multi-function sensors (i.e., chemical gas sensors,
    integrated sensor systems, and computer vision systems) These sensors enable measuring
    smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the building. They also can give warnings,
    howling alarms, and tell with a human voice about the place and level of smoke
    and CO. In addition, they can give a message on a smartphone if the smoke or the
    CO alarm goes off [271]. Examples of intrusion detection systems including window
    and door opening detection and intrusion prevention [265]. An infrared motion
    sensor is utilized to detect the motion in a specific area in the building. This
    sensor can reliably send alerts to the alarm panel, with the system implementing
    algorithms for adaption to environmental disturbances and reducing any false alarms
    [265]. Image recognition solution can be used in security software to identify
    people, places, objects, and more. It can also be used to detect unusual patterns
    and activities. Clarifai [272] specializes in a field of ML known as “computer
    vision” that teaches computers to “see” images and video. Clarifai’s technology
    can play a key role in security surveillance and at present, the company works
    only with home security. Each image is processed on a pixel by pixel basis through
    convoluted neural networks. Bangali and Shaligram [273] proposed a home security
    system that monitors the home when the user is away from the place. The system
    is composed of two methods: one uses a web camera to detect the intruder—whenever
    there is a motion detected in front of the camera, a security alert in terms of
    sound and an email is delivered to the occupant. And the other one is based on
    GSM technology that sends SMS. A home security system that sends alert messages
    to the house owner and police station in case of illegal invasion at home is proposed
    in [274]. The system consists of different sensor nodes as the input components
    while the output components respond to the signal received from the input components.
    The sensor nodes consist of a thief alarm, presence detecting circuit, and the
    break-in camera. Zhao and Ye [275] proposed a wireless home security system that
    utilizes low cost, low power consumption, and GSM/GPRS. The system has a user
    interface and it can respond to alarm incidents. e: Miscellaneous Projects CASAS
    [178] is a project by Washington State University that provides a noninvasive
    assistive environment for dementia patients at SBs. The project focuses on three
    main areas for SBs: medical monitoring, green living, and general comfort. CASAS
    project comprises of three layers: physical layer, middleware layer, and software
    applications layer. Aware Home Research Initiative (AHRI) [276] is a project that
    has constructed by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology for SB services
    in the fields of health and well-being, digital media and entertainment, and sustainability.
    AHRI utilizes a variety of sensors such as smart floor sensors, it also utilizes
    assistive robots for monitoring and helping the elderly. House_n [277] is a multi-disciplinary
    project leads by a group of researchers at the MIT. The main objective of the
    project is to facilitate the design of the smart home and its associated technologies,
    products, and services. The home is supplied with hundreds of various sensors
    that are installed almost in every part of the home that and being utilized to
    develop user interface applications that enable the users to control and monitor
    their environment, save resources, remain mentally and physically active, and
    stay healthy. The EasyLiving project [278] at Microsoft Research is concerned
    with the development of a prototype architecture and technologies to aggregate
    diverse devices into a coherent user experience for intelligent environments.
    The EasyLiving project was designed to provide context-aware computing services.
    The project utilizes a variety of sensors and cameras to track and recognize the
    human activities in the room by using the geometric model of a room and taking
    readings from sensors installed in the room. The Gator Tech Smart House project
    [279] is a programmable space specifically designed for the elderly and disabled
    developed by The University of Florida’s mobile and pervasive computing laboratory.
    The project’s goal is to create SB environments that can sense themselves and
    their residents. The project provides special cognitive services for the residents
    such as mobility, health, and other age-related impairments. A generic middleware
    is utilized to integrate system components in order to maintain a service definition
    for every sensor and actuator in the building. The components of the middleware
    including separate physical, sensor platform, service, knowledge, context management,
    and application layers [280]. Other well-known smart home projects include DOMUS
    [281] which is a research project, by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada,
    that supports mobile computing and cognitive assistance in smart buildings. The
    project aims to assist people suffering from Alzheimer’s type dementia, schizophrenia,
    cranial trauma, or intellectual deficiencies. Adaptive House project [136] at
    The University of Colorado has constructed a prototype system that is equipped
    with a variety of sensors that provide different environmental information including
    sound, motion, temperature, light levels. In addition, actuators that control
    the space and water heaters; lighting units, and ceiling fans. In Asia, there
    are also some other smart building projects have been developed, such as “Welfare
    Techno House” project, which is equipped with different sensors such as ECG, body
    weight, and other temperature measured indicators [282]. Ubiquitous Home project
    [283] is another smart building project in Japan, which utilizes RFID, PIR, pressure
    sensors, as well as cameras and microphones for monitoring elderly adults. Summary:
    Recently, several different context-aware and ML techniques have been utilized
    to support SB services. ML-based approaches are capable to perform better prediction
    and adaptation than others. The philosophy behind ML is to automate the learning
    process that enables algorithms to create analytical models with the support of
    available data. ML can be applied in different learning styles including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement
    learning when the learning is the result of the interaction between a model and
    the environment. The general uses of ML for SB services are detection, recognition,
    prediction, and optimization. In the section, we also talked about how to acquire
    the context from multiple distributed and heterogeneous sources and the techniques
    for modeling and processing such context to be used in the application services
    of SBs. We also talked about the most used tools and platforms ML and others for
    real-time data analytics by ML community to efficiently process and learn from
    big data. Without such ML tools, one would have to implement all of the techniques
    from scratch requiring expertise in the techniques and in efficient engineering
    practices. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Research on
    SBs has made great strides in recent years, but a number of challenges remain.
    We present some major challenges related to SBs in this part of the work. These
    challenges will channelize the research directions for future SBs. A. Security
    and Privacy Wherever there is an interconnection of two systems or networks (wired
    or wireless), there are issues of security and privacy and the same is true in
    the case of SB. Security is an essential role in SB environments. Any SB application
    should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Access control must be
    included in SB systems, for instance, the unauthorized users should not be able
    to disconnect the alarm system by connecting the pervasive system [284]. There
    is a massive amount of streaming that is collected from the various installed
    sensors and appliances, such data needs to be processed and stored. Hence, cloud
    computing services can be utilized for this purpose. However, with all of this
    data that is transmitted, the issue of losing the privacy increases. Therefore,
    different encryption techniques are needed to preserve personal privacy [285].
    There are specific challenges related to the user’s privacy including challenges
    related to the data privacy of personal information and the privacy of the individual’s
    physical location and tracking. That needs for privacy enhancement technologies
    and relevant protection laws and tools for identity management of users and objects
    [286]. The recent trend of ML research has focused on handling security and privacy
    issues in SB environments. There are different security-related services have
    utilized ML techniques, such as determining safe device behavior by detecting
    and blocking activities and potentially harmful behavior [287]. ML techniques
    have the potential to reduce security gap because of their capability to learn,
    identify and detect the users’ habits and behaviors. Consequently, it can detect
    the abnormal behaviors predicting risks and intrusions before they happen. For
    instance, ML models learn the routine of the users, such as the time they get
    home or go to sleep. These models can suggest rules based on those detected behaviors
    from all connected devices [288]. B. SBS and Context-Aware Computing In the SB
    environment, there exists a massive amount of raw data being continuously collected
    about the various human activities and behaviors. It is important to develop techniques
    that convert this raw data into valuable knowledge [289]. Context awareness and
    ML techniques are expected to provide great support to process and store big data
    and create important knowledge from all this data [290]. The process of data interpretation
    and knowledge extraction has the following challenges including addressing noisy
    real-world data and the ability to develop further inference techniques that do
    not have the limitations of traditional algorithms. Usually, It is very complex
    to formalize and model the contextual information related to human behaviors in
    a standard way due to the complex physiological, psychological and behavioral
    aspects of human beings [291]. The humans communicate through rich languages as
    well as gestures and expressions. Modern ubiquitous computer systems lack an automatic
    mechanism of inferring information as the humans do. New research is necessary
    to raise human activities and behaviors recognition to understand the complex
    dependencies between the apps and humans [292], [293]. The context-aware prompting
    systems have essential applications in SBs such as emergency notifications, medication
    prompting, heart rate monitoring, generation of agenda reminders, and weather
    alerts. However, issuing prompts for all detected errors can possibly be false
    positives, and consequently, lead to annoyance and sometimes prove to be unsafe
    for specific activities. ML methods can be used for an accurate and precise prediction
    when a person faces difficulty while doing daily life activities [294]. C. Personal
    Data Stream Management in SBS The data streaming management system is able to
    process and transfer raw data collected from a variety of sensors to information,
    it is also able to fuse this information to a feature and directly process features
    [295]. While the data processing for a single SB is simple, it is more complex
    when processing the data from multiple SBs, because there are different people
    that tend to share less common interests and have opposing interests concerning
    the processed data [296]. The simple sensors in an SB environment can detect different
    events related to temperature, motion, light, or weather. Moreover, other appliances
    like a television and a telephone can also send their status or other data as
    events. All this data from different sensors can be used by SB services to detect
    specific states and send a request to some actuators according to specific predefined
    rules, for instance, turn on the light if the television is used [297]. However,
    this approach is not generalizable in case of a group of people residing in the
    same building. Although it can work well for one certain person when personal
    preferences can be automatically learned for an individual person, therefore each
    of the residents has to define their own set of rules [298]. Because of the increasing
    number of sensors that produce data streams, the traditional analyzing and processing
    techniques of these data streams are mostly impractical now [299]. Despite the
    availability of new tools and systems for handling massive amounts of data continuously
    generating by a variety of sensors in SBs, however, the real promise of advanced
    data analytics to still lies beyond the realm of pure technology [296]. In [300]
    discuses research challenges for data streams of real-world applications. They
    analyze issues concerning privacy, timing, preprocessing, relational and event
    streams, model complexity and evaluation, availability of information, and problems
    related to legacy systems. D. Big Data Challenges in SBS Nowadays, a variety of
    sensing technology in the SBs can be utilized to collect a massive amount of heterogeneous
    data at a reasonable cost. Typically, hundreds of thousands of transactions can
    be generated by a single SB every day. The process of storing this data over the
    long-term is challenging [258]. We can imagine the challenges and opportunities
    that the companies or government will encounter in the future to manage incoming
    data from dozens of SBs. This new data could provide us with more contextual information
    that consequently leads to much better services to the occupants [301]. In the
    world of big data, despite the availability massive amount of data, however, it
    is not necessarily easy to obtain valuable information from this data utilizing
    the traditional approaches like trial and error to extract meaningful information
    from this data. Analyzing these massive amounts of data requires new technologies
    to store, organize, and process big data effectively, it needs high-performance
    processors that enable uncovering the insights in big data. It also requires flexible
    cloud computing services and virtualization techniques, as well as software such
    as Apache Hadoop and Spark [302]. It requires providing appropriate ML techniques
    which differ from the traditional approaches for effective and efficient solution
    of the above issues. For these reasons, researchers have recently started to think
    about the problems and opportunities resulting from the adoption of big data in
    SB environments [303], [304]. The information extracted from this big data has
    significant value and could greatly contribute in the future of SBs as assistive
    tools and for better services delivery. That is why it is necessary that the researchers
    start to analyze and think about the solutions for the current and future challenges
    of big data in SBs [305]. E. Interoperability Interoperability means that two
    (or more) systems work together unchanged even though they were not necessarily
    designed to work together. When equipment, devices or appliances having different
    communication and networking technologies can communicate effectively, interoperability
    is satisfied. It is a challenge to ensure that an SB that has various components
    will be intelligible. Typically, each of these components might have been produced
    by different vendors, each of which may have created under different design constraints
    and considerations [306]. Therefore it becomes essential to satisfy interoperability
    so that a number of heterogeneous communication and networking technologies could
    coexist in various parts of SBs. For example, an energy management system may
    use Wi-Fi and ZigBee for communication purposes. A lot of work can be done in
    this context [307]. F. Reliability We can expect that the reliability is one of
    the main concern of occupants and developers of SB systems. A variety of appliances
    and devices present in SB such as televisions, microwave, washing machines etc.
    are required exceedingly to be reliable. Achieving expected levels of reliability,
    especially when linked with communication technologies utilized with these devices
    that may be expected in SBs, is a great challenge. There are different reasons
    for these challenges differences in technological approaches, regulations, development
    culture, and the expectations of the market [306]. G. Integration The key to a
    successful SB implementation is integration: linking building systems such as
    lighting, power meters, water meters, pumps, heating, and chiller plants together
    using sensors and control systems, and then connecting the building automation
    system to enterprise systems. Integration allows executives to gain smart-building
    benefits, both in new construction and by gradually transforming existing buildings
    into SBs. What these SBs have in common is integration. Generally, the integration
    in SB systems brings a range of benefits from energy savings to productivity gains
    to sustainability. The SB systems can be attached to enterprise business systems
    to add another level of intelligence that enhances decision-making and improves
    building performance [2]. However, integrating multiple systems is very challenging
    as each individual system has its own assumptions, strategies to control the physical
    world, and semantics. As an example of integrating two systems in SB, assume a
    system that is responsible for energy management, and another system for health
    care are running concurrently. In this case, the integrated system should not
    turn off medical appliances to save energy while they are being used as suggested
    by the health care system [292]. As a future perspective for SBs, You will wake
    up to the sound of the alarm, at the same time the available sensors will be aware
    that you are waking up. The other sensors such as light sensors will automatically
    turn on the light in the building, while the thermostat will warm the area that
    you are about to use in the building. Your coffee will start to brew, you will
    also get a notification on your phone about the weather. The other sensors in
    the kitchen and refrigerator will remind you with a list of items that you will
    need to pick up on your way from your workplace to home to make dinner. When you
    leave your house, you can press a button from your phone to self-drive your car
    out of the garage. After that, the security system will start monitoring and controlling
    the home. Such the doors will automatically lock. Appliances will switch to an
    energy-saving mode. When the home sensors sense utilizing geofencing technology
    that you are way back home, it will get ready again for your arrival, the thermostat
    will warm things up, the garage door will open as you pull up, and your favorite
    music will start to play when you walk in [141]. Summary: Although the recent
    researches have been done in the SBs field, there is a need for a lot more efforts;
    however, we believe that SBs are possible for the mass market in the near future.
    The main challenges and future research directions of this eld can be summarized
    as follows: User context in term of behavior and intention should be studied and
    respected whenever possible; Further research is needed into context-aware prompting
    systems, personal data streaming and big data analysis of occupants in SB environment;
    Some of the other challenges like the interoperability, reliability, and integration
    still require more attention. SECTION VII. Conclusions The promise of smart buildings
    (SBs) is a world of appliances that anticipate your needs and do exactly what
    you want them to at the touch of a button. Since SBs and their inhabitants create
    voluminous amounts of streaming data, SB researchers are looking towards techniques
    from ML and big data analytics for managing, processing, and gaining insights
    from this big data. This paper reviewed the most important aspects of SBs with
    particular focus on what is being done and what are the issues that require further
    research in ML and data analytics domains. In this regards, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey of the research works that relate to the use of ML and
    big data particularly for building smart infrastructure and services. Although
    the recent advancements in technologies that make the concept of SBs feasible,
    there are still a variety of challenges that limit large-scale real-world systems
    in SBs field. Addressing these challenges soon will be a powerful driving force
    for advancements in both industrial and academic fields of SB research. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    in Commercial-Scale Crops Working in a Multi-Cloud Environment. Sensors 2020,
    20, 7163. Copy Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that
    IoT, cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

    \ of this review was to synthesize existing evidence on GIS and RS applica-\n\
    tion in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policy and practice for improving\
    \ agriculture\nsustainability and identifying obstacles to their application,\
    \ particularly in low- and middle-income\ncountries. Systematic searches were\
    \ conducted in the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, Bielefeld\nAcademic Search\
    \ Engine, COnnecting REpositories (CORE), and Google Scholar. We identiﬁed\n2113\
    \ articles published between 2010–2021, out of which 40 articles met the inclusion\
    \ criteria. The\nresults show that GIS technology application in agriculture has\
    \ gained prominence in the last decade,\nwith 66% of selected papers being published\
    \ in the last six years. The main GIS application areas\nidentiﬁed included: crop\
    \ yield estimation, soil fertility assessment, cropping patterns monitoring,\n\
    drought assessment, pest and crop disease detection and management, precision\
    \ agriculture, and fer-\ntilizer and weed management. GIS technology has the potential\
    \ to enhance agriculture sustainability\nthrough integrating the spatial dimension\
    \ of agriculture into agriculture policies. In addition, GIS\npotential in promoting\
    \ evidenced informed decision making is growing. There is, however, a big gap\n\
    in GIS application in sub-Saharan Africa, with only one paper originating from\
    \ this region. With the\ngrowing threat of climate change to agriculture and food\
    \ security, there is an increased need for the\nintegration of GIS in policy and\
    \ decision making in improving agriculture sustainability.\nKeywords: GIS; RS;\
    \ spatial autocorrelation; policy integration; agri-spatial policy integration;\
    \ spatial;\nsustainable agri-food systems\n1. Introduction\nThe demand for food\
    \ globally has risen tremendously and is expected to increase\nto 59–98% by the\
    \ year 2050 [1]. However, the growing concerns are that the agricultural\nfood\
    \ production systems are unable to match the high demand, especially in poor na-\n\
    tions, causing an intensifying level of food insecurities [2]. The inefﬁciency\
    \ of the food\nproduction systems is also one of the reasons for food insecurity\
    \ [3]. How best to facilitate\nincreased food production without jeopardizing\
    \ land and water resources, energy, and the\nenvironment is a momentous task that\
    \ government and policymakers have to address [4].\nIn many low- and middle-income\
    \ countries (LMICs), most of the food production is\nrural-based, dominated by\
    \ smallholder and subsistence farmers. Enhancing smallholders’\nsustainability\
    \ requires that farmers are empowered with practicable information that en-\n\
    ables them not only to make evidence-informed decisions but also to implement\
    \ them in\nactivities that could increase their farm productivity and sustainability.\
    \ In efforts toward\ntransforming the weak and often inefﬁcient traditional subsistence\
    \ production practices,\nsustainable production approaches [5,6] that support\
    \ production-efﬁciency-enhancement\nand better agronomic practices are needed.\
    \ These include planting climate-resilient crops,\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169974\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n2 of 15\nhigh-yielding crop varieties, crop yield\
    \ forecasting, integrated pest management, as well as\nintegrating biodiversity\
    \ solutions in sustainable food production systems [7,8] Ultimately,\nthese novel\
    \ interventions would require comprehensive, up-to-date datasets (spatial and\n\
    non-spatial) and the adoption of advanced GIS technologies that can synthesize\
    \ and inte-\ngrate social, spatial, economic, demographic, and environmental data\
    \ in agriculture. The\noutput of this synthesis would be evidence-based spatial\
    \ knowledge that improves our\nunderstanding of agriculture sustainability and\
    \ in supporting better policies and decision-\nmaking processes.\nContemporary\
    \ advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing\n(RS), and\
    \ Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) technologies present an opportunity to\n\
    acquire and operationalize high-resolution satellite imagery and digital spatial\
    \ data [9].\nIn the agriculture sector, these spatial data have aided in the investigation\
    \ of the spatial\nlinkages of social, physical, agroecological, and environmental\
    \ complexities and how they\naffect agriculture sustainability. GIS technology\
    \ provides users with a mixture of geo-spatial\ninformation management tools and\
    \ methods that allow users to collect, store, integrate,\nquery, display, and\
    \ analyze geospatial data at various scales [10]. Remote sensing technol-\nogy\
    \ acquire images and other information about crops and soil from sensors mounted\
    \ on\ndifferent platforms including satellites, airborne remote sensing (manned\
    \ drones and un-\nmanned aerial vehicles), and ground-based equipment that is\
    \ then processed by computers\nto aid agricultural decision-making systems [11,12].\n\
    The spatial context of agriculture can be viewed from the perspective of farmers’\n\
    differentiated access to livelihood capitals, local resources, and access to essential\
    \ infras-\ntructure and services existing in a locality. In a GIS system, the\
    \ data containing each of\nthese aspects can be deconstructed as nested spatial\
    \ layers, each rooted in local geogra-\nphy by geographic coordinates captured\
    \ using GPS [13]. These spatial layers can then\nbe processed and analyzed in\
    \ a GIS system in multiple ways to reveal crop and soil con-\nditions and spatial\
    \ interactions, predict crop trends, monitor land-use change, monitor\npests,\
    \ and in biodiversity conservation [14–17]. They can also be used to map and reveal\n\
    spatial impediments to agricultural production, or even new information for improving\n\
    agricultural sustainability.\nIn recent times, the increasing complexity associated\
    \ with agriculture production sys-\ntems has aroused policymakers’ interest in\
    \ investigating how the spatial aspect “dimension”\nof agriculture can be exploited\
    \ using advanced GIS, RS, and GPS technologies to improve\nagricultural productivity\
    \ and better production practices [18,19]. The integration of GIS\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture has increased the opportunities for the development of even bet-\n\
    ter spatial explicit frameworks that support the creation of dynamic agriculture\
    \ databases\nand interactive systems [20]. Such database systems allow users to\
    \ interact with spatially\nreferenced agriculture data in real-time, while accurately\
    \ providing precise positional data,\nthus providing enhanced frameworks for decision\
    \ making. New ﬁelds that apply GIS in\nagriculture have emerged as a result. These\
    \ include precision agriculture, automated farm\nsystems, crop yield forecasting,\
    \ climate change detections, and the real-time monitoring of\ncrop production\
    \ [11,12,21]. These have the capability of improving agricultural production\n\
    and food security.\nIn this regard, several recent systematic literature reviews\
    \ have been conducted to\nilluminate and consolidate various ways GIS, RS, and\
    \ GPS technologies have been applied\nin the agriculture sector. García-Berná\
    \ et al. [11] used a systematic mapping study to focus\non the current trend and\
    \ what new opportunities in remote sensing techniques offer in\nagriculture. Their\
    \ study found increased uptake of RS technologies in the acquisition and\nextracting\
    \ of georeferenced data from satellite imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\
    Spatial data from these technologies have been applied in several areas including\
    \ crop\ngrowth and yield estimation, cropland parameter extraction, weed and disease\
    \ detection,\nand the monitoring of water and nutrients in plants. How this application\
    \ could be\nintegrated to improve spatial-based agriculture policymaking was not\
    \ elaborated by the\nauthors. The Al-Ismaili [22] review highlighted the integrated\
    \ application of RS and GIS\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n3 of 15\ntechniques\
    \ in precision agriculture and in the mapping, detection, and classiﬁcation of\n\
    the greenhouse through aerial images and satellites. How such a technique could\
    \ be\nassimilated into enhancing policymaking was not mentioned. In yet another\
    \ meta-review,\nWeiss et al. [12] research highlighted the emerging development\
    \ in RS that strengthens the\nspeciﬁc application of RS in crop breeding, agricultural\
    \ land use monitoring, crop yield\nforecasting, and biodiversity loss. Sharma,\
    \ Kamble, and Gunasekaran [23] focused on\nhow GIS data applications have assisted\
    \ in the development of precision agriculture. The\nauthors proposed a framework,\
    \ “Big GIS Analytic”, to guide how big GIS data should\nbe applied in the agriculture\
    \ supply chain. Their framework also lays a foundation for\na theoretical structure\
    \ for improving the quality of GIS data application in agriculture to\nelevate\
    \ productivity. These studies help us to understand how GIS and RS applications\
    \ in\nagricultural production systems have advanced. However, the available systematic\
    \ reviews\nseem not to explicitly provide how GIS and RS technologies could enhance\
    \ the integration\nof the spatial dimension of agriculture into policy frameworks\
    \ and interventions.\nThere is an increasing demand for evidence-supported decision\
    \ making to assist policymak-\ners in assessing the local needs of farmers, improving\
    \ production and supply value chains, and\ndeveloping spatial based-interventions.\
    \ In this regard, this review aimed at synthesizing existing\nevidence on GIS\
    \ and RS application in agriculture in enhancing evidence-informed policies for\n\
    improving agriculture sustainability and identifying obstacles for their application,\
    \ particularly\nin LMICs. The review draws on a decade of literature, from 2011\
    \ to 2021, to examine the current\nand future perspectives on integrating GIS\
    \ in policies that support agriculture sustainability.\nThe main contributions\
    \ of the study are to provide readers and policymakers with evidence on\nhow GIS\
    \ technology has been used in the agriculture sector to improve agricultural production\n\
    practices and inform how the technology can be adopted to improve evidence-based\
    \ decision\nmaking and policies. This paper is structured as follows: after the\
    \ introduction, we describe the\nmethodology applied to select and review the\
    \ articles; then, we detail the findings in Section 3.\nIn Section 4, we highlight\
    \ obstacles to applying GIS in agriculture policy and practice. Lastly,\nSections\
    \ 5 and 6 give the conclusion and the limitations of the study.\n2. Review Methodology\n\
    2.1. Process of Screening\nThe search used the bibliographic databases SCOPUS,\
    \ Web of Science/Clarivate,\nBielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE), and COnnecting\
    \ REpositories (CORE), as well\nas Google Scholar. The following inclusion criteria\
    \ were employed to screen for titles and\nabstracts: (1) full articles in peer-reviewed\
    \ journals; (2) articles published between January\n2010 and October 2021; (3)\
    \ written in the English language; and (4) those associated with\nthe application\
    \ of GIS or RS in agriculture. The following search string was applied as\nindex\
    \ terms to search: “TITLE, ABSTRACT (Agriculture* OR Plant OR Crop*) AND (GIS\n\
    OR Geographic OR Information OR Systems) AND (Remote OR Sensing OR RS)”. The full\n\
    search syntax is found in Table A1 in the Appendix A. Following the eligibility\
    \ criteria, a\ntotal of 2113 articles were found; 701 articles were identiﬁed\
    \ from SCOPUS, 104 from Web\nof Science, 468 from Bielefeld Academic Search Engine\
    \ (BASE), 68 from CORE, and 238\nrecords from Google Scholar. After excluding\
    \ duplicates and studies for which no full text\nor access was available (988\
    \ articles), 1223 articles were eligible for further screening.\nThe ﬂow of the\
    \ screening process is shown in Figure A1 in the Appendix A. The ﬁrst\nscreening\
    \ was based on the title and abstract checking for relevance to the purpose of\
    \ this\narticle, based on which a substantial number of articles (n = 554) were\
    \ excluded. Further\nexclusion criteria were based on (1) articles focusing on\
    \ the general application of GIS, i.e.,\nsuitability analysis and site selection\
    \ analysis (n = 81) and (2) irrelevant topics or focus\n(n = 171). After the exclusion\

    \ sections below.\n3.2.1. Crop Yield Estimation/Forecasting\nMonitoring crop growth\
    \ and early crop yield forecasting over agricultural ﬁelds is an\nimportant procedure\
    \ for food security planning and agricultural economic return prediction.\nThe\
    \ continued advancement in RS and GIS technologies has improved the process and\n\
    techniques of monitoring the development of crops and estimating their yields\
    \ [26,29,31].\nSeveral studies demonstrate the application of integrated GIS and\
    \ RS technologies in crop\nyield estimation. Memon et al.’s [24] study demonstrated\
    \ how integrating multispectral\nLandsat satellite imagery and comparing different\
    \ RS-based spectral indices were effective\nin measuring the percentage of wheat\
    \ straw cover and successively determining its effect\non yields of rice crops.\
    \ The knowledge can inform long-term planning of agriculture\nsustainability in\
    \ rice-wheat cropping systems. The result of the research by Hassan and\nGoheer\
    \ [27] showed that the accurate early estimation of wheat crop yield before harvesting\n\
    can be determined by using vegetation indices derived from moderate resolution\
    \ imaging\nspectroradiometer satellite imagery and crop yield data and the GIS\
    \ modelling approach. In\nyet another study, Hassan and Goheer [28] used a GIS-based\
    \ environment policy integrated\nclimate model that provided a practical tool\
    \ for simulating rice crop yield. The model\ncombined regional level crop level\
    \ data, soil data, farm management data, and climatic data\nto spatially estimate\
    \ variations in crop yield. Likewise, Al-Gaadi et al. [29] extracted the\nnormalized\
    \ difference vegetation index and soil-adjusted vegetation index from Landsat\n\
    satellite images acquired during the potato growth stages to predict potato tuber\
    \ crop\nyield. GIS- and RS-based crop yield forecasting models could have a wider\
    \ application in\ninforming spatially based agriculture policies. For example,\
    \ based on the output of these\nmodels, policy intervention can be designed to\
    \ manipulate the speciﬁc contributors to crop\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n\
    7 of 15\nyields (which include farm management techniques, weather conditions,\
    \ water availability,\naltitude, terrain, plant health, and policy intervention)\
    \ [25,30]. Forecasting crop yields\nwell before harvest is crucial, especially\
    \ in a region characterized by climatic uncertainties.\nMonitoring agricultural\
    \ crop growth conditions and the prediction of potential crop yield is\nimportant\
    \ in planning and policymaking for food security and agricultural economic return\n\
    prediction [26,28,31]. This could include developing policies for improving agriculture\n\
    productivity and sustainability [28]. In feeding a growing population in LMICs,\
    \ agricultural\nproduction systems must strive to reduce the food production yield\
    \ gap between current\nyields achieved by farmers and those potentially attainable\
    \ in rainfed subsistence farming\nsystems. In addressing this mismatch, the study\
    \ by Hochman et al. [30] developed a model\nthat integrated statistical yield\
    \ and cropping area data, remotely sensed data, cropping\nsystem simulation, and\
    \ GIS mapping to assess and map wheat yield gaps.\n3.2.2. Soil Quality/Fertility\
    \ Assessment\nSoil quality assessment is critical for designing sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices\n(optimal agricultural use) that can help bridge the current food\
    \ production and demand\ngap in overcoming the food security problem. The availability\
    \ of RS datasets and GIS spatial\nmodelling techniques provides new opportunities\
    \ for measuring/evaluating soil quality at\ndifferent spatial scales [33,36].\
    \ Shokr et al. [35] developed a spatially-explicit soil quality\nmodel by combining\
    \ soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties and integrating\nthese\
    \ with a digital elevation model and Sentinel-2 satellite image to produce digital\
    \ soil\nmaps. Abdelfattah and Kumar [32] describe the application GIS-enabled\
    \ web-based soil\ninformation system that provides a descriptive, quantitative,\
    \ and geospatial soil database\nin a simple interface. The system was applied\
    \ to determine the sufﬁciency potential of soils\nfor plant growing and management.\
    \ Using GIS and RS technologies, Abdellatif et al. [38]\ndeveloped a spatial model\
    \ for the assessment of soil quality. His model combined four\nmain soil quality\
    \ indices (soil fertility index, soil physical index, soil chemical index, and\n\
    geomorphological properties Index) and GIS ordinary kriging spatial interpolation\
    \ to map\nthe soil quality index. The application of these GIS-based models provides\
    \ evidence-based\nways to improve soil quality management. This would enable decision\
    \ makers, policy\nformulators, land-use planners, and agriculturalists to efﬁciently\
    \ manage soil resources to\nensure the sustainable use of agricultural lands according\
    \ to their potential [34,36,37]. Thus,\nassessing soil quality indicators would\
    \ be important for sustainable agricultural policies\nand practices and in achieving\
    \ food security.\n3.2.3. Crop Mapping and Monitoring Decision Support Systems\n\
    In an era of unpredictable climate changes, agricultural crop monitoring analysis\n\
    could help government policymakers and farmers plan and design cropping patterns\
    \ that\nadapt to water availability. Agricultural monitoring systems integrate\
    \ multiple geospatial\ndata sets and cropping system models into computer algorithms\
    \ to spatially compute\nand simulate optimum scenarios for site-speciﬁc conditions\
    \ for crop production [42]. A\ncrop monitoring system is developed by integrating\
    \ geospatial data obtained by high-\nresolution remote sensing with a web GIS\
    \ geoportal interface [41]. Santosh and Suresh [39]\ndemonstrated the uniqueness\
    \ of combining GIS and RS in a tool for crop selection and\nrotation analysis\
    \ at the farm level to improve crop management decisions. Cropping\npatterns simulation\
    \ is determined by irrigation water availability, which in turn is affected\n\
    by changes in climate and irrigation water extraction policies. Wang et al. [16]\
    \ combined\nGIS and irrigation water availability simulation models to analyze\
    \ the cropping patterns\nbased on the forecast of irrigation water availability.\
    \ A GIS web-based crop mapping\nand monitoring decision support system at the\
    \ farm level could help farmers to access\ninformation and take appropriate measures\
    \ to improve crop production [39]. Such a\nsystem can have a wider application\
    \ in supporting agronomic decision making including\noptimizing land and labor\
    \ productivities, enhancing higher cropping intensities, and\nSustainability 2022,\
    \ 14, 9974\n8 of 15\nproducing better crop yield [40]. This can increase crop\
    \ production and ensure better crop\nmanagement, in the long run, and precision\
    \ irrigation management.\n3.2.4. Agricultural Drought Assessment\nUsing spatial\
    \ datasets generated by satellite RS and GIS technologies offers very useful\n\
    information for assessing and modelling agricultural drought-risk patterns, monitoring\n\
    drought conditions, and producing drought vulnerability (risk) maps [48]. Hoque\
    \ et al. [43]\nintegrated geospatial techniques with fuzzy logic to develop a\
    \ comprehensive spatial\ndrought risk inventory model for operational drought\
    \ management. This model success-\nfully identiﬁed the spatial extents and distribution\
    \ of agricultural drought risk. Sehgal and\nDhakar [44] used GIS and high spatial\
    \ resolution RS-derived indicators of crop sensitivity to\ndevelop a methodology\
    \ that assessed and mapped, at a local scale, key biophysical factors\ncontributing\
    \ to agricultural drought vulnerability. The drought vulnerability maps could\n\
    inform policymakers in formulating spatially explicit policies for drought mitigation\
    \ and\nintervention strategies [45,46]. In addition, vulnerability maps could\
    \ be used to indicate\nwhere socioeconomic development policy programs should\
    \ be given priority [47].\n3.2.5. Pest and Crop Disease Detection and Management\n\
    Several geospatial tools and techniques continue to be developed to aid farmers\
    \ in\ncrop disease control and management strategies. Several studies [49–52]\
    \ provide practical\napplication of satellite RS data and Geospatial techniques\
    \ for sustainable crop disease\ndetection and management. RS technology including\
    \ Airborne and satellite imagery\nacquired during growing seasons has been used\
    \ for early- and within-season detection,\nmapping of some crop diseases, the\
    \ control of recurring diseases in future seasons, and\nassessing economic loss\
    \ caused by frost damage [49]. Santoso et al. [50] used high-resolution\nQuickBird\
    \ satellite imagery to effectively detect spatial patterns of oil palm plants\
    \ infected\nby basal stem rot disease. They used six vegetation indices derived\
    \ from visible and\nnear-infrared bands satellite imagery to successfully discriminate\
    \ between healthy and\ninfected oil palms. Using precision agriculture technologies\
    \ and remote sensed imagery,\nYang [52] showed how site-speciﬁc fungicide application\
    \ to disease-infested areas has been\nimplemented for effective control of the\
    \ disease. In the future, new approaches that apply\ngeoinformation technologies\
    \ in monitoring and management of pest and crop disease\ndetection could reduce\
    \ the effect of pesticides and herbicide chemicals on the environment.\n3.2.6.\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nIn precision agriculture, automated geospatial analysis\
    \ and decision support algo-\nrithms can provide valuable scientiﬁc information\
    \ to policymakers for better agriculture\npolicy development. Precision agriculture\
    \ practices, which employ integrated GIS, RS,\nand GPS technologies, have gained\
    \ prominence in their ability to optimize crop produc-\ntion, facilitate site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop management, and reduce the application of agrochem-\nicals. Toscano et\
    \ al. [58] demonstrated the usefulness of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 im-\nages to\
    \ depict the within-ﬁeld spatial variability of wheat yield, which is key for\
    \ adopt-\ning precision farming techniques. This provided a potential alternative\
    \ to traditional\nfarming practices by improving site-speciﬁc management and agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nGarcía et al. [59] tested the performance of remote sensing drones\
    \ as mobile gateways to\nprovide a guide to the optimal drone parameters for successful\
    \ Wi-Fi data transmission\nbetween sensor nodes and the gateway in precision agriculture\
    \ systems. The study suc-\ncessfully demonstrated that drones (ﬂying at the lowest\
    \ velocity, at a height of 24 m, and\nwith an antenna with 25 m of coverage) can\
    \ be used as a remote sensing tool to gather the\ndata from the nodes deployed\
    \ on the ﬁelds for crop monitoring and management. This had\nthe potential to\
    \ increase the adoption of precision agriculture by even smallholder farmers.\n\
    Segarra et al.’s [60] study speciﬁcally focused to understand the European Space\
    \ Agency’s\ntwin Sentinel-2 satellites’ features and their application in precision\
    \ agriculture. Their study\nhighlights that Sentinel-2 has dramatically increased\
    \ the capabilities for agricultural moni-\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n9 of\
    \ 15\ntoring and crop management, abiotic and biotic stresses detection, improved\
    \ the estimation\nof crop yields, enhanced crop type classiﬁcations, and provided\
    \ a variety of other useful\napplications in agriculture. All of these contribute\
    \ to increasing the adoption of precision\nagriculture, which leads to more productive\
    \ and sustainable agriculture management and\nenvironmental sustainability [61,62].\
    \ In precision agriculture, plantation-rows extraction\nusing satellite image-based\
    \ solutions is essential in crop harvesting, pest management, and\nplant grow-rate\
    \ predictions. The study of Fareed and Rehman [55] used GIS and RS to\ndesign\
    \ an automated method to extract plantation rows from a drone-based image point\n\
    clouds-based digital surface model. The automatic plantation rows extraction can\
    \ be used\nto quantify plantation-row damage assessment in precision agriculture.\n\
    3.2.7. Weed Management and Fertilizer Decision Support System\nAccurate weed distribution\
    \ mapping could greatly enhance efﬁciency in weed man-\nagement and reduce weed\
    \ damage, overhead costs of herbicide application, and the ratio-\nnalization\
    \ of fertilizers [57]. Dunaieva et al. [21] used GIS technologies to produce accurate\n\
    weed distribution maps in rice farms. This information improved the efﬁciency\
    \ of input\napplication, thus reducing the consumption of inputs including herbicides,\
    \ fungicides,\nand weeding labor costs. This in turn reduced the weed damage and\
    \ crop production\noverhead costs. Xie et al. [56] demonstrated the application\
    \ of GIS in the development of a\nGIS-based Fertilizer Decision Support System\
    \ (FDSS) by integrating RS data, ﬁeld surveys,\nand expert knowledge to develop\
    \ a soil spatial database on the SuperMap platform for crop\nmanagement systems.\
    \ The application of FDSS in agricultural production had beneﬁts,\nsuch as increasing\
    \ fertilizer utilization efﬁciency, thus lowering production costs.\n4. Obstacles\
    \ to Applying GIS in Agriculture Policy and Practice\nGenerally, the use of GIS\
    \ and RS technologies is not a panacea to successful evidence-\nbased policy and\
    \ practice and has its downside. The success of the geospatial technology\napplication\
    \ depends on its proper use, quality data, and considerable resources in its man-\n\
    agement. In countries that suffer low resources, such as LMICs, the cost of the\
    \ technology\nand lack of appropriate skills jeopardize its wider use and adoption\
    \ [63]. Simulating crop\nyield production is always challenging due to the variety\
    \ of cropping systems and levels\nof technology used. Accurate crop yield gap\
    \ assessment would require improvements\nin input data quality, including accurate\
    \ weather parameters, better soil characterization,\nand spatially distributed\
    \ land use data [28]. It would also demand the setting up of in-\nstrumented geo-referenced\
    \ validation sites that provide comprehensive survey data to\ninform a continuous\
    \ improvement cycle for yield gap assessment [30]. As such, future im-\nprovements\
    \ in current remote sensing technology and the development of better-integrated\n\
    cropping systems models would provide more accurate inputs for yield gap assessment.\n\
    In drought vulnerability assessment and mapping, most studies reported in the\
    \ literature\ntended to use aggregated spatial data at higher spatial scales (national\
    \ or regional level), but\nnot at a finer scale (i.e., local level). Since the\
    \ intensity of drought hazards is more felt and\nmanifested at the local level,\
    \ a detailed drought-risk mapping at a finer scale would require\nhigh resolution\
    \ remote sensing and the use of locally contextual indicators to yield a full\n\
    picture of vulnerability. This would have more relevance to policymakers whose\
    \ intent is to\nformulate and implement mitigation interventions at the local\
    \ level. With the prediction of\nmore severe and frequent drought uncertainties\
    \ and increasingly threats from climate change,\ndrought-risk mapping that incorporates\
    \ all the spatially explicit risk components would be a\nhighly efficient contribution\
    \ to drought-mitigating strategies. More skills and knowledge on\nthe use of geospatial\
    \ techniques for agricultural drought risk are needed.\nIn crop disease detection,\
    \ challenges still exist in mapping them using airborne or\nsatellite imagery.\
    \ Although many crop diseases can be successfully detected and mapped\nusing satellite\
    \ imagery, each disease has its characteristics that would require different\n\
    procedures for detection and management. According to Yang, [52] “some diseases\
    \ are\ndifﬁcult to detect, especially when multiple biotic and abiotic conditions\
    \ with similar\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n10 of 15\nspectral characteristics\
    \ exist within the same ﬁeld” (pg. 531). Recurring diseases would\nrequire consistent\
    \ historical imagery and spatial-temporal data, while emerging diseases\nare more\
    \ difﬁcult to detect. Yang argues that more advanced RS imaging sensors and\n\
    image-processing techniques for differentiating diseases from other confounding\
    \ factors\nare needed. In less-developed countries, very few farmers have the\
    \ necessary skills required\nto use RS technologies in creating their prescription\
    \ maps, in the implementation of disease\nmanagement and in the site-speciﬁc fungicide\
    \ application. More research is needed in\nthe development of integrated geospatial\
    \ analytical methodologies and tools for aiding\nfarmers in the detection of different\
    \ crop diseases.\nAlthough precision agriculture technologies can aid in optimizing\
    \ crops and facili-\ntating agricultural management decisions in solving food\
    \ insecurity challenges in LMICs,\nprecision farming requires the adoption of\
    \ geospatial technology and a large amount of\nhigh-resolution spatiotemporal\
    \ data. A lack of skills to use GIS and RS in LMICs can be\naugmented by the dissemination\
    \ and the transfer of practical geospatial technologies from\ndeveloped countries\
    \ [51]. However, considerable investments in ICT infrastructure are\nneeded for\
    \ the effective adaptation of precision agricultural approaches in LMICs.\nSoil\
    \ fertility assessment is considered one of the most important indicators of precision\n\
    farming and for the sustainable use of agricultural lands according to their potential.\
    \ This\nrequires a comprehensive soil information system. However, according to\
    \ Abdelfattah and\nKumar [32], much of the world has very poor coverage of soil\
    \ quality data. In LMICs, the\nfragmentation of agricultural land into small uneconomical\
    \ plots and unsustainable farming\npractices is happening at a much higher rate.\
    \ In such a rapidly changing environment, the\npotential of active remote sensors\
    \ to determine soil quality requires further research.\nOther obstacles to the\
    \ use and adoption of GIS and RS in agriculture include a lack of\ncommonly agreed\
    \ data interoperability standards. Though there is increasing availability\nof\
    \ spatial data usage in LMICs, many of these data are prone to error and are often\
    \ collected\nand stored with different spatial units, formats, metadata, time,\
    \ and space intervals. This\nmakes some data unusable, prevents spatial data integration,\
    \ and hinders a uniﬁed analysis\nof data, especially those collected from multiple\
    \ sensors and platforms. A need exists on\ndeveloping standardized guidelines\
    \ for agriculture spatial data. Training for researchers,\npractitioners, and\
    \ farmers on how to collect quality and accurate spatial data that can\nbe usable\
    \ in multi-platform systems is paramount. Developing spatial data repositories\n\
    with better interoperability can enable data integration and improve the efﬁciency\
    \ of data\nanalyses. In this regard, crowdsourced data collection would be a promising\
    \ contribution\nto developing cost-effective agri-spatial data repositories.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper has explored various ways GIS technology has been integrated\
    \ into agricul-\nture to improve agriculture decisions and policymaking. GIS and\
    \ RS technologies present\nbetter methods for the analysis of spatial factors\
    \ that affect agricultural production as\ncompared to approaches where geographically\
    \ explicit data are absent. If well exploited,\nthe spatially integrated knowledge\
    \ provided by GIS and RS can be applied to enhance\nagriculture policy and evidence-based\
    \ interventions geared towards improving agricul-\nture sustainability. Though\
    \ GIS technologies provide a promising pathway for improving\nagronomic practices,\
    \ they remain underexploited in many LMICs where a dire need for\nenhancing agriculture\
    \ and food production practices is most needed. For LMIC govern-\nments and farmers\
    \ to better exploit the beneﬁt of GIS and RS technologies, there is a need\nfor\
    \ an increased level of awareness and potential use of spatial data related to\
    \ agriculture.\nFurther advances in geoinformatics techniques and computing infrastructure\
    \ will allow\na more collaborative framework amongst scientists, policymakers,\
    \ researchers, extension\npersonnel, crop consultants, and farm equipment and\
    \ chemical dealers with practical guide-\nlines for effective management of crop\
    \ yield estimations, soil fertility, cropping pattern and\nmonitoring, drought\
    \ risks, and fertilizer and weed management.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n\
    11 of 15\nIn enhancing evidence-based agriculture policy, government and policymakers\
    \ would\nrequire hard evidence that brings a clear understanding of the complexity\
    \ and interconnect-\nedness of factors affecting agriculture productivity. This\
    \ would in turn enable designing\nconcrete intervention strategies. Additionally,\
    \ a broad spectrum of stakeholders and\npractitioners in the agriculture sector\
    \ would need location-speciﬁc agricultural data in\nimplementing a wide array\
    \ of decisions that improve agricultural production potential.\nEqually, smallholder\
    \ farmers would require synthesized information to empower them not\nonly to make\
    \ evidence-informed decisions but also to implement practicable activities that\n\
    increase agricultural productivity. This raises the demand for GIS integration\
    \ in agriculture\npolicy formulation and implementation.\nGIS and RS technologies\
    \ provide a big potential in the assessment, storage, processing, and\nproduction\
    \ of agriculture data. The data could be useful in precision agriculture, site-specific\n\
    farming, and disease detection, among others, all geared toward improving agriculture\
    \ food\nproduction and food security issues. Unfortunately, the lack of quality\
    \ spatial data in many\nlocal governments has continued to undermine decision-making,\
    \ policy formulation and the\neffectiveness in their implementation. Where such\
    \ data exists, there is a generally lack of\nskills on the use of GIS and RS spatial\
    \ analytical techniques. Achieving spatially integrated\nagriculture policies\
    \ demands comprehensive, up-to-date spatial datasets and better methods\nthat\
    \ combine and analyze complex data from various sources to produce useful information.\n\
    This would necessitate national as well as local governments to adopt methods,\
    \ strategies,\nand techniques that facilitate the collection and analysis of diverse\
    \ agricultural datasets in\nproviding comprehensive insights to policymakers,\
    \ planners, farmers, and a broad spectrum of\nstakeholders in the agriculture\
    \ sector. GIS thus provides a promising pathway for the acquisition\nof comprehensive,\
    \ up-to-date spatial databases and better spatial analysis methods that are\n\
    capable of analyzing complex data to produce useful information. If properly adopted\
    \ and\nimplemented, GIS can enhance the spatial decision support system in improving\
    \ the efficiency\nand effectiveness of agriculture policy formulation and planning.\
    \ Nonetheless, policy change\ncan guide and catalyze actions but requires public\
    \ and political will to actualize it. Thus, the\nadoption of GIS technology in\
    \ policymaking would require local government to commit public\nfunds to set up\
    \ the required software, hardware, supportive infrastructure, and training of\n\
    staff to use them. Future studies can focus on how GIS and RS technology could\
    \ promote a\ncollaborative framework amongst scientists, policymakers, researchers,\
    \ extension agriculture\nofficers in promoting sustainable, and climate-smart\
    \ farming practices, especially in LMICs.\n6. Limitations of the Study\nThe results\
    \ of this study are purely based on the 40 articles spanning 10 years\n(2010–2021)\
    \ and the learning obtained from them. As a result, we might not have in-\ncluded\
    \ some signiﬁcant research papers published in earlier years. However, the purpose\n\
    of this review was to analyze the most recent trends and relevant publications\
    \ in the appli-\ncation of GIS in agriculture. For this reason, we argue that\
    \ the 40 papers are comprehensive,\nand it is unlikely that the content of previously\
    \ published papers would have substantially\naltered our ﬁndings. Furthermore,\
    \ the selection criteria only included peer-reviewed pa-\npers. However, reﬂections\
    \ on GIS methodologies are sometimes published in books or grey\nliterature since\
    \ they have more space for in-depth reﬂections. To reduce this limitation, we\n\
    formulated our search string to include a broad range of the most relevant terms\
    \ of interest\nin this study. In addition, we performed the search in the largest\
    \ indexed databases of\nSCOPUS, BASE, CORE, and Clarivate. To account for signiﬁcant\
    \ papers that might have not\nbeen indexed in these databases, we also included\
    \ the search results from Google Scholar.\nNotwithstanding these few limitations,\
    \ the insights provided in this review provide valu-\nable information and knowledge\
    \ on GIS and RS application in enhancing evidence-based\npolicy interventions\
    \ for enhancing agriculture sustainability, as well as identifying barriers\n\
    to their application in the LMIC context.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 9974\n12 of\

    Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control and the extensive use of fossil
    fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate global warming and harm
    the environment. Along with the rapid population growth and the concomitant increase
    in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table and energy is becoming a
    must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In this context, Smart Agriculture
    (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages ICT (Information and Communication
    Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while enhancing crops’ yields. In this
    paper, we present an integral SA solution that leverages cost-effectiveness .
    Commercial solutions are costly and thus become impossible to adopt by small and
    medium farmers. Our solution revolves around three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering
    promotes optimal usage and conservation of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via
    real-time data collection and monitoring using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of
    Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration promotes energy-efficient agriculture
    by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation
    to promote good crops quality and quantity without harming the soil and the water-table
    ecosystems. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm
    testbed. The results have shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the
    amount of water consumption (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%.
    Finally, our solution is open-source and can be easily adopted and adapted by
    other researchers to promote the setting of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for
    water-table usage, especially in arid and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart

    basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans use water for industrial purposes,
    sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades, the annual water withdrawal ranged
    between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters per year, out of which 69 % is
    used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of this water is wasted because of
    inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most arid and sub-Saharan countries,
    agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer of fresh water, especially after
    launching the Green Plan program in April 2008 [2]. This program aims to promote
    agriculture as an efficient sector capable of advancing the economy, fighting
    poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas efficiently and sustainably.
    Within the framework of this program, the government provided many facilities
    and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated agriculture to provide enough
    basic food for local consumption and export promotion programs. However, the level
    of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains very low. In addition, investors
    in the irrigated agricultural projects started sounding alarms of severe depletion
    of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the lack of a cost-effective real-time data
    collection in irrigation systems in farming fields that will enable them to benefit
    from the advanced modern technologies. There is a need to develop a cost-effective
    and sustainable data acquisition system for smart agriculture applications in
    sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient, and smart agriculture. The system
    should use renewable energy and the latest Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural environment. When combined
    with reasonable control and management and data analytics, the data acquisition
    system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural productivity and
    improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the traditional methods
    of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water reservoirs and resort
    to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy. Smart agriculture (SA)
    exploits modern management systems to rationalize water consumption and adopt
    renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering the agricultural sector
    eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral and cost-effective
    SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) perspective [4],
    our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors Network (WSNs) monitor,
    in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g., weather and soil conditions,
    2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric appliances such as water
    pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform for real-time data storage,
    processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic Control module decides on
    monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time acquired differences between
    desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our open-source software solution
    for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We built our cost-effective sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos. Finally, we leveraged an
    existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED [5]. In this paper, and
    by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy integration, and open-source
    ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute towards the smooth penetration
    of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan countries. We are further
    envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone for establishing a
    dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing) platform [6] to collect
    real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which falls under the big data
    category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity, and Variety) [7], and
    along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously assist in promoting
    eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are as follows: We present
    a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general architecture for a Smart
    Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt and adapt for further
    testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source software and leverage
    Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing. We demonstrate
    the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors and actuators
    using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show how integrating
    renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting our solution
    in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that by adopting
    fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption by
    up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and the
    related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and design
    are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    volume analyses and compares data practices across several fields through the
    analysis of specific cases of data journeys. It brings together leading scholars
    in the philosophy, history and social studies of science to achieve two goals:
    tracking the travel of data across different spaces, times and domains of research
    practice; and documenting how such journeys affect the use of data as evidence
    and the knowledge being produced.  The volume captures the opportunities, challenges
    and concerns involved in making data move from the sites in which they are originally
    produced to sites where they can be integrated with other data, analysed and re-used
    for a variety of purposes. The in-depth study of data journeys provides the necessary
    ground to examine disciplinary, geographical and historical differences and similarities
    in data management, processing and interpretation, thus identifying the key conditions
    of possibility for the widespread data sharing associated with Big and Open Data.  The
    chapters are ordered in sections that broadly correspond to different stages of
    the journeys of data, from their generation to the legitimisation of their use
    for specific purposes. Additionally, the preface to the volume provides a variety
    of alternative “roadmaps” aimed to serve the different interests and entry points
    of readers; and the introduction provides a substantive overview of what data
    journeys can teach about the methods and epistemology of research. Editors and

    \ Phenomics and Business \nCycle Analysis\nMarcel Boumans and Sabina Leonelli\n\
    Abstract This chapter considers and compares the ways in which two types of data,\
    \ \neconomic observations and phenotypic data in plant science, are prepared for\
    \ use as \nevidence for claims about phenomena such as business cycles and gene-\
    \ environment \ninteractions. We focus on what we call “cleaning by clustering”\
    \ procedures, and \ninvestigate the principles underpinning this kind of cleaning.\
    \ These cases illustrate the \nepistemic significance of preparing data for use\
    \ as evidence in both the social and \nnatural sciences. At the same time, the\
    \ comparison points to differences and similarities \nbetween data cleaning practices,\
    \ which are grounded in the characteristics of the objects \nof interests as well\
    \ as the conceptual commitments, community standards and research \ntools used\
    \ by economics and plant science towards producing and validating claims.\n1 \
    \ Introduction: Preparing Big Data for Analysis\nBig data cannot be interpreted\
    \ without extensive and laborious preparation, includ-\ning various stages of\
    \ processing and ordering to make it possible for data to be dis-\nseminated and\
    \ subjected to analysis. Several chapters in this volume – including \nHalfmann’s\
    \ on sampling in oceanography, Karaca on data acquisition in particle \nphysics\
    \ and Hoeppe on sharing observations in astronomy  - stress the decisive \nimpact\
    \ that such preparation practices have on the subsequent journeys of data and\
    \ \nthe use of data as evidence for claims about phenomena. In this chapter we\
    \ discuss \nthe epistemological significance of yet another practice of data preparation:\
    \ data \ncleaning, that is the efforts involved in formatting, manipulating and\
    \ visualising \ndata so that they are sufficiently tractable to be amenable for\
    \ analysis.\nM. Boumans (*) \nUtrecht University School of Economics, Utrecht\

    80\nThe cleaning strategies that we aim to discuss are not focused on scrubbing\
    \ and \nscraping dirt away, but rather on tidying up, sorting and ordering. In\
    \ everyday life as \nin data practices, tidying up can be done in a variety of\
    \ different ways depending on \nexisting habits and future requirements. In what\
    \ follows, we focus on two strategies \nfor tidying up data which both rely, in\
    \ different ways, on the clustering of objects \ninto groups. The first strategy\
    \ is to get rid of smudges and flecks by arranging \nobjects so that unruly bits\
    \ are less visible, and the eye is drawn to the more orderly – \ncleaner - parts\
    \ of the ensemble. We exemplify this strategy through the analysis of \ndata cleaning\
    \ practices in economics, and specifically in relation to business cycle \nanalysis,\
    \ where data consist of observations of journalists, business annals, and \nsocial\
    \ and economic statistical time-series. The second strategy is to put everything\
    \ \nin boxes and store them some place out of sight, placing labels on each box\
    \ to be \nable to retrieve its contents when needed (the more boxes and objects\
    \ one has, of \ncourse, the more complex the labels will need to be).1 We exemplify\
    \ this strategy \nthrough the analysis of data cleaning practices in biology,\
    \ and specifically the han-\ndling of phenomic data about plants, where data include\
    \ images and measurements \ndocumenting the morphology, physiology and behaviour\
    \ of organisms and their \nenvironments.\nWe compare a case from the natural sciences\
    \ (biology) with one from social sci-\nences (economics) in some detail to exemplify\
    \ the complexity of the research prac-\ntices involved, which mirrors the complexity\
    \ of the phenomena under study in both \nareas. While the conceptual commitments,\
    \ community standards and research tools \nused by economics and biology are starkly\
    \ different, in both cases data cleaning and \nsubsequent analysis involve bringing\
    \ together voluminous datasets of diverse types \nand formats, generated by a\
    \ broad range of heterogeneous sources. The projected \nvalue of these data as\
    \ evidence for scientific claims grows with aggregation: the \nmore data analysts\
    \ are able to link together and consider as a single body of evi-\ndence, the\
    \ more sophisticated and reliable the resulting insights are expected to be.\n\
    The chapter is organised as follows. In the first section, we examine the work\
    \ \nrequired to create meaningful clusters from these forms of big data, and the\
    \ extent \nto which data cleaning transforms datasets. In section two we draw\
    \ on Mary \nDouglas’s seminal analysis of dirt and impurity, in which she argued\
    \ that cleaning \nis not about removal but about ordering, to identify a common\
    \ strategy used by \nresearchers in both cases, which we call cleaning by clustering.\
    \ After discussing \nthis general approach, we note how the specific mechanisms\
    \ and tools used to enact \nthis strategy differ considerably in the two domains\
    \ of practice. In economics, \ncleaning by clustering is largely a question of\
    \ exercising visual judgement grounded \non principles similar to the Gestalt\
    \ principles, thus arranging data in ways that are \naesthetically appealing and\
    \ intuitively intelligible to the analyst. This strategy goes \na long way towards\
    \ facilitating data mining, for instance through the construction of \n1 This\
    \ approach to cleaning is heavily built on the strategies of packaging, curating\
    \ and labelling \nexplored by Leonelli (2011, 2016). Contrary to data packaging\
    \ in her previous studies, however, \ntidying up is not primarily aimed at making\
    \ data portable across contexts, but rather at making it \npossible for data to\
    \ be analysed and interpreted.\nM. Boumans and S. Leonelli\n81\ndata models that\
    \ highlight meaningful correlations and direct analysts towards spe-\ncific interpretations.\
    \ By the same token, this form of clustering is difficult to undo, \nleading to\
    \ a situation where the aesthetic criteria employed to arrange the data are \n\
    traded off with the ways in which the data could be used as evidence. In plant\
    \ phe-\nnomics, cleaning by clustering is instead guided by the attempt to define\
    \ a “land-\nscape” for the re-purposing of data: a set of conditions, in other\
    \ words, through \nwhich researchers may be able to re-use data for new goals.2\
    \ The priority in this case \nis not achieving visual intelligibility alone, but\
    \ rather the creation of data visualisa-\ntion and retrieval tools that enable\
    \ users to disaggregate data clusters when needed \nto confront new research questions.\
    \ This enables researchers to trace the origin of \nthe relevant data journeys,\
    \ and evaluate the reliability and appropriateness of every \nstep of “cleaning”\
    \ in light of novel situations of inquiry within which data may be \nre-purposed.\
    \ We are particularly interested in identifying the principles that guide \ndata\
    \ cleaning activities in these cases, and the conceptual, material and social\
    \ cir-\ncumstances within which these principles are grounded and through which\
    \ they \noriginate. To this aim, in section three we explore the relation between\
    \ data cleaning \npractices and how data are subsequently moved and used. Comparing\
    \ our two cases \npoints to significant differences between data practices, which\
    \ are grounded in the \nnature of the objects of interest as well as in the conceptual\
    \ commitments, commu-\nnity standards and research tools used by economics and\
    \ plant science towards pro-\nducing and validating claims. It also points to\
    \ the difficulties experienced by data \nanalysts in providing general principles\
    \ of cleanliness with regard to research data, \nas exemplified by the recent\
    \ debate around “tidy data” in computational data sci-\nence, which we discuss\
    \ in our closing section.\n2  Cleaning Data: Empirical Cases from Plant Science\
    \ \nand Economics\nOur starting point is a close look at two cases of “data cleaning”\
    \ taken from eco-\nnomics and plant science, respectively. The cases exemplify\
    \ some of the most \nsophisticated forms of data processing in each field, aiming\
    \ to encompass very dif-\nferent types and formats of data coming from a wide\
    \ variety of sources, which can \nonly be considered as a single body of evidence\
    \ thanks to laborious processing. The \neconomic case, concerning the generation\
    \ of quantitative facts about the business \ncycle at the National Bureau of Economic\
    \ Research in the 1940s, was selected for \ntwo reasons. On the one hand, this\
    \ post-war research at the NBER is exemplary for \nmany current practices of data\
    \ preparation in economics, and on the other hand this \npractice was described\
    \ so explicitly and in such great detail in a publication, \nMeasuring Business\
    \ Cycle (1946), that it enables and ensures insight and under-\n2 The landscape\
    \ may include data collection strategies, repositories and visualisation tools\
    \ enabling \nresearchers to retrieve, compare and analyse data coming from a variety\
    \ of sources.\nFrom Dirty Data to Tidy Facts: Clustering Practices in Plant Phenomics\
    \ and Business…\n82\nstanding of this specific clustering practice. The plant\
    \ science case, concerning the \nprocessing of phenotypic data in plant phenomics,\
    \ constitutes one of the most dis-\ncussed examples of complex data processing\
    \ in contemporary biology, with several \nongoing debates documenting the rationale\
    \ and strategies used to make data usable \nfor further analysis. Below, we focus\
    \ on the discussions surrounding the identifica-\ntion of essential data and related\
    \ standards (“minimal information”) for this kind of \nresearch.\n2.1  Empirical\
    \ Case: Measuring Business Cycles\nFounded in 1920, the National Bureau of Economic\
    \ Research (NBER) is a private, \nnon-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated\
    \ to conducting economic research \nand to disseminating research findings among\
    \ academics, public policy makers, and \nbusiness professionals.3 The object of\
    \ the NBER is “to ascertain and to present to \nthe public important economic\
    \ facts and their interpretation in a scientific and \nimpartial manner” (Burns\
    \ and Mitchell 1946, p. v). Wesley C. Mitchell, the first \ndirector of the NBER\
    \ till 1945, was well-known for his contributions to the empiri-\ncal analysis\
    \ of business cycles.4 The NBER is not a statistical office or bureau that \n\
    aims at collecting economic and social data, but instead aims to analyse existing\
    \ \neconomic and social statistics, in this case to “measure business conditions.”\
    \ These \nstatistics were data of various aspects of economic and business life\
    \ and came from \nvarious different sources. An 11 page long appendix of Measuring\
    \ Business Cycle \n(1946) list these statistics such as of industrial production,\
    \ freight, sales, milk used \nin factory production, transit rides, railway passengers\
    \ miles, wholesale prices, total \nincome payments, employment, bank debits, electric\
    \ power production, payrolls, \nbusiness failures, from organisations such as\
    \ Federal Reserve, Interstate Commerce \nCommission, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic\
    \ Commerce, Railroad Companies, \nBureau of Labor Statistics, Chicago Board of\
    \ Trade, and Bureau of Foreign and \nDomestic Commerce.\nThe book Measuring Business\
    \ Cycles (1946) was the result of 20 years of empir-\nical business studies at\
    \ the Bureau under the supervision of Mitchell. The aim was \nto identify and\
    \ establish facts about the business cycles, which could be used to test \nexisting\
    \ business cycle theories. Burns and Mitchell stated that theoretical work on\
    \ \nbusiness cycles was “often highly suggestive; yet rest so much upon simplifying\
    \ \nassumptions and is so imperfectly tested for conformity to experience that,\
    \ for our \npurposes, the conclusions must serve mainly as hypotheses” (p. 4).\
    \ At the same \ntime, they observed that “satisfactory tests cannot be made unless\
    \ hypotheses have \nbeen framed with an eye to testing, and unless, observations\
    \ upon many economic \n3 See the NBER website, http://www.nber.org\n4 See Morgan\
    \ 1990, pp.  44–56, for a more detailed background of the NBER and Mitchell’s\
    \ \napproach.\nM. Boumans and S. Leonelli\n83\nactivities have been made in a\
    \ uniform manner” (p. 4). Although theories were seen \nas “incomplete in coverage”\
    \ and “highly suggestive,” they were not “put aside” but \nused “as hypotheses\
    \ concerning what activities and what relations among them are \nworth studying.\
    \ In that way they will be of inestimable value in his factual inqui-\nries” (p. 10).\
    \ Hence the point of departure for data analysis was not a theory of the \nbusiness\
    \ cycle but a very general definition covering commonly accepted character-\n\
    istics of the business cycles:\nBusiness cycles are a type of fluctuation found\
    \ in the aggregate economic activity of nations \nthat organize their work mainly\
    \ in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions \noccurring at about\
    \ the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general \n\
    recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of\
    \ the next \ncycle; this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic; in\
    \ duration business cycles \nvary from more than one year to ten or twelve years;\
    \ they are not divisible into shorter \ncycles of similar character with amplitudes\
    \ approximating their own. (Burns and Mitchell \n1946, p. 3)\nThis working definition\
    \ was supposed to list the observable characteristics of a \n“distinct species\
    \ of economic phenomena” (p. 3), that is the business cycle. This \ndefinition\
    \ focused on what should be measured, such as the average duration of the \ncycle.\
    \ To achieve this aim, all kinds of questions raised by this definition had first\
    \ to \nbe answered.5\nTo understand which principles of clustering were used in\
    \ this case of business \ncycle measurement, we need to have a closer look at\
    \ the four implicit assumptions \nmade within this definition. The first assumption\
    \ is that the cyclical turns of differ-\nent processes are concentrated around\
    \ certain points in time. The second assump-\ntion is that the business cycle\
    \ is not a periodic but a recurrent process, a “regularity” \nthat is different\
    \ from “seasonal variations, random change, and secular trends” \n(p. 6). Another\
    \ assumption of the definition is that business cycles run in a continu-\nous\
    \ round, “no intervals are admitted between one phase and its successor, or \n\
    between the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next” (p. 7). And the last\
    \ \nassumption is the duration of the cycle, somewhere between 1  year and 10\
    \ or \n12 years.\nThe main problem for analysts is that business indexes and time\
    \ series do not \nshow “cyclical patterns” that are “sweeping smoothly upward\
    \ from depressions to a \nsingle peak of prosperity and the declining steadily\
    \ to a new trough” (p. 7), and so \na business cycle has to be identified from\
    \ an irregular process, where the movements \nare interrupted by others in the\
    \ opposite direction, and where one may see double or \ntriple peaks and troughs.\
    \ What therefore is needed are criteria to identify the char-\nacteristics of\
    \ the business cycles, such as “what reversals in direction mark the end \nof\
    \ a cyclical phase” (p. 8). Crucial to our analysis is the fact that such criteria\
    \ cannot \nbe derived from any (business cycle) theory,6 but rather they relate\
    \ to aesthetic \n5 Such as, for instance: How large or small does a nation have\
    \ to be to have a business cycle, or is \nit an international phenomenon? How\
    \ far back in time can business cycles be traced? What is the \nmost appropriate\
    \ level of aggregation? Which economic activities should be included?\n6 See Bogen\
    \ and Woodward (1988) for a similar, more general claim about the incompleteness\
    \ of \ntheories in this respect.\nFrom Dirty Data to Tidy Facts: Clustering Practices\
    \ in Plant Phenomics and Business…\n84\njudgements based on visual displays of\
    \ the data. In other words, certain smooth and \nsimple shapes turn out to be\
    \ used as tools to process and visualise the data. The \napproach is based on\
    \ pattern recognition, described by Burns and Mitchell (1946, \np. 8n) as “the\
    \ source of all true knowledge”, but nevertheless it is required to be as \nobjective\
    \ as possible. Indeed, these criteria are presented as “a ‘brake’ on an inves-\n\
    tigator’s pattern sense which […] may lead to mischievous fictions” (p. 8n).\n\
    Burns and Mitchell emphasized that the cyclical pattern can be seen “only by the\
    \ \neye of the mind” (p. 12). “What we literally observe is not a congeries of\
    \ economic \nactivities rising and falling in unison, but changes in readings\
    \ taken from many \nrecording instruments of varying reliability” (p. 14). To\
    \ “see” the business cycle “in \nthe mind’s eye,” these recordings have “to be\
    \ decomposed for our purposes; then \none set of components must be put together\
    \ in a new fashion” (p. 14).\nWe conceive business cycles to consist of roughly\
    \ synchronous movements in many activi-\nties. To determine whether this thought\
    \ symbol represents experience or fantasy, our mea-\nsures of the cyclical behavior\
    \ characteristics of many activities must be assembled into the \nend products\
    \ of which our definition is the blueprint. In statistical jargon, time-series\
    \ analy-\nsis must be followed by a time-series synthesis. (Burns and Mitchell\
    \ 1946, p. 17)\nThe idea is the decomposition of the time series into cyclical,\
    \ secular, seasonal \nand random movements, but the “isolation of cyclical fluctuations”\
    \ was considered \nto be a “highly uncertain operation” (p. 37), particularly\
    \ if it is done in a “mechani-\ncal manner”. The components cannot be segregated\
    \ without considerable testing \nand experimenting by skilled technicians. “There\
    \ is always danger that the statisti-\ncal operations performed on the original\
    \ data may lead an investigator to bury real \nproblems and worry about false\
    \ ones” (p. 38).7\nMost of the analysis was in the determination of cyclical timing.\
    \ It had become \nclear that the data needed to be adjusted for – i.e., cleaned\
    \ from – seasonal variations \n“to be more useful in explaining business cycles\
    \ than would measures made from \nhighly fabricated data” (p. 43). We therefore\
    \ briefly focus on this aspect of the busi-\nness cycle analysis, to show how\
    \ much it was a combination of “hunch and judg-\nment” (p. 44) and mechanical\
    \ methods, which results were evaluated based on their \nvisual displays.\nTwo\
    \ methods were used, one consisted in taking averages of the original figures\
    \ \nfor each months, which were adjusted for secular trend; and the other entailed\
    \ tak-\ning a 12-month moving average of the original figures, placing each average\
    \ in the \nseventh month of shifting 12-month intervals. The rationale for both\
    \ methods are \nthe assumptions that “random components of a series [will] cancel\
    \ one another” and \nthat “the process of averaging will tend also to make the\
    \ cyclical component of a \nseries sum to zero” (p. 47).\nWhen the data was adjusted\
    \ for seasonal variations, the next problem was the \ndating of cyclical fluctuations.\
    \ Therefore the data was plotted upon a semi-logarith-\n7 See Boumans 2015 for\
    \ a more detailed account of measurement, which sees measurement as a \nconsidered\
    \ balance between mechanical objectivity and expert judgement.\nM. Boumans and\
    \ S. Leonelli\n85\nmic chart (typically about 7 feet long) such that the whole\
    \ record was studied in this \ngraphic form. As far as possible the scales were\
    \ kept uniform.\nThe basic criterion for distinguishing the three types of movements,\
    \ that is the \ncyclical, secular and erratic movements, was their duration. Secular\
    \ trends were \nconceived as drifts that persist in a given direction for a few\
    \ decades. Erratic move-\nments, the “saw-tooth contour” (p. 57) were supposed\
    \ to cover no longer than a few \nmonths. But even with this basic criterion,\
    \ the judgments were often difficult:\nWhen specific cycles are made doubtful\
    \ by random movements, we smooth the data by \nmoving averages and base judgments\
    \ upon the curve of moving averages. When the secular \ntrend rises sharply, we\
    \ allow brief and mild declines to count as contractions of specific \ncycles.\
    \ Similarly, when the secular trend falls sharply, brief and mild rises are counted\
    \ a \nspecific-cycle expansions. (Burns and Mitchell 1946, p. 57)\nOnce the cycles\
    \ had been distinguished the NBER researchers proceeded with \nthe dating of the\
    \ turning points. The idea is to take the highest and lowest points of \nthe plotted\
    \ curves as the dates of the cyclical turns. But often it is not clear to decide\
    \ \nwhich points these are, for example when erratic movements are prominent in\
    \ the \nvicinity of a cyclical turn. Then all kinds of checks or averages have\
    \ to be consid-\nered to arrive at a determination.\nOur methods of determining\
    \ specific cycles make no pretensions to elegance. Since no fast \nline separates\
    \ erratic or episodic movements from specific cycles, or erratic turns from \n\
    cyclical turns, there is ample opportunity for vagaries of judgment. At times\
    \ our rules fail to \nyield a clear-cut decision. At times the members of our\
    \ statistical staff disagree in their \nefforts to apply the rules to a given\
    \ series. Our experience indicates that this difficulty can-\nnot be removed by\
    \ multiplying rules. (Burns and Mitchell 1946, p. 64)\nThe judgment is instead\
    \ based on a consensus of three persons who have worked \nindependently on marking\
    \ off the cycle. Once arrived at this consensus, the whole \nprocess is audited\
    \ by an “experienced member of the staff” (p. 64) (Fig. 1).\n2.2  Empirical Case:\
    \ Processing and Interoperability \nRequirements for Imaging Data in Plant Phenomics\n\
    Plant phenotyping involves analysing plant trait data with the aim to study develop-\n\
    ment and gene-environment interactions. It emerged in the 1960s with an initial\
    \ \nemphasis on quantitative analysis, which was later broadened to imaging data\
    \ \nobtained via high-throughput experiments performed in fields, glasshouses,\
    \ and/or \nlaboratories. Such imaging data, and the accompanying observations\
    \ about the con-\nditions under which the images were obtained, now constitute\
    \ the most coveted type \nof data in this field, with increasingly sophisticated\
    \ tools being developed for their \nvisualisation and automated analysis. This\
    \ shift of emphasis on complex data for-\nmats proceeded in parallel to the broadening\
    \ of the term “phenotyping” to include \nany type of morphological variability\
    \ within organisms, thus encompassing not \nonly the immediately visible features\
    \ of organisms, but also (1) features of tissues, \nFrom Dirty Data to Tidy Facts:\
    \ Clustering Practices in Plant Phenomics and Business…\n86\nFig. 1 Example chart\

    \ 4)\nproteins, metabolic pathways and other aspects only accessible through intervention\
    \ \nand specialised imaging techniques; and (2) the ways in which such features\
    \ vary \nacross environments that range from laboratories to glasshouses, field\
    \ trials and the \n“wild” – which involves collecting data on the soil, climate,\
    \ other organisms and \nmicrobiome with which plants interact. In the words of\
    \ prominent contributors to \nthe field, phenotyping – also called “phenomics” –\
    \ “broadened its focus from the \ninitial characterization of single-plant traits\
    \ in controlled conditions towards ‘real-\nlife’ applications of robust field\
    \ techniques in plant plots and canopies” (Walter \net al. 2015). Importantly\
    \ for our analysis, this shift in the conceptualisation of phe-\nnotypic traits\
    \ made them much less obviously identifiable as concrete descriptors. \nCollecting\
    \ data about the size of a leaf or the structure of a metabolic pathway is not\
    \ \nsimply a matter of observation, but rather is informed by a rich conceptual\
    \ apparatus \ndefining what counts as leaf surface and metabolism. Thus, just\
    \ as much as business \ncycles are no pure theoretical constructs, phenotypes\
    \ are no ‘brute facts’ about the \nworld: in both cases, empirical and theoretical\
    \ considerations remain firmly inter-\ntwined, and affect researchers’ approach\
    \ to data processing and interpretation.\nA key component of contemporary phenomics,\
    \ and the reason why it is regarded \nas generating knowledge that can underpin\
    \ and guide agricultural production, is a \nholistic characterisation of plant\
    \ performance, which involves the employment of \nseveral investigative methods\
    \ and the generation and analysis of a wide variety of \ndata types. These include,\
    \ for instance, multispectral and thermographic imaging of \nplant growth, which\
    \ is often carried out within so-called “smart glasshouses” in an \nautomated\
    \ fashion (by robots or conveyor belts that transport the plants to various \n\
    imaging chambers, multiple times per day, over an extended period of time). \n\
    M. Boumans and S. Leonelli\n87\nPhotographs and measurements are produced that\
    \ document how plants develop, \nhow their leaves and roots change, and how they\
    \ respond to external stimuli.\nCleaning such images for analysis involves judgements\
    \ around the quality and \nresolution of the photograph, the lighting and background\
    \ conditions, the position \nin which plants have been captured and the extent\
    \ and clarity to which relevant \nleaves and roots show in the picture. The quantity\
    \ of images generated through any \none experiment makes it hard for researchers\
    \ to do such work manually, and yet it \nis hard to fully automate due to the\
    \ large amount of know-how and theoretical com-\nmitments involved in judging\
    \ image quality – encompassing familiarity with the \nplants and their full life-cycle,\
    \ expectations around how plants may respond to envi-\nronmental conditions, existing\
    \ conceptualisations of plant development and growth, \nand assumptions around\
    \ which environmental and morphological elements need to \nbe valued and prioritised\
    \ over others.\nAnother popular type of phenomic data is acquired through top-view\
    \ imaging of \nthe plant canopy in the field, which can be performed by humans\
    \ in helicopters, \nrobots or remote-controlled drones. These photographs can\
    \ be analysed to measure \nleaf greenness, via tools such as the Normalised Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index, or \nplant biomass and growth in the area under scrutiny.\
    \ Again, while some basic \nparameters can be established for what counts as a\
    \ “bad image” and which elements \nof each image may be classified as “noise”,\
    \ cleaning such images involves expert \nassessment based on detailed knowledge\
    \ of the characteristics and patterns of \ngrowth of the plants at hand. An example\
    \ (Fig. 2) is an imaging study of soy-bean \nfields to determine patterns of growth,\
    \ in which researchers prepare images for fur-\nther analysis (in their own words,\
    \ “classify” the images) through models that are \nmanually trained at every step\
    \ to respond to the traits of interest in the beans (Xavier \net al. 2017).\n\
    Given the sensitivity of phenomic studies to local conditions and the conceptual\
    \ \npreferences and know-how of specific researchers, consensus around how to\
    \ clean \ndata is hard to achieve. Nevertheless, such consensus is highly valued\
    \ and sought \nfor, as it enables researchers to compare results obtained across\
    \ species, field types \nand environmental conditions. One attempt towards establishing\
    \ general standards \nfor data collection and processing is the Minimal Information\
    \ About Plant \nPhenotypic Experiments, or MIAPPE. MIAPPE is part of a broader\
    \ set of “minimal \ninformation about data” movement now recognized and coordinated\
    \ by the FAIR \nsharing international initiative for reusable data curation.8\
    \ This is an attempt to stan-\ndardize the practices and variables required to\
    \ tidy up data formatting and analysis \nenough to make data searchable, visualisable\
    \ and retrievable through digital means. \nThe idea of “minimal” information is\
    \ meant to foster an evaluation of which contex-\ntual information is most important\
    \ to data interpretation, resulting in as small a set \n8 See https://fairsharing.org/collection/MIBBI.\
    \ Among the first incarnations of the movement, and \nnow highly successful standards\
    \ in their own right, were the Minimal Information About a \nMicroarray Experiment,\
    \ or MIAME (Rogers and Cambrosio 2007) and the Minimal Information \nfor Biological\
    \ and Biomedical Investigations, or MIBBI (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/\n\

    \ to phenotypic data reuse. \nSomewhat paradoxically, within MIAPPE this aspiration\
    \ towards minimal informa-\ntion is accompanied by the wish to lose as little\
    \ information as possible about the \noriginal format of the data, the circumstances\
    \ under which they were generated, and \nthe ways in which they were processed\
    \ since. This is because the specificity of the \nprovenance and formatting of\
    \ data in each case is regarded as highly valuable by the \nplant scientists using\
    \ such data for their own research, a requirement that research-\ners and engineers\
    \ involved in the development of MIAPPE take seriously: “We had \nto allow for\
    \ differences that occur between particular types of plant experiments, \ne.g.\
    \ performed in different growth facilities. This is reflected in a varying set\
    \ of \nattributes recommended in MIAPPE” (Ćwiek-Kupczyńska et al. 2016). Indeed,\
    \ the \nM. Boumans and S. Leonelli\n89\nlist of attributes to be reported to MIAPPE\
    \ involves over 80 items, which can extend \nto over a hundred depending on the\
    \ field conditions. The basic categories are them-\nselves relatively broad, encompassing\
    \ general metadata, timing and location, bio-\nsources, environment, treatments,\
    \ experimental design, observed variables and as \nmuch information as possible\
    \ on sample collection, processing and management – a \nfar cry from the minimalism\
    \ that the MIAPPE criteria were expected to exemplify.\nIt is useful to consider\
    \ a couple of the simplest examples from this list. Take for \ninstance the item\
    \ “location and timing of an experiment”. Here MIAPPE developers \nnote that “depending\
    \ on the nature of the study and scientific objectives, different \ninitial time\
    \ points might be crucial—sowing date or transfer date, treatment applica-\ntion\
    \ time, etc. The duration of particular stages is also important.” (Ćwiek-\nKupczyńska\
    \ et al. 2016, p. 3). Thus, even a relatively straightforward measure such \n\
    as the time of the experiment turns out to be a complex and context-dependent\
    \ issue, \nfor which it is hard to establish any hard and fast boundaries to ensure\
    \ comparability \nacross different experiments.9 Another example is item “biosource” –\
    \ that is, the \nidentification of the plant material at hand. Here MIAPPE recommends\
    \ using at \nleast two attributes, one consisting of the species name as in standard\
    \ taxonomic \nclassifications, and the other consisting of the “infraspecific”\
    \ name, pointing to the \nspecific variant, accession or line in question. Complications\
    \ arise due to the types \nand history of the plant materials at hand. While the\
    \ taxonomy of plant species is, \nthough controversial, subject to international\
    \ standards, the identification and clas-\nsification of sub-species variants\
    \ is highly decentralised and context-dependent, \nwith no overarching agreement\
    \ around classification and often not even a clear \nawareness of the differences\
    \ between local systems. For example the varieties of the \nplant Manihot esculenta,\
    \ whose root cassava is a key crop in West Africa and South \nAmerica, are often\
    \ defined by the different ways in which local breeders value spe-\ncific traits\
    \ (like the humidity and colour of the root) when processing the plant for \n\
    food production. Aware of this fact, the authors point to the importance of referenc-\n\
    ing any “public collection of names”, and/or a specific experimental station or\
    \ gene-\nbank in which the variant may be stored and or the seeds may have been\
    \ sourced, \nand to which they can be physically traced. There are international\
    \ identification \nsystems for crops of commercial interest, such as the FAO/Bioversity\
    \ Multi-Crop \nPassport Descriptors, but these do not cover all possible variants.\
    \ The ways in which \ndata about specific attributes are structured in MIAPPE\
    \ conform to the ISA-Tab \nstandards for data ordering, which is widely adopted\
    \ in biology and looks as follows \n(Table 1).\nThis table aims to impose a clear\
    \ conceptual ordering of the data, resulting in \ntheir presentation in a format\
    \ and structure that is amenable to computational analy-\nsis. At the same time,\
    \ the application of the ISA-Tab standard to the specific case of \nphenotyping\
    \ is complex, as demonstrated by challenges encountered in developing \nthe so-called\
    \ “ISA-Tab Phenotyping Configuration”. This consists of a standard \nInvestigation\
    \ file, a Phenotyping Assay file describing phenotypic procedures and \nobserved\
    \ variables (according to the dozens of attributes identified by MIAPPE, \n9 See\
    \ Leonelli (2018) for an analysis of data time and its significance particularly\

    \ attributes for growth facilities and environmental infor-\nmation (Ćwiek-Kupczyńska\
    \ et al. 2016, p. 8) (Table 2).\nNotably, despite the drive towards comparability,\
    \ MIAPPE emphasizes the need \nto capture any data format in use within the relevant\
    \ scientific communities, rather \nthan attempting to impose overarching standards\
    \ on the ways in which data are \nproduced: “in our implementation of MIAPPE,\
    \ we do not restrict the format of the \nraw data in any way; it can be any custom,\
    \ platform- or device- specific format, \nincluding texts, images, binary data,\
    \ etc.” (Ćwiek-Kupczyńska et al. 2016, p. 11). At \nthe same time, MIAPPE requires\
    \ that information about data provenance (metadata) \nis reported in ways that\
    \ are comprehensive and retrievable by later data users. The \nmost stringent\
    \ MIAPPE instructions concern how to organize and display such \nmetadata:\nIf\

    \ and con-\ntextuality of data and related preparation procedures, applying MIAPPE\
    \ criteria to \nthe processing of data in the feld remains a big challenge. As\
    \ a concrete example, \nwe take the data processing performed at a leading station\
    \ for the collection of phe-\nnomics data in the UK. The North Wyke Farm Platform\
    \ is a research facility built \naround a working farm in Devon, in which researchers\
    \ can study the interactions \nbetween climate, soil, animals, plants and microbiota\
    \ in as close a setting as possi-\nble to real farming. The whole area is full\
    \ of sensors and measurement devices, \nwhich collect data at regular intervals\
    \ (15 minutes) about a variety of aspects of the \nfarm: temperature, soil composition,\
    \ humidity and rainfall, etc. The sensors are cali-\nbrated and checked in 15\
    \ huts (“monitoring cabins”) positioned around the felds, \nand the data produced\
    \ is sent wirelessly to the central computing facility based in \nthe manor house,\
    \ where researchers proceed to prepare the data, cluster them and \nstore/disseminate\
    \ them through a database. There are also three meteorological sta-\ntions that\
    \ move around the felds. An important activity besides collecting numeri-\ncal\
    \ measurements is the collection of samples (of soil, air, water, insects and\
    \ plants), \n93\nwhich are acquired manually (e.g. manual sampling device for\
    \ soil), prepared and \nstored in fridges at various temperatures).11\nResearchers\
    \ interviewed12 in North Wyke have stressed that the data collected by \nthe Farm\
    \ Platform are not yet being interpreted: this will only be possible when \nenough\
    \ longitudinal data are collected over the course of the next few years.13 This\
    \ \nmakes the task of data cleaning ever more important, since the researchers’\
    \ main \ntask at the moment is to make sure that the data collected is reliable\
    \ and clustered \nand displayed in ways that will facilitate further analysis,\
    \ and prove informative for \ninterested farmers. Cleaning the data means first\
    \ of all making them comparable and \nconsistent with other datasets generated\
    \ within the Farm, an arduous task given the \nvariety of measurements taken and\
    \ images collected. Equally important is to make \nsure that such data would be\
    \ comparable and consistent with other phenomics data \nfrom outside North Wyke.\
    \ While researchers attempt to follow criteria similar to \nthose formulated by\
    \ MIAPPE, the variability in the interpretation of the attributes \nand values\
    \ is a serious threat to automated mining and comparison among the data. \nResearchers\
    \ aim to enable analysis in the future, but caution against any automated \nsearch.\
    \ They also emphasize how the power of this evidence is in the meta-data, the\
    \ \ninformation that enables researchers to contextualize the findings and evaluate\
    \ their \nsignificance in relation to findings from other locations enacting different\
    \ epistemic \ncultures and methods.\n3  Cleaning by Clustering: The Principles\
    \ Underpinning \nData Cleaning Practices\nRenowned anthropologist Mary Douglas\
    \ provided an important argument for under-\nstanding the process of cleaning\
    \ as being not about removal, but about ordering. \nAccording to Douglas (2002),\
    \ dirt is essentially disorder: “There is no such thing as \nabsolute dirt: it\
    \ exists in the eye of the beholder. […] Dirt offends against order. \nEliminating\
    \ it is not a negative movement, but a positive effort to organize the envi-\n\
    11 The facility attracts researchers from different communities and disciplines\
    \ seeking to develop \nsustainable agriculture and ruminant production systems\
    \ http://www.nature.com/news/agriculture-\nsteps-to-sustainable-livestock-1.14796.\
    \ It is the only currently functioning facility of its kind \nworld-wide, and\
    \ the Global Farm Platform http://www.globalfarmplatform.org/ was born to \nattempt\
    \ to export this model and initiate similar sites elsewhere.\n12 Interviews were\
    \ carried out by Leonelli in January 2016. A subset of the interviews, which inter-\n\
    viewees consented to release in an open access format, is available here: https://zenodo.org/com-\n\
    munities/datastudies/?page=1&size=20\n13 North Wyke researchers are also conducting\
    \ short-term studies in which the data are used as \nevidence for claims about\
    \ phenomena. Examples include research on replacing nitrogen as fertil-\nizer,\
    \ the use of plants to manage soil and water during floods, shifts in soil biota\
    \ as land use \nchanges, and the modelling of grassland production systems. At\
    \ the same time, researchers only \ntake up research that will not “distort” on-going,\
    \ long-term data collection by forcing them to \n“clean” data with too narrow\
    \ a set of epistemic goals in mind.\nFrom Dirty Data to Tidy Facts: Clustering\
    \ Practices in Plant Phenomics and Business…\n94\nronment” (p. 2). In chasing\
    \ dirt when tidying we are “positively re-ordering our \nenvironment, making it\
    \ conform to an idea […] it is a creative moment, an attempt \nto relate form\
    \ to function, to make unity of experience” (p. 3). Douglas emphasizes \nthat\
    \ the identification of dirt should not be considered as a unique, isolated event.\
    \ \n“Where there is dirt there is system. Dirt is the by-product of a systematic\
    \ ordering \nand classification of matter, in so far as ordering involves rejecting\
    \ inappropriate \nelements” (p. 44). Cleaning is the reaction which condemns any\
    \ object or idea likely \nto confuse or contradict cherished classifications,\
    \ thus “reducing dissonance” \n(Douglas 2002, p. 340). Thus cleaning is part of\
    \ the epistemological activity of \nsystematization, such as ordering and classification.\
    \ Douglas distinguishes two \nphases to such systematization practices:\nIn the\
    \ course of any imposing of order, the attitude to rejecting bits and pieces of\
    \ dirt goes \nthrough two stages. First they are recognisably out of place, a\
    \ threat to good order, and so \nare regarded as objectionable and vigorously\
    \ brushed away. At this stage they have some \nidentity: they can be seen to be\
    \ unwanted bits of whatever it was they came from, hair or \nfood or wrappings.\
    \ This is the stage at which they are dangerous; their half-identity still \n\
    clings to them and the clarity of the scene in which they obtrude is impaired\
    \ by their pres-\nence. But a long process of pulverizing, dissolving and rotting\
    \ awaits any physical things \nthat have been recognized as dirt. In the end,\
    \ all identity is gone. The origin of the various \nbits and pieces is lost and\
    \ they have entered into the mass of common rubbish. It is unpleas-\nant to poke\
    \ about in the refuse to try to recover anything, for this revives identity. So\
    \ long \nas identity is absent, rubbish is not dangerous. It does not even create\
    \ ambiguous percep-\ntions since it clearly belongs in a defined place, a rubbish\
    \ heap of one kind or another. \n(Douglas 2002, pp. 197-8)\nThe stage of total\
    \ disintegration is the stage in which dirt has become undifferen-\ntiated. Then\
    \ a cycle has been completed, resulting in an order that is either continu-\n\
    ous with what was there before the cleaning or created by the process of cleaning\
    \ itself.\nDrawing on Douglas’s analysis, we argue that in both of our cases researchers\
    \ \nadopt the same broad strategy for data cleaning: they clean by clustering.\
    \ Cleaning \nis a way to impose order and intelligibility on a dataset, by identifying\
    \ categories \nand typologies for classification, models and algorithms through\
    \ which data can be \nfiltered and selected, and/or tools through which data can\
    \ be displayed and organ-\nised so as to enable further analysis and interpretation.\n\
    The specific mechanisms and tools used to enact this strategy, however, differ\
    \ \nconsiderably across our cases, revealing a divergence in the heuristic principles\
    \ \nused to guide and motivate the cleaning strategies, and the extent to which\
    \ whatever \nis neutralized from a given stage of data cleaning is regarded as\
    \ “unwanted bits” \nwith “some half-identity clinging to them”, or as dirt where\
    \ “identity is absent”.\nIn our economics case, clustering involves looking for\
    \ cyclical patterns through \nvisual judgement. To understand the heuristic behind\
    \ this cleaning procedure, it is \nuseful to discuss briefly Gestalt theory first.\
    \ Gestalt psychologists study perceptual \norganization: “how all the bits and\
    \ pieces of visual information are structured into \nlarger units of perceived\
    \ objects and their interrelations” (Palmer 1999, p. 255). A \n“naïve realist”\
    \ explanation of this organization could be that this organization simply \nreflects\
    \ the structure of the external world. A problem with this explanation is that\
    \ the \nvisual system does not have direct access to how the environment is structured,\
    \ it has \nonly access to the image projected onto the retina, the “array of light\
    \ that falls on the \nM. Boumans and S. Leonelli\n95\nretinal mosaic” (p. 257).\
    \ This optic array allows for an infinite variety of possible \norganizations.\
    \ The question therefore is how the visual system picks out one of them. \nTo\
    \ answer this question Max Wertheimer, one of the founders of Gestalt psychology,\
    \ \nstudied the stimulus factors that affect perceptual grouping: “how various\
    \ elements \nin a complex display are perceived as ‘going together’ in one’s perceptual\
    \ experi-\nence” (Palmer 1999, p. 257). The theoretical approach of the Gestalt\
    \ psychologists is \nthat perceptual organization is grounded in the wish to maximize\
    \ simplicity, or \nequivalently, minimize complexity. They called this hypothesis\
    \ the principle of \nPrägnanz, today also called the minimum principle. It states\
    \ that the percept will be \nas good as the prevailing conditions allow. The term\
    \ “good” refer to the degree of \nfigural simplicity or regularity, and the prevailing\
    \ conditions refer to the structure of \nthe current stimulus image (Palmer 1999,\
    \ p. 289). The Gestalt psychologists saw \nsymmetry as a global property with\
    \ which figural goodness could be analysed.\nThe organising Gestalt in the case\
    \ of the NBER business cycle analysis was a \ncyclical pattern, such as the Fig. 3.\
    \ By taking averages, whether weighted or not \n(which is an act of clustering),\
    \ one aimed at reducing the noise in the observations \nas much as possible. Because\
    \ it is not possible to tidy up by a kind of physical inter-\nvention on some\
    \ physical material, the tidying up is not done by removal but by \nclustering\
    \ in such a way that the cluster itself is “cleaner” than the individual data.\
    \ \nThe principle of Prägnanz that was implicitly applied and was the underlying\
    \ goal \nof the procedures is an as simple as possible shaped cycle with clear\
    \ peaks and \ntroughs.\nIn the economic case, the original data end up as what\
    \ Douglas classified as \nundifferentiated dirt – that is, as objects that are\
    \ forever disconnected from their \noriginal source.\n[T]hese symbols are derived\
    \ by extensive technical operations from symbolic records kept \nfor practical\
    \ ends, or combinations of such records. We are, in truth, transmuting actual\
    \ \nexperience in the workaday world into something new and strange […]. (Burns\
    \ and Mitchell \n1946, p. 17)\nFig. 3 Example of a “typical” business cycle pattern\

    From Dirty Data to Tidy Facts: Clustering Practices in Plant Phenomics and Business…\n\
    96\nIn other words, the process of cleaning by clustering in this case transforms\
    \ a \nlarge quantity of objects that were previously identified as data into objects\
    \ that \nhave new evidential value, but are no longer available or retrievable\
    \ as sources of \ninformation about the contexts from which they were inferred.14\
    \ At the same time, \nit is important to note that the resulting records do not\
    \ completely fail to provide an \nidentity to the discarded objects. Keeping some\
    \ traces of the original time series is \nrelevant if only to verify that results\
    \ are not artificial products of spurious cyclical \npatterns. The visualisations\
    \ of original times and the adjusted one should show suf-\nficient similarity.\
    \ “A common method of judging the goodness of [an] adjustment is \nto see whether\
    \ the adjusted figures show similar movements in successive years” \n(Burns and\
    \ Mitchell 1946, p. 54).\nIn plant phenomics, clustering instead involves defining\
    \ a “landscape” for the \npotential re-contextualisation of data. The starting\
    \ assumption is that phenomics data, \nin all their richness, variability and\
    \ multiplicity of features, may be used for all sorts \nof research goals, ranging\
    \ from studies of irrigation systems to investigations of plant \ngrowth and nutrition\
    \ (as in the case of North Wyke data). Therefore the priority for \nresearchers\
    \ is not the visual intelligibility of a particular way of arranging data, but\
    \ \nrather the creation of categorisations that facilitate the disaggregation\
    \ of data clusters \nwhen needed by the inquiry at hand. In other words, researchers\
    \ want to retain the \nability to trace the origin of the relevant data journeys,\
    \ and evaluate the adequacy of \nevery step of data cleaning towards producing\
    \ reliable evidence for new research \nquestions. Key heuristic principles here\
    \ are: accuracy, in the sense of being as faithful \nas possible to the specific\
    \ characteristics of the research objects at hand; and trace-\nability of data\
    \ sources, in the sense of making sure that prospective data analysts have \n\
    what they need to assess the quality of the data and, if needed, process them\
    \ differ-\nently (which typically includes as extensive an access as possible\
    \ to metadata).\nThis approach is hard to compare to the application of Gestalt\
    \ principles, because \nthose are focusing on visual appearance and presentation,\
    \ while phenomics prac-\ntices of cleaning by clustering focus on interpretability\
    \ and the potential to disag-\ngregate existing data clusters. Nevertheless, like\
    \ the economics case, this is in \nstriking opposition to common sense interpretations\
    \ of the metaphors of “cleaning” \nand “dirt” that focus on the removal of blatantly\
    \ unwanted items. Both in biology \nand economics “dirt” may (and often does)\
    \ contain useful information, which needs \nto be ordered so as to be retrievable\
    \ depending on the interests of the prospective \nanalyst. The original datasets\
    \ and related metadata never fully become undifferenti-\nated dirt as in Douglas’s\
    \ analysis. Rather, researchers attempt to “cling on to their \nhalf-identity”,\
    \ in Douglas’s terms, thus leaving open the option for these objects to \nbe re-identified\
    \ as data and fully reinstated as significant sources of evidence for a \nclaim.\
    \ The main difference between the two fields is that economic data have lost \n\
    more of the identity of their original data than is the case in phenomics. While\
    \ in \nplant phenomics accuracy and traceability are leading, in economics accuracy\
    \ has \nto be balanced with Prägnanz, and traceability is not required.\n14 This\
    \ interpretation assumes a relational account of data epistemology, as outlined\
    \ in Leonelli \n(2016) and in the introduction to this volume.\nM. Boumans and\
    \ S. Leonelli\n97\n4  Comparing Heuristics across Research Communities \nin Natural\
    \ and Social Sciences\nEconomic data are processed in ways that make them much\
    \ more computationally \ntractable than phenomics data due to their numerical\
    \ format. Economic data are thus \nbetter amenable to aggregation and analysis\
    \ in comparison to many other data types, \nwhich potentially expands their scope\
    \ for linkage and aggregation with other datasets \nbut also limits the power\
    \ of investigators to contextualise and situate the data in rela-\ntion to their\
    \ origin. In this case, cleaning by clustering is a cumulative process, in \n\
    which the bulk of “raw” data is replaced by a smaller set of business-cycle “facts”\
    \ \nthrough the exercise of visual principles.15 As a result, analysts working\
    \ at later stages \nof these data journeys are left mostly with data models that\
    \ conform to specific criteria \nand are best used to address a narrow set of\
    \ questions, in conformity with the princi-\nples and assumptions made while preparing\
    \ them for analysis. The original “raw” data \nare no longer accessible, having\
    \ been “cleaned out” in the data visualisations.\nBy contrast, phenomics data\
    \ remain more difficult to analyse through computa-\ntional tools, and can only\
    \ be compared and linked with other datasets by employing \ncase-by-case adjustments.\
    \ They are so heterogeneous, and their ordering into clus-\nters so pluralistic\
    \ and open to multiple interpretations, that additional processing is \nneeded\
    \ every time researchers re-use them for a specific project. When considering\
    \ \ndata on biosource as discussed in section two, for instance, researchers need\
    \ to \ndouble-check what assumptions have been made about the taxonomy of plant\
    \ vari-\neties when ordering plant traits into groups. At the same time, the richness\
    \ of data \nformats and of the information that they carry make them useful evidence\
    \ for a large \nvariety of inquiries, and makes it easier to interrogate their\
    \ reliability and quality in \nrelation to different research conditions and aims.\
    \ Phenomics data can potentially \nbe used to answer many research questions.\
    \ Cleaning by clustering in this case is \nnot a cumulative process: it is crucial\
    \ for researchers to lose as few data and meta-\ndata as possible, as one never\
    \ knows what will turn out to be important later.\nIt has been frequently observed\
    \ that big data aggregation is often accompanied \nby loss of contextual information\
    \ (metadata).16 While in both of our cases the role \nand ordering of contextual\
    \ information plays a key role in the process of cleaning by \nclustering, the\
    \ principles associated to handling such contextual information are \nconsiderably\
    \ different. In economics, metadata become increasingly less relevant: \nthe principles\
    \ guiding data ordering and clustering are those of Prägnanz. In plant \nphenomics,\
    \ metadata never cease to be relevant, as the principles guiding ordering \nand\
    \ clustering are those of accuracy and traceability.\n15 Facts about phenomena,\
    \ in the sense of Bogen and Woodward 1988.\n16 Lawrence Busch (2014, also discussed\
    \ in Mittlestand and Floridi 2016) lists several reasons for \nthis, including:\
    \ Lossiness (lose aspects of the phenomena studied); Drift (phenomena change over\
    \ \ntime, but data representing them do not); Distancing (distance from phenomenon\
    \ facilitates iden-\ntification of patterns); Layering (reducing phenomena to\
    \ set of variables, e.g. in Tidy data); Errors; \nStandards; Disproportionality;\
    \ Amplification/reduction; Narratives.\nFrom Dirty Data to Tidy Facts: Clustering\
    \ Practices in Plant Phenomics and Business…\n98\nAssumptions made about the nature\
    \ of the phenomena at hand (respectively, \nplant morphology and business cycles)\
    \ may seem to have a significant impact on the \ntype of techniques and principles\
    \ enacted by researchers. For instance, the propo-\nnents of MIAPPE explicitly\
    \ note that\nwe are fully aware that MIAPPE suggests a description of the experiment\
    \ that is rather \nextended in comparison to current practices. Hence, although\
    \ we think that all of the attri-\nbutes in Table 1 are needed to adequately describe\
    \ each dataset, we accept that, in practice, \nthe full complement of information\
    \ may not be possible to collect, or might be unavailable \nto the person building\
    \ the dataset. Therefore, we have selected and marked those descriptors \ndeemed\
    \ absolutely essential. (Ćwiek-Kupczyńska et al. 2016, 7)\nRemarkably, their “absolutely\
    \ essential” list of traits still comprises 35 attributes, \na skinnier list than\
    \ the original list of over 80 attributes (ranging from 70 to over a \nhundred\
    \ depending on growth conditions and type of environment/soil), but still \ndaunting\
    \ in its richness.\nWe do not think that these differences should be viewed simply\
    \ as a measure of \nthe difference between studying plants and studying economic\
    \ conditions. Both \ntypes of phenomena are highly complex in their own ways,\
    \ and arguably economic \nbehaviour is even more difficult to reduce to a simple\
    \ set of variables. A more plau-\nsible explanation lies in the methods and commitments\
    \ characterizing the two fields \nof inquiry. Economics, business cycle analysis\
    \ in particular, is a highly generalist \nfield but it is not holistic: research\
    \ focuses on analysing the business cycle as an \nisolated phenomenon. By contrast,\
    \ plant phenomics favours a holistic approach, \nemphasising the complexity of\
    \ the interrelated processes through which plant mor-\nphology is constituted\
    \ (see Fig. 4 and also Leonelli 2016, ch. 6).\nFurthermore, plant phenomics has\
    \ no pretension to achieve a “complete repre-\nsentation” (or complete knowledge)\
    \ of the plant systems it analyses, precisely \nbecause of their daunting complexity\
    \ and the fact that so little is as yet known about \nthem. Thus, any model proposed\
    \ in plant science to analyse a phenomenon will be \nlimited in scope, and need\
    \ to be complemented by several others to provide a more \ncomprehensive picture\
    \ of the phenomena for specific investigative goals. Related to \nthis, mathematical\
    \ and statistical modelling – while of course strongly present in \nthis work –\
    \ are not always the primary or main tool of analysis; and their role is not \n\
    always one of data validation, they are also employed as tools to order and display\
    \ \nthe data at hand in ways that may help analysis (Leonelli 2019).\n5  Conclusions\n\
    Our analysis points to the difficulties experienced by analysts in providing general\
    \ \nprinciples of cleanliness with regard to research data. This is nicely exemplified\
    \ \nwhen considering the ongoing debate around the identification and application\
    \ of \noverarching “tidy data principles” in contemporary data science, which\
    \ seeks to \noutline criteria for “cleaning” and structuring data so as to make\
    \ them amenable to \ncomputational analysis (Wickham 2014). Within this framework,\
    \ data processing is \nM. Boumans and S. Leonelli\n99\nFig. 4 Representation of\
    \ the conceptual landscape for phenomics, taken from a seminal review \npaper\
    \ from Walter et al. (2015)\nconceptualised as consisting of four stages: (1)\
    \ import data; (2) tidy data; (3) trans-\nform/visualise/model data; (4) communicate\
    \ data. Tidy datasets are defined as pro-\nviding “a standardized way to link\
    \ the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with \nits semantics (its meaning)”\
    \ (Wickham 2014, 2), thus helping to prepare data for \nvisualisation and modelling.\
    \ This literature does not shy away from data diversity, \nand recognises that\
    \ data “tidiness” comes in a variety of different flavours depending \non the\
    \ field and goals of inquiry, the statistical and computational tools available\
    \ \n(which are referred to as “tidy tools”, p. 20), and the cognitive preferences\
    \ of inves-\ntigators. The starting point for this work is to acknowledge that\
    \ determining what are \nobservations and what are variables is relatively easy\
    \ in the case of specific datasets, \nbut that such a distinction is hard to define\
    \ in general terms, also because of the \ndiversity often characterising data\
    \ sources and levels of abstraction. At the same \ntime, an attempt is made to\
    \ discuss tools through which “messy data” can be “tidied \nup”, so as to be ready\
    \ for computational analysis. An example is the activity of \n“melting”, which\
    \ consists of stacking datasets by turning columns of numbers into \nrows. Another\
    \ is “string splitting”, which involves splitting the columns of any given \n\
    data table into different variables. Furthermore, a series of “tidy tools” are\
    \ presented, \nsuch as data aggregation, filtering, visualisation and statistical\
    \ modelling, whose \ncommon aim is to “take untidy datasets as input and return\
    \ tidy datasets as outputs” \n(p. 12). All these strategies for cleanliness are\
    \ meant to “make analysis easier by \neasing the transitions between manipulation,\
    \ visualisation and modelling” (p. 15).\nThis approach to data cleaning aligns\
    \ nicely with the strategy that we have called \n“cleaning by clustering”. At\
    \ the same time, our reading of Douglas’s work on dirt \nprovides a conceptual\
    \ framework and rationale for this approach. It makes it clear \nthat cleanliness\
    \ is not a matter of removing unnecessary items, “noise” or “mess” \nFrom Dirty\
    \ Data to Tidy Facts: Clustering Practices in Plant Phenomics and Business…\n\
    100\nfrom somehow predefined “meaningful datasets”, thus assuming that (1) there\
    \ is a \n“best way” to order data regardless of the research aims of specific\
    \ investigations; \nand (2) what researchers should consider as reliable and veritable\
    \ data need to be \nuncovered and separated from “meaningless noise”. By contrast,\
    \ we propose to view \ndata cleanliness as a process of ordering data into clusters,\
    \ which runs in parallel with \nsituated attempts to assign meaning to data in\
    \ relation to specific research questions \nand goals. Thus cleaning can take\
    \ a variety of different forms – and result in very \ndifferent ideas of “what\
    \ counts as data” – depending on the assumptions, commit-\nments and circumstances\
    \ of the research projects at hand. Moreover, our cases have \nshown that the\
    \ above mentioned four stages of data analysis are actually four aspects \nof\
    \ one process of data interpretation which cannot be separated from each other.\n\

    \ irrigation overcomes the water shortage\nproblem, and automatic sensor measurements\
    \ reduce the observational work of farmers. This paper\nfocuses on a method for\
    \ developing context-aware systems using ontologies. Ontologies are used\nto solve\
    \ heterogeneity issues in sensor measurements. Their main goal is to propose a\
    \ shared data\nschema that precisely describes measurements to ease their interpretations.\
    \ These descriptions are\nreusable by any machine and understandable by humans.\
    \ The context-aware system also contains\na decision support system based on a\

    \ Ontology addresses the development of the context-aware system\nin general.\
    \ The Irrigation ontology automates a manual irrigation method named IRRINOV®.\n\
    These ontologies reuse well-known ontologies such as the Semantic Sensor Network\
    \ (SSN) and Smart\nAppliance REFerence (SAREF). The decision support system uses\
    \ a set of rules with ontologies to\ninfer daily irrigation decisions for farmers.\
    \ This project uses real experimental data to evaluate the\nimplementation of\
    \ the decision support system.\nKeywords: agriculture; smart irrigation; context-aware\
    \ system; ontology; rules\n1. Introduction\nIn the agricultural domain, farmers\
    \ need to observe natural phenomena to engage in appropriate\nactivities on their\
    \ ﬁelds. For example, in traditional irrigation, farmers go to their ﬁelds to\
    \ examine\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803; doi:10.3390/app10051803\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n2 of 41\nthe crop development stage and measure the\
    \ soil moisture provided by probes in the soil. Then, they\nuse practical experience\
    \ or follow an irrigation method to estimate manually the water needs of their\n\
    crops. Based on their estimations, the farmers decide whether to irrigate the\
    \ ﬁelds. This conventional\napproach has two signiﬁcant drawbacks. First, irrigation\
    \ requires daily observations, often made by\nfarmers. Manual observations are\
    \ inﬂuenced by other factors such as the weather or the situation of\nfarmers.\
    \ For example, a daily observation could be skipped if the farmer is sick. Second,\
    \ the resource\nshortage problem demands that farmers use water sparingly.\nContext-aware\
    \ systems (CASs) can overcome the above-mentioned situations. A CAS uses a\nwireless\
    \ sensor network (WSN) to monitor environmental phenomena and uses those measurements\n\
    for further processes. In a CAS, context refers to “any information that can characterize\
    \ the situation of\nan entity. An entity could be a person, a place or an object\
    \ that is considered relevant to the interaction\nbetween a user and an application,\
    \ including the user and the application themselves” [1]. A CAS\nhas two contexts:\
    \ a low-level context and a high-level context [2]. The low-level context contains\n\
    quantitative data. The high-level context contains qualitative data that synthesize\
    \ a situation and ease\nthe decision. For example, the statement “soil moisture\
    \ is 160 centibar (cbar)” presents a low-level\ncontext; however, the statement\
    \ “soil is dry” presents a high-level context.\nThe CAS has some peculiar characteristics.\
    \ First, sensors in the system are heterogeneous. Each\ntype of phenomenon demands\
    \ a different type of sensor. For example, in agriculture, pluviometers\nmeasure\
    \ rain quantity, and tensiometers measure soil moisture. Thus, the CAS should\
    \ address\nsome data interoperability issues. Second, the system should have the\
    \ capability to process the raw\nmeasurement data and apply reason on them.\n\
    To address the above requirements, ontologies are adequate candidates. Some sensor\
    \ ontologies\nare provided by several institutes of standardization. Their main\
    \ goal is to propose a shared data\nschema that precisely describes measurements\
    \ to ease their interpretations. These descriptions are\nreusable by any machine\
    \ and understandable by humans. They propose a data modeling design pattern\n\
    that is precise enough to answer any informational need. Thus, any sensor measurements\
    \ described\nby these ontologies may be reusable by several decision support systems\
    \ (DSSs). The sensor network\nbecomes a data provider for several applications.\
    \ For example, rain quantity measurements can be\nused by irrigation decision\
    \ systems and crop disease management systems. Reusing existing ontologies\nenables\
    \ the harmonization of sensor measurement descriptions. Moreover, those descriptions\
    \ share\nthe same data model. Thus, they are easy to integrate in a global data\
    \ schema. Furthermore, some\nontologies enable reasoning over data because they\
    \ propose logical descriptions. In short, ontologies\nused in context modeling\
    \ can solve the heterogeneity issues of various sensor measurements and infer\n\
    the high-level context and decisions by applying rules. To the best of our knowledge,\
    \ the proposed\nwork is the ﬁrst to reuse two well-known ontologies: the new version\
    \ of the Semantic Sensor Network\n(SSN) [3] and Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF)\
    \ [4].\nThis paper presents the development method of a CAS that combines two\
    \ engineering\nmethodologies: ontology and information systems. This method was\
    \ used to build a smart irrigation\nCAS that automates a manual irrigation method.\
    \ This irrigation method, called IRRINOV®, was\ndeveloped by Arvalis (Arvalis\
    \ is an applied agricultural research organization dedicated to arable\ncrops.\
    \ It engages in many activities at 27 different local sites in France.) and its\
    \ partners. The IRRINOV®\nmethod is widely used in many regions in France. The\
    \ development of the system also includes the\ndevelopment of two new ontologies—the\
    \ Context-Aware System Ontology (CASO) and Irrigation\nontology (IRRIG)—and a\
    \ set of rules for reasoning. The two new ontologies reuse well-known\nontologies\
    \ related to sensors and devices—SSN and SAREF. CASO specializes and extends SSN\
    \ to\ndescribe the processing of context. CASO implements a generic context model\
    \ that can be specialized\nto any observation of environmental phenomena. Using\
    \ CASO simpliﬁes the data processing and rule\ngenerating by dividing them in\
    \ several steps. IRRIG specializes CASO by implementing the IRRINOV®\nmethod.\
    \ The two ontologies model the sensor measurements and results of all measurement\
    \ processing\n(cleaning, aggregation, reasoning, etc.). The system uses a set\
    \ of rules for reasoning. Each rule\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n3 of 41\nimplements\
    \ small inference steps. Thus, they are easy to understand, manage and correct.\
    \ Finally, we\npropose a complete DSS that supports farmers in making daily irrigation\
    \ decisions.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents\
    \ the state of the art of several smart\nirrigation systems available in the research\
    \ world. Section 3 introduces background information for\nthe cycle of processes\
    \ implemented in a CAS and the IRRINOV® method. The next section describes\nthe\
    \ development process of the complete system and the two ontologies. Section 5\
    \ provides an\nexample of the development presented in Section 4. Section 6 presents\
    \ and compares the results after\nimplementing the system using real experimental\
    \ data provided by Arvalis. Also, this section discusses\nthe limitations of the\
    \ IRRINOV® method, the limitations of the Arvalis dataset and the limitations\
    \ of\nthe DSS system. Finally, a brief conclusion sums up the system and presents\
    \ the perspectives.\n2. State of the Art\nAs mentioned in the introduction, an\
    \ ontology is a shared data schema that provides a common\nunderstanding of data\
    \ descriptions. Data descriptions based on ontologies are reusable by any machine\n\
    and understandable by humans. Thus, we examined ontologies already used in irrigation\
    \ decision\nsystems to reuse them as data modeling patterns to improve the results\
    \ of our data modeling activity.\nSeveral expert systems already exist that can\
    \ determine whether a crop needs water. For example,\none expert system uses the\
    \ common-KADS method to irrigate mango trees, as presented in [5]. Please\nnote\
    \ that this expert system is not connected to any sensors or actuators. Its goal\
    \ is to help farmers\ndecide when to irrigate. However, no information about the\
    \ ontology publication is provided.\nSemantic web technologies are already used\
    \ in CASs dedicated to irrigation. For example, the\nFIWARE platform that links\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud has been used in several\ndifferent\
    \ irrigation experiments [6]. The FIWARE cloud platform contains the SEPA SPARQL-based\n\
    engine, which represents information in an RDF format and provides SPARQL queries.\
    \ To the best of\nour knowledge, no information about the ontologies used in these\
    \ experiments is available online.\nThe works of [7,8] present some ontologies\
    \ dedicated to hilly citrus tree cultivation. One ontology\naddresses the irrigation\
    \ decision. The ontology stores the computations of relative soil moisture based\n\
    on the soil type and the crop growth stage. When the soil moisture reaches a given\
    \ threshold, the\nfarmers receive an alert from the system. In this case, the\
    \ ontology is not published; therefore, it is\nimpossible to reuse it.\nTo our\
    \ point of view, the most successful CAS dedicated to irrigation is the one developed\
    \ during\nthe PLANTS project [9]. This system is installed in a greenhouse. It\
    \ uses several types of sensors to\nobserve raspberry plants. This system can\
    \ control watering equipment to control irrigation in the four\nzones of the greenhouse.\
    \ The PLANTS ontology aims to describe e-entities and their interactions [9,10].\n\
    An e-entity is a virtual representation of a physical object that can be either\
    \ a raspberry plant or\nequipment. Every measurement is deﬁned as the parameter\
    \ of an e-entity. Sensor streams are not\naggregated. The last measurements are\
    \ used to update a parameter. The rules are used to derive the\nstates of raspberry\
    \ plants from various parameters. Watering equipment is controlled by the detection\n\
    of “drought stress” in a speciﬁc zone. Thus, the only part of the ontology that\
    \ we want to reuse is the\nplant state hierarchy. Unfortunately, this ontology\
    \ is unavailable on the Web because it is the schema\nof the facts-base implemented\
    \ in the Jess inference engine.\nTo conclude, while several works focus on processing\
    \ sensor streams and computing aggregations,\ntheir results are not directly reusable,\
    \ as our approach should handle the temporal and spatial\naggregation of sensor\
    \ streams for the irrigation use case. Additionally, the ontologies mentioned\n\
    in previous works are either unavailable online or their domain is loosely related\
    \ to our use case.\n3. Background Information\nThis smart irrigation system is\
    \ based on a CAS and the IRRINOV® method. First, the cycle of\nprocesses implemented\
    \ in a CAS provides an overview of the global system: its devices, its phases\
    \ of\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n4 of 41\nprocesses and the transformation from\
    \ data to context. Second, the IRRINOV® method speciﬁes the\nrequirements of the\
    \ system and the basic algorithm for making decisions.\n3.1. Cycle of Processing\
    \ Dedicated to CAS\nIn irrigation, a CAS has three speciﬁc components. First,\
    \ a WSN plays the role of sensing and\nmonitoring the plot environment. Second,\
    \ a DSS can (1) send notiﬁcations to farmers to support them\nin their decision-making\
    \ process and (2) automatically make decisions and control the watering system.\n\
    Third, watering devices are in charge of watering the soil in the ﬁeld.\nThe CAS\
    \ processes can be grouped and represented as a cycle of processes [11]. This\
    \ cycle is\ncalled the CAS life cycle. It is divided into four phases: (1) acquisition,\
    \ (2) modeling, (3) analysis, and\n(4) exploitation. Please note that this section\
    \ improves our previous work about CAS life cycle [12] by\ndecreasing the number\
    \ of phases. The exchange between two phases can consist of data, the low-level\n\
    context or the high-level context. The CAS life cycle for smart irrigation is\
    \ depicted in Figure 1. The four\nphases of its life cycle are described as follows.\n\
    Exploitation\nphase\nAcquisition\nphase\nModeling\nphase\nAnalysis\nphase\nData\n\

    \ 1. Life cycle of a smart irrigation CAS.\n•\nAcquisition phase focuses on how\
    \ the system retrieves and processes measurements from sensor\ndevices and data\
    \ from external data sources. The output of this phase are measurements and\n\
    related data derived after raw data cleaning processes.\n•\nModeling phase focuses\
    \ on the data model and the integration of input data into the system.\nThe system\
    \ is equipped with a storage service. The input data are organized with a common\n\
    data model to become the low-level context. As shown in Figure 1, the input of\
    \ this phase is data\nderived from the acquisition phase. The output of this phase\
    \ is the low-level context. This paper\nconsiders ontologies as a candidate for\
    \ the data modeling process.\n•\nAnalysis phase focuses on the transformation\
    \ from the low-level context into the high-level\ncontext. The high-level context\
    \ is an enrichment of the context with qualitative data. Such\ndata summarize\
    \ the situation of entities and support the decision process. The system uses\
    \ a\nrules-based inference engine for the reasoning process. As shown in Figure\
    \ 1, the input of this\nphase is the low-level context. The output of this phase\
    \ is the high-level context. This paper\nconsiders Drools (https://www.drools.org/)\
    \ as a candidate for the inference engine.\n•\nExploitation phase focuses on the\
    \ use of the high-level context to distribute them to\ncorresponding agents, which\
    \ can be other devices or users. The input of this phase is the\nhigh-level context.\
    \ The output of this phase can be human-readable content, a message to an\nexternal\
    \ system or a reaction of a watering device to the environment.\nAppl. Sci. 2020,\

    \ (All versions of the IRRINOV® method are available\nat http://www.irrinov.arvalisinstitutduvegetal.fr/irrinov.asp)\
    \ method. This method, developed by\nArvalis and its partners, proposes a guide\
    \ to make irrigation decisions based on measurements of soil\nmoisture sensors\
    \ and pluviometers oriented to farmers. The method aims at answering the following\n\
    questions: (1) When should irrigation be started, or when should watering devices\
    \ be installed on the\nplot? (2) When should we start each watering cycle (“Watering\
    \ cycle” is the action of an irrigation\nsystem performing a watering activity\
    \ on all the plots engaged in the system. “Watering cycle duration”\nis the number\
    \ of days between two consecutive waterings of the same plot)? (3) When should\
    \ irrigation\nbe stopped, or when should farmers withdraw the watering devices?\n\
    A set of decision tables and recommendations are provided by IRRINOV® method to\
    \ allow\nfarmers to manage their irrigation system on a single plot. Numerous\
    \ variants of the method are\nproposed depending on the soil, plot and crop types.\
    \ This work uses the IRRINOV® method for the\nregion Midi-Pyrénée, which is dedicated\
    \ to maize crop plants on clay-limestone soil [13] and includes\nthe following\
    \ measuring equipment:\n•\nOne IRRINOV® measuring station composed of six Watermark\
    \ (https://www.irrometer.com/\nsensors.html#wm) probes that measure the soil water\

    \ The goal of this section is to\nillustrate the processing deﬁned un previous\
    \ section. The IRRINOV® method speciﬁes the time needed\nto install the devices\
    \ on the plot. The IRRINOV® station and the mobile pluviometer should be placed\n\
    in the plot when the crop reaches growth stage V2 (V2, V7, R1, and R5 are the\
    \ code names of maize\ngrowth stages deﬁned in [14]. They are respectively named\
    \ “7 leaf”, “10 leaf”, “silking” and “dent\nstage with 50% moisture” in the Arvalis\
    \ growth stage classiﬁcation.). The measurements can start two\nor three days\
    \ after installation. The Watermark probes are typically read once a week, but\
    \ during dry\nweather, farmers can check the probes more frequently, for example,\
    \ one observation per day. Irrigation\nshould stop when the crop reaches the growth\
    \ stage R5hg45. Please note that state R5 is deﬁned in [14];\nhowever, the state\
    \ R5hg45 is deﬁned in this project. This state means that the crops have moisture\
    \ dents\nequivalent to 45%. The IRRINOV® method speciﬁes the constraints to validate\
    \ the measurements\nof Watermark probes. Those treatments are part of the acquisition\
    \ phase. If the difference between\nthe probe measurements is above 30 cbar, then\
    \ one of the probes is malfunctioning, and the farmer\nshould visit the ﬁeld to\
    \ correct the probe installation. The value read on a Watermark probe must\nbe\
    \ multiplied by the correction coefﬁcient, which is speciﬁc for each batch of\
    \ probes. For example,\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n6 of 41\nprobes from 2013 have\
    \ a correction coefﬁcient equal to 1.0. In this paper, we call the former value\
    \ a\nraw data value. The latter value after this process is the measurement value.\
    \ Please note that when\nthe measurement value is 199 cbar, the IRRINOV® method\
    \ considers that there is a contact problem\nbetween the Watermark probe and the\
    \ soil. The measurement value represents the soil tension and has\nthe cbar unit.\
    \ It is part of the output of the acquisition phase.\nThe IRRINOV® method relies\
    \ on decision tables to determine when to start a watering cycle\ndepending on\
    \ the soil moisture measurements and crop growth stage. An example of table that\n\
    determines when to start a watering cycle for clay-limestone soil is provided\
    \ in Table 1 which is, in fact,\napplied to maize crops when their growth stage\
    \ is between V2 and V7. The decision table indicates that\nthe farmer should start\
    \ the ﬁrst watering cycle when the median value of three probe measurements\n\
    reach a given threshold.\nTable 1. Decision table of the relation of the watering\
    \ cycle duration and the soil moisture for maize at\ngrowth stage V2.\nWatering\

    \ table should be read as “If the plot has a watering cycle\nduration ﬁxed between\
    \ 9 and 10 days”, and one of the two following conditions is satisﬁed:\n(1)\n\
    “When the median value of three probe measurements at 30 cm depth are above the\
    \ 30 cbar\nvalue” and “when the median value of three probe measurements at 60\
    \ cm depth are above the\n10 cbar value”.\n(2)\n“When the total (sum of the median\
    \ of 30 cm depth measurements and the median of 60 cm depth\nmeasurements) is\
    \ above 40 cbar”.\nThen, a watering cycle should start.\nThis project translates\
    \ all the decision tables into rules to transform the manual IRRINOV® method\n\
    into an automatic DSS. Those processing are part of the analysis phase. The exploitation\
    \ phase will\ntranslate the irrigation decision into a command executable by the\
    \ watering device.\n4. CAS Development\nThe development methodology used to develop\
    \ the smart irrigation CAS is the mini-waterfall\nmethodology [15]. Additionally,\
    \ CASO and IRRIG ontologies have been developed following the\nlinked open terms\
    \ (LOT) methodology [16].\nA mini-waterfall is a methodology used for system engineering.\
    \ It is inspired by the well-known\nwaterfall methodology, which develops a system\
    \ in ﬁve activities: (1) speciﬁcation, (2) design, (3)\nimplementation, (4) testing\
    \ and (5) maintenance. The purpose of the mini-waterfall methodology is to\nrepeat\
    \ the sequence of the ﬁve activities multiple times to develop the system progressively.\n\
    LOT is a methodology used for ontology engineering. It was ﬁrst proposed in [16]\
    \ and further\ndeveloped at [17]. LOT is inspired by agile techniques in which\
    \ sprints aim to align ontology\ndevelopment with software development agile practices.\
    \ This methodology focuses on (1) the reuse\nof terms (classes, properties and\
    \ attributes) existing in already published vocabularies or ontologies\nand (2)\
    \ the publication of the ontology following the linked data principles. LOT relies\
    \ on the\nontological engineering activities deﬁned in the NeOn methodology [18]\
    \ when available. LOT deﬁnes\niterations over the following four activities: (1)\
    \ ontological requirements speciﬁcation, (2) ontology\nimplementation, (3) ontology\
    \ publication, and (4) ontology maintenance.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n7 of\
    \ 41\nFigure 3 illustrates the smart irrigation CAS development methodology combined\
    \ with the\nontology development methodology. Ontology development has a life\
    \ cycle called the LOT life\ncycle. The LOT life cycle is presented by the dashed\
    \ yellow box. Each activity in this life cycle is\nrepresented by a solid yellow\
    \ box. The solid black arrows between the boxes show the order of the\nactivities;\
    \ for example, the development team must perform the ontological requirements\
    \ speciﬁcation\nactivity before the ontological implementation activity. The CAS\
    \ development life cycle is called a\nmini-waterfall life cycle. It is presented\
    \ by the dashed blue box. Each activity in this life cycle is\nrepresented by\
    \ a solid blue box. The solid yellow arrow between one activity X in the LOT life\
    \ cycle\nand one activity Y in a mini-waterfall life cycle means that the result\
    \ of activity X is necessary to\nimplement activity Y. For example, the design\
    \ activity of the mini-waterfall cycle requires the result of\nthe ontology conceptualization\
    \ activity of the LOT life cycle. Otherwise, the dashed blue arrow from\none activity\
    \ Y of mini-waterfall to one activity X of LOT life cycle means that the result\
    \ of the activity\nY can contribute to activity X. It is necessary to note two\
    \ items in this methodology. First, the LOT life\ncycle is triggered by the mini-waterfall\
    \ life cycle, but it is independent of the mini-waterfall life cycle.\nConsequently,\
    \ the LOT life cycle can be shorter than the mini-waterfall life cycle. Suppose\
    \ that after\neach development life cycle, there is a new version. Therefore,\
    \ there is nothing to prevent the ontology\nfrom having three versions at the\
    \ same time, but the system can only have one version. Second, after\nthe maintenance\
    \ activities of both the LOT life cycle and CAS life cycle, the development team\
    \ renews\nthe sequence, i.e., starts with the ﬁrst activity. However, they can\
    \ skip the current activity if they ﬁnd\nthat the last time result of the same\
    \ activity is sufﬁcient.\nSpecification\nDesign\nImplementation\nTesting\nOntological\n\

    \ methodology to develop a system.\nThe speciﬁcation activity analyzes and identiﬁes\
    \ all the requirements for the system and the\nassociated ontology (global data\
    \ schema). In the design activity, the system uses a network of ontologies\nto\
    \ model the results of all data processing. Therefore, ontology implementation\
    \ is part of the system\ndesign. In the CAS implementation activity, the system\
    \ imports the ontologies. The result after a CAS\nimplementation activity contributes\
    \ to the ontology evaluation activity. If the CAS is implemented,\nthen the ontologies\
    \ cover all the requirements. The ontologies should be available in public URIs\n\
    through ontology publication. Ontology evaluation and system testing are necessary\
    \ to guarantee that\nthe system works correctly. Finally, the system and the ontologies\
    \ are maintained.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n8 of 41\nDuring the speciﬁcation\
    \ activity, we identify several sensor streams to be processed. The next\nactivities\
    \ of the mini-waterfall methodology (design, implementation and testing) were\
    \ applied on one\nstream at a time to cover all the requirements. Then, a global\
    \ algorithm was implemented that merges\nall the results of the stream processing.\n\
    4.1. CAS Speciﬁcation\nFirst, it is necessary to present the resources for system\
    \ development. All the requirements of the\nsystem are extracted from the following\
    \ resources:\n•\nThe IRRINOV® method version for the region Midi-Pyrénée, France.\n\
    •\nThe Arvalis dataset: real experimental data from Arvalis and INRAE (INRAE (French\
    \ National\nResearch Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment) was founded\
    \ on 01/01/2020 from the\nfusion between INRA and IRSTEA. It supports the profound\
    \ changes in agriculture, food and the\nenvironment in France, Europe and around\
    \ the world through its research activities.). This is an\nexcel ﬁle that contains\
    \ recorded daily observations and activities of farmers in a maize plot T1 B1\
    \ -\nDKC4814 from 14/06/2013 to 06/10/2013 in Gaillac, France. Please note that\
    \ the observations\nrecorded in the Arvalis dataset are the daily aggregated values\
    \ of the sensor measurements. In\nother words, the data in the dataset are already\
    \ processed from the raw measurements.\n•\nFarming journal (“Carnet de Terrain”\
    \ in French): a document that contains several tables to record\nall the precise\
    \ observations related to the plot. It is a kind of experimentation journal that\
    \ was\nused frequently in research laboratories.\n•\nExperiences and knowledge\
    \ from specialists in the agriculture domain. The specialists are from\nArvalis\
    \ and INRAE.\nThis subsection focuses on two requirements: the data modeling requirement\
    \ and the processing\nrequirement. The data modeling requirement is needed for\
    \ developing ontologies. The processing\nrequirement is used to identify the type\
    \ of processing applied on the sensor streams (cleaning,\naggregation, comparison).\n\
    4.1.1. Ontology Requirement\nFirst, the IRRINOV® documentation [13] was studied\
    \ to identify the following:\n•\nThe type of sensors used and their measurements.\n\
    •\nThe data needed to make the decision: type of soil, type of crop, sowing date,\
    \ sensor localization\nand depth, quantity of rain per day, evolution of crop\
    \ growth stage, and moisture measurements\nat different depths.\n•\nThe different\
    \ processes applied to the sensor measurement streams, such as data cleaning,\
    \ spatial\nand temporal aggregation, and threshold comparison.\n•\nThe different\
    \ decisions produced by the method.\nSecond, it was necessary to communicate with\
    \ specialists of Arvalis and INRAE to clarify the\nIRRINOV® method. Some of the\
    \ questions formulated to the experts were as follows: What is the\ndifference\
    \ between an irrigation period and a watering cycle? What are the possible values\
    \ of maize\ngrowth stages? How are we to observe a growth stage?\nThird, to generalize\
    \ the system, it was necessary to derive standard deﬁnitions and concepts in\n\
    the agriculture domain. This work was carried out by querying a web retrieval\
    \ system. The selected\nresources were articles referenced in publications and\
    \ from well-known organizations. For example,\nthe different maize growth stages\
    \ are deﬁned in a publication from the University of Iowa [14].\nFourth, the analysis\
    \ of the Arvalis dataset provided a better understanding of the computing\nprocesses\
    \ on sensor measurements, as well as the experimental details such as the type\
    \ of soil and the\ncode names of the sensors.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n9 of\
    \ 41\nThe ﬁrst analysis enabled this system to deﬁne several process workﬂows\
    \ corresponding to the\ntype of sensor measurement stream. A workﬂow deﬁnes the\
    \ aggregations (or any mathematical\nfunctions) and deductions applied on the\
    \ streams. An example of temporal aggregation is the\ncomputation of the average\
    \ on a 24-h window applied on a soil moisture stream produced by one\nprobe. Then,\
    \ the aggregation results are conceptualized into a property of an observed phenomenon.\n\
    This system considers four main sensor streams described by observed phenomena\
    \ and associated\nproperties: (1) the moisture of the soil, (2) the quantity of\
    \ rain, (3) the growth stage of the crop, and (4)\nthe water need state of the\
    \ crop.\nMoreover, from the ﬁrst analysis, an ontology requirement speciﬁcation\
    \ about the smart\nirrigation CAS was generated. These speciﬁc requirements were\
    \ written as a competency questions\ndocument. An online spreadsheet (The spreadsheet\
    \ is available on the GitLab repository of this project\nhttps://gitlab.irstea.fr/irrig/public/tree/master/CompetencyQuestions)\
    \ was deﬁned to share them.\nIt contains the following ﬁelds:\n•\nThe identiﬁed\
    \ code of requirements.\n•\nThe competency questions written in natural language.\
    \ Various forms of the question were\nwritten to generalize them.\n•\nSome examples\
    \ of answers to identify the domain value.\n•\nThe explanation of the answer.\n\
    •\nThe references of the vocabulary deﬁnitions.\nFigure 4 presents an excerpt\
    \ of the current competency questions.\nPlease note that these\ncompetency questions\
    \ are a large table with many columns and rows; we only show an excerpt\nas an\
    \ illustration. For example, CQ1.1 expresses the need to know the type and brand\
    \ of each sensor.\nCQ1.3 expresses the need to deﬁne the type of sensor streams\
    \ used as inputs in the IRRINOV® method.\nFigure 4. Screenshot of a part of the\
    \ competency questions document containing the questions and\nanswers from CQ1.1\
    \ to CQ1.4.\n4.1.2. Processing Requirement\nIn studying the IRRINOV® method, we\
    \ noticed that the irrigation decisions proposed by this\nmethod are based on\
    \ several aggregation measurements: temporal aggregation and spatial aggregation.\n\
    We notice that the decision workﬂows of processes follow the same pattern: provide\
    \ a stream of sensor\nmeasurements, aggregate certain sensor measurements extracted\
    \ from the stream, and then compare\nthe aggregation results to a threshold. The\
    \ thresholds enable us to deﬁne certain states. A state is\nqualitative data of\
    \ a property that characterizes the observed phenomenon. The goal of the rules\
    \ is\nto determine the state of each property. The design activity goal will be\
    \ to translate each statement\nin decision tables and the associated threshold\
    \ into one or several reasoning rules. The speciﬁcation\nrequirements activity\
    \ identiﬁes each process belonging to one workﬂow dedicated to one stream and\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n10 of 41\ndetermines its input, its output and its\
    \ parameters (thresholds). For example, the workﬂow dedicated\nto the soil moisture\
    \ stream starts with a measurement process from a soil tensiometer probe. Then,\n\
    those measurements are the input data of a sequence of aggregation processes.\
    \ The last aggregation\nvalue is compared to a threshold to produce a state of\
    \ a soil moisture entity. This example is precisely\noutlined in Section 5.\n\
    Second, the Arvalis dataset provided the parameters to precisely determine the\
    \ aggregation\nprocesses used in the IRRINOV® method. Examples of such information\
    \ are the watering cycle\nduration and the threshold for soil moisture.\n4.2.\
    \ CAS Design\nThis subsection focuses on explaining the conceptualization process\
    \ of the ontologies. Later,\nthe system design describing how to use the ontologies\
    \ for data modeling is presented.\n4.2.1. Ontology Conceptualization\nFirst, the\
    \ ontology requirements speciﬁcation was oriented to the development of one ontology\n\
    to support the smart irrigation CAS. However, it should be noted that a general\
    \ part of the ontology\ncould be reusable for other use cases; therefore, we decided\
    \ to materialize the implementation in\ntwo ontologies, CASO and IRRIG. In the\
    \ following, a typical approach for the conceptualization is\ndetailed, and then\
    \ the decisions about the ontology modularization used to create CASO and IRRIG\
    \ are\ndescribed. Please note that our ontologies have already studied well-known\
    \ ontologies about sensor\nmeasurements [12]. They choose to reuse SSN since this\
    \ ontology provides a precise description of\nmeasurements based on data modeling\
    \ patterns. SSN deﬁnes several patterns that help to understand\nthe data modeling\
    \ issues.\nThe ﬁrst step towards a conceptualization was to identify from the\
    \ competency questions\ndocument those ontology elements that needed to be represented.\
    \ More precisely, this step was\ncarried out in the following order:\n•\nIdentiﬁcation\
    \ of concepts: We want to model all the processes applied to sensor streams. They\n\
    are mainly aggregations and threshold comparisons. The goal of the comparison\
    \ is to derive\nqualitative (symbolic) data. To differentiate quantitative from\
    \ symbolic computation, we need\nto use deduction. A deduction provides qualitative\
    \ data as a result. These results are the entity\nstates that should be deﬁned\
    \ in some referential item. For example, maize growth stages are\nstates deﬁned\
    \ in a certain thesaurus. In most cases, the state of an entity is derived because\
    \ one\nvalue is above or below a threshold. We model thresholds as state boundaries.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of relations: To characterize a deduction, we need two new relations:\
    \ (1) a relation\nthat links a deduction to its resulting state and (2) a relation\
    \ that links a deduction to the period\nwhen this deduction is valid, i.e., the\
    \ period when the entity is associated with a state.\n•\nIdentiﬁcation of cardinality\
    \ restrictions applied for relations: This step also involves a decision on\n\
    whether the relation at hand should be deﬁned as functional. For example, the\
    \ relation between\na deduction and its result is functional. A deduction has\
    \ only one result: the state of the entity\nderived by the deduction.\n•\nIdentiﬁcation\
    \ of individuals: Following the SSN pattern, these entities are characteristics\
    \ of the\nfeature of interest [3]. They are modeled as an instance of the class\
    \ ssn:Property, which are linked\nto an instance of the class sosa:FeatureOfInterest\
    \ by the object property ssn:hasProperty. To\nspecialize an SSN to the irrigation\
    \ use case, the involved properties in the use case, for example,\nair temperature\
    \ or crop stage, have been deﬁned as instances of properties.\nNext, ontologies\
    \ and particular ontology elements were identiﬁed to be reused. The following\n\
    selected ontologies have been developed and maintained by standardization organizations.\n\
    •\nThe W3C & OGC Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology describes sensors, observations,\n\
    samples and actuators [3].\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n11 of 41\n•\nSmart Appliances\
    \ REFerence (SAREF) (http://www.w3id.org/saref) is an ontology for smart\nappliances\
    \ that contributes to semantic interoperability in the IoT domain [4].\nThis ETSI\n\
    recommendation focuses on the representation of appliances and devices together\
    \ with their\nfunctions, commands, services, states and proﬁles (It is necessary\
    \ to mention that CASO and\nIRRIG reuse some concepts from SAREF and SAREF4AGRI,\
    \ which are unavailable in the latest\npublished versions of these ontologies,\
    \ but it is known by the authors that they will be available\nin the next versions.\
    \ SAREF4AGRI is an extension of SAREF for agriculture.).\n•\nThe W3C PROV ontology\
    \ represents provenance information [19].\n•\nThe W3C SKOS vocabulary describes\
    \ knowledge organization systems. It will be useful in\ndeﬁning properties and\
    \ their states [20].\n•\nThe W3C OWL-Time (http://www.w3.org/2006/time), an ontology\
    \ of temporal entities,\ndescribes the temporal properties of resources.\nAnother\
    \ well-known ontology reused in this conceptualization is the Ontology of Units\
    \ of Measure\nand Related Concepts (OM) [21].\nIn some cases, the reused ontology\
    \ elements matched the intended use in the developed ontology;\ntherefore, they\
    \ were adopted without modiﬁcation. Some examples of this case are the classes\n\
    sosa:Platform, sosa:FeatureOfInterest or om:Unit.\nHowever, in other cases, some\
    \ additional properties or constraints had to be added to the\nreused elements.\
    \ Then, a new subclass of reused concepts was created to attach the new semantics\n\
    to the subclasses created.\nFor example, the class caso:Observation is a specialization\
    \ of the\nclass sosa:Observation since sosa:Observation represents any computation\
    \ activity in general.\ncaso:Observation uses the object property prov:wasInformedBy\
    \ to identify the inputs of the\ncomputation. The class caso:Deduction is a specialization\
    \ of caso:Observation. A deduction is\nalso a computation or a measurement that\
    \ has a state for a result.\ncaso:hasClosedUpperBoundary\ncaso:hasOpenUpperBoundary\n\

    \ 1803\n12 of 41\nFinally, the conceptualization was modularized into two ontologies:\
    \ CASO and IRRIG. The IRRIG\nontology imports and extends CASO. The CASO ontology\
    \ is illustrated in Figure 5. This IRRIG\nontology is depicted in Figure 6. The\
    \ entities deﬁned in the CASO and IRRIG ontologies are preceded\nby the preﬁxes\
    \ “caso” (yellow boxes) and “irrig” (blue boxes), respectively.\nThe goal of CASO\
    \ is to model any context processing. IRRIG is a specialization of CASO used to\n\
    describe all the context processing involved in the IRRINOV® method. For this\
    \ reason, it specializes\nsome elements of CASO, as shown in Figure 6. For example,\
    \ IRRIG specializes the class ssn:Property\nin different subclasses related to\
    \ moisture, stress, and growth. Several subclasses of caso:Observation\nspecify\

    \ of the IRRIG ontology.\nDuring the conceptualization phase, several versions\
    \ of the ontology model are produced and\nstored in a private repository of INRAE.\
    \ Figures 5 and 6 are parts of the lastest version (v201912).\n4.2.2. System Design\n\
    Two main steps used to model the smart irrigation CAS are (1) to identify the\
    \ entities needed to\nmodel and (2) to choose the appropriate vocabulary and relation\
    \ from CASO and IRRIG to model the\ndetermined entities.\nFirst, we determined\
    \ the entities needed to model the smart irrigation CAS. The following\nvocabulary\
    \ should be considered entities:\n•\nFeature of interest is the natural phenomenon\
    \ observed by sensors.\n•\nThe property of the feature of interest can be a quantitative\
    \ property (a sensor measurement or\naggregation) or a qualitative property (a\
    \ state that is a result of threshold comparison).\n•\nData processing actions\
    \ and the actor that executes the action. The data processing may be a\nmeasurement,\
    \ an aggregation or an inference.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n13 of 41\n•\nResult\
    \ and the time related to the action.\nThe action could be a measurement, aggregation\
    \ or deduction (threshold comparison or inference).\nOn the one hand, the result\
    \ of a deduction should be qualitative data that are a state of the entity. On\n\
    the other hand, the result of the measurement and aggregation is numerical data.\n\
    Table 2 shows a list of entities needed to model. This table contains six columns:\n\
    •\nWorkﬂow: there are four streams deﬁned in this project: (1) crop growth, (2)\
    \ crop water need, (3)\nsoil moisture, and (4) rain quantity. Each stream speciﬁes\
    \ a dedicated workﬂow of processes.\n•\nFeature of interest: the phenomenon that\
    \ needs to be observed: crop, rain, soil, etc.\n•\nProperty: the aspect of the\
    \ phenomenon that needs to be observed.\n•\nType of action: could be a measurement,\
    \ an aggregation or a deduction.\n•\nActor: depending on the type of action, an\
    \ actor could be a sensor, a software component that\nimplements an aggregation,\
    \ or an inference engine for the deduction.\n•\nType of result: could be a state\
    \ or a numeric value.\nTable 2. List of features of interest, properties and actors\
    \ that require modeling.\nWorkﬂow\nFeature of\nInterest\nProperty\nType of\nAction\n\

    \ table, in addition to the entities related to the agricultural phenomenon, it\
    \ is essential to\nmention the two other entities: sleeping and delay. Sleeping\
    \ is the period after a watering action of one\nplot. No more watering action\
    \ is applied on this plot during the sleeping period. Delay is the period\nwhen\
    \ a watering action is postponed due to a rain event.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n\
    14 of 41\nThe second step of the CAS modeling is to select the vocabulary in CASO\
    \ and IRRIG to model\nthe entities. In CASO and IRRIG, the features of interest,\
    \ properties and state of properties were\npredeﬁned. Thus, the remaining work\
    \ creates the individuals for the appropriate actions, numeric\nresults, actors\
    \ and time that relate to the corresponding feature of interests and properties.\n\
    The list of modeled entities and their associated processes deﬁned from the above\
    \ analysis enabled\nus to design part of the CAS. To design inference processes\
    \ (the rules), we build a state diagram for\neach workﬂow. This diagram presents\
    \ the conditions for a property reaching a state. Moreover, this\nindicates the\
    \ behavior of the system after the property reaches the state. The state diagram\
    \ uses a set\nof information:\n•\nList of the states for the concerned property.\n\
    •\nThe conditions under which that property can reach a state.\n•\nThe actions\
    \ of the system after the property reaches the state.\nTo design the state change\
    \ of certain properties, we selected the UML state diagram. First, we\ndrafted\
    \ the state changes in chronological order. Based on this ﬁrst draft, we designed\
    \ the conditions\nof state changes based on the IRRINOV® decision table. Then,\
    \ we checked each set of conditions to\nmake them independent. The goal was to\
    \ have the same set of conditions always reach the same state\nvalue. In the end,\
    \ the state diagram took into account synchronization issues between the new sensor\n\
    measurements, the aggregation processes and the state changes. For that reason,\
    \ an Init state was\ncreated in each state diagram to represent a synchronization\
    \ point for daily computation. Moreover,\neach state diagram has a clock to manage\
    \ the synchronization between all the processes.\nSection 5.1.4 presents the lastest\
    \ version of the state diagram related to the RootZoneMoistureLevel\nproperty.\
    \ The conditions of the state diagram will be translated into semantic web rule\
    \ language\n(SWRL) rules during the implementation activity.\n4.3. CAS Implementation\n\
    This subsection presents the process used to transform the model of the ontologies\
    \ and the system\ninto software products using encoding languages.\n4.3.1. Ontology\
    \ Encoding\nOnce the models were designed, the two ontologies were encoded in\
    \ OWL [22] using Protégé [23].\nThe implementation of the ontologies included\
    \ the declaration of metadata such as authors, dates,\nand licenses, according\
    \ to [24]. The OWL code of the ontologies is available on two distinct GitHub\n\
    repositories. The current implementation of CASO contains 27 classes, 40 object\
    \ properties and 4\ndatatype properties reusing the SOSA, SSN, SKOS, SAREF, PROV,\
    \ Time, and OM ontologies. The\nIRRIG ontology imports CASO and extends it with\
    \ 31 classes, 4 properties and 71 individuals to model\nthe irrigation use case\
    \ states, properties and features of interest. Among them, four classes and three\n\
    datatype properties are reused from SAREF4AGRI.\n4.3.2. System implementation\n\
    This project developed a program called Ontogen. This program was written in Python\
    \ and Java.\nIn the Arvalis use case, Ontogen takes as input speciﬁc sensor measurements\
    \ provided by Arvalis in\nan Excel ﬁle and produces the output as the state of\
    \ CropWaterNeed property. The program itself can\nbe divided into three modules:\n\
    •\nVirtual sensors: read data from Excel ﬁles.\n•\nAggregators: run functions\
    \ to produce aggregated data.\n•\nInference engine: The core is OWLAPI (https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi)\
    \ and SWRLAPI\n(https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi). This module uses a\
    \ set of SWRL rules, and all the\ndata provided from the previous module to infer\
    \ the high-level context.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n15 of 41\nThe aggregations\
    \ are encoded in Python as a function. The deductions are executed by the\nSWRLAPI\
    \ Drool inference engine integrated into Ontogen. In detail, the reasoning process\
    \ of the\ninference engine in Ontogen can be explained as follows. First, Ontogen\
    \ generates an OWL ﬁle\nthat contains all the individuals and the IRRIG ontology\
    \ necessary for the rule engine; it creates\nall the individuals that describe\
    \ sensor measurements. It also creates the individuals, instances of\ncaso:Deduction,\
    \ necessary to deﬁne the daily deduction per instance of the class caso:Property.\
    \ The\nﬁle name is the concatenation of the feature of interest name and the beginning\
    \ date. Second, it\nlaunches the Drools rule engine and applies it to the individuals\
    \ previously created. The Drools engine\nupdates the caso:Deduction instance.\
    \ It links an instance of the class caso:State with an instance of\ncaso:Deduction\
    \ via the object property caso:hasResultState. Then, it creates a new OWL ﬁle\
    \ that\ncontains the results of the inference engine. The OWL ﬁle is updated from\
    \ the previous ﬁle. The\nrule for Drools is coded in SWRL. There are a total of\
    \ 25 rules in SWRL and two queries in semantic\nquery-enhanced web rule language\
    \ (SQWRL):\n•\n5 rules for crop growth.\n•\n1 rule for rain intensity.\n•\n1 rule\
    \ for root zone soil moisture level.\n•\n16 rules for crop water need.\n•\n2 SQWRL\
    \ queries for the results after the reasoning.\nEach rule is put in a rule ﬁle\
    \ with a “.rule” extension. The rule ﬁles are available on the GitLab\nrepository\
    \ of INRAE via the following link https://gitlab.irstea.fr/irrig/public/tree/master/Rule.\n\
    The DSS consists of (1) a knowledge base and an inference engine, mostly for high-level\n\
    context inference, and (2) several functions for numeric data calculation.\nExcept\
    \ for the case\nof SleepingDuration, it is a numeric value, but the inference\
    \ engine produces its value.\nThe\nknowledge-base contains a rules-base and a\
    \ facts-base. Technically speaking, the DSS is a part\nof the Ontogen program.\
    \ Each day, the DSS takes phenomenon observations as input and produces an\nirrigation\
    \ decision. Please note that the Arvalis dataset does not provide the sensor measurements\
    \ but\nthe daily aggregated values of those measurements.\nFigure 7 shows the\
    \ algorithm implemented by the DSS. At 06:00:00 on day d, the system triggers\n\
    the DSS to start the computation. First, the DSS retrieves the observations relevant\
    \ to days d-1 and\nd recorded in the Arvalis dataset. Please note that in the\
    \ algorithm of Figure 7, the data retrieved at\nthe instant [d 06:00:00] belong\
    \ to the period [d-1 00:00:00, d 06:00:00]. The DSS checks the\nvalue of the evaluation\
    \ of the CropGrowth property of day d-1. As the IRRINOV® method is valid\nonly\
    \ when the state of CropGrowth is from V7 to R5hg45, then the DSS has three possible\
    \ cases: (1)\nif the state of CropGrowth is less than V7, then the DSS waits until\
    \ the next day to reevaluate the\nCropGrowth, (2) if the state of CropGrowth equals\
    \ R5hg45, then the DSS stops, and (3) if the state of\nCropGrowth is between V7\
    \ and R5hg45, then the DSS continues to retrieve rules to create a fact related\n\
    to CropGrowth. The fact integrates rules as axioms. After determining the fact,\
    \ the DSS can launch the\nDrools inference engine to infer the state of CropGrowth\
    \ for day d-1. Next, the DSS runs the functions\nto obtain the value of the root\
    \ zone average moisture of day d-1 and to obtain the number of delay days.\nThe\
    \ function to obtain the value of root zone average moisture takes the value of\
    \ the average moisture\nof day d-1 corresponding to each soil tensiometer from\
    \ the Arvalis dataset. Additionally, the function\nto obtain the number delay\
    \ days takes the value of the total rain quantity of day d-1 from the Arvalis\n\
    dataset. The DSS collects all calculated results and retrieves the other rules\
    \ related to RainIntensity,\nRootZoneMoistureLevel and CropWaterNeed properties\
    \ and updates them. Later, the Drools inference\nengine infers the state of the\
    \ three mentioned properties and the value of SleepingDuration. Based on\nthe\
    \ state of CropWaterNeed, the DSS offers two solutions: (1) if the state of CropWaterNeed\
    \ is Yes,\nthe DSS suggests that users launch irrigation on day d; otherwise,\
    \ (2) if the state of CropWaterNeed\nis No, NotApplicable or Unavailable, the\
    \ DSS suggests that users do nothing. After producing the\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10,\
    \ 1803\n16 of 41\nsuggestion, the system saves the results of all computations\
    \ into the knowledge base. Finally, the DSS\ncontinues to wait until 06:00:00\
    \ of the next day (d+1).\nevaluate CropWaterNeed\n[d-1 00:00:00, d 00:00:00[\n\

    CASO and IRRIG are examined using an ontological testing tool. The project also\
    \ develops a\ngroup of unit tests and sample test scenarios to verify the working\
    \ mechanism of the system.\n4.4.1. Ontology Evaluation\nThe presented ontologies\
    \ have been evaluated following three approaches: checking the absence\nof bad\
    \ practices, coverage and data-oriented validation.\nTo check the absence of bad\
    \ practices or common errors in the ontology, the online pitfall scanner\nOOPS!\
    \ [25] has been applied to IRRIG and CASO. After executing the system, the following\
    \ changes\nwere made: (1) deﬁne some properties as the inverse of corresponding\
    \ properties, (2) add metadata as\nrdfs:label and rdfs:comment for ontology elements,\
    \ and (3) properly enter some ontology elements\nas OWL classes or properties.\n\
    Regarding the competency questions coverage, the IRRIG ontology, which as already\
    \ mentioned\ncontains CASO, has been compared to the CQ previously deﬁned. For\
    \ each CQ, the ontology elements\nneed to answer the questions that have been\
    \ identiﬁed.\nFinally, we checked whether the data from our use case could be\
    \ annotated with the ontologies.\nTo do this, an RDF ﬁle representing one day\
    \ of measurements from the Arvalis dataset in 2013 was\ngenerated. Some examples\
    \ from this ﬁle are outlined in detail in Section 5.\n4.4.2. System Testing\n\
    The project develops multiple unit tests and sample tests to evaluate the rules\
    \ and aggregations.\nThe sample test scenarios contain speciﬁc data from the Arvalis\
    \ dataset.\n•\n20 test scenarios for crop growth workﬂow.\n•\n14 test scenarios\
    \ for rain intensity workﬂow.\n•\n21 test scenarios for soil moisture workﬂow.\n\
    •\n83 test scenarios for crop water need workﬂow.\n4.5. CAS Maintenance\nCASO\
    \ and IRRIG are maintained based on a GitHub repository, and the smart irrigation\
    \ project is\nmaintained using a GitLab repository.\n4.5.1. Ontology Publication\
    \ and Maintenance\nThe key factor in maintaining the two ontologies is the interactions\
    \ between our maintainer\nteam and the community. Then, the CASO and IRRIG ontologies\
    \ must be published online. The\npublication of the CASO and IRRIG ontologies\
    \ relies on the https://w3id.org/ permanent identiﬁers\ninitiative. The ontology\
    \ publication follows the content negotiation mechanism. The URIs https:\n//w3id.org/def/caso#\
    \ and https://w3id.org/def/irrig# identify the two ontologies. The content\nnegotiation\
    \ mechanism deployed to publish the ontologies was transparent to ontology developers,\
    \ as\nit was managed by OnToology [26]. OnToology is a web-based system that builds\
    \ on top of Git-based\nenvironments and integrates a set of tools for documentation,\
    \ evaluation and publication activities.\nThe HTML published was generated by\
    \ OnToology’s integrated version of Widoco [27] and manually\nupdated to include\
    \ information about the ontology using a general description and diagrams.\nThe\
    \ issue tracker provided by GitHub is the tool used to receive feedback and control\
    \ issue lists.\nIn addition to this portal, CASO and IRRIG developers also provide\
    \ maintainer email addresses that\nenable another method for the community to\
    \ contact.\nIn our road map, IRRIG is maintained for ﬁve years. CASO will be maintained\
    \ even longer.\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n18 of 41\n4.5.2. System Maintenance\n\
    A smart irrigation CAS is still in development by our team. We have implemented\
    \ and tested\nall the processes located on the server. Now, we need to improve\
    \ the development of the sensor and\nactuator network. To maintain the system\
    \ and continue with development, we use a private GitLab\nrepository. This repository\
    \ is open to identiﬁed users. Thus, those users can indicate issues to the\ndevelopment\
    \ team using the issue tracker.\n5. Example of CAS Development\nThe development\
    \ of CAS produces complex design works of many entities related to rain intensity,\n\
    crop growth, root zone moisture level and crop water needs. Figure 8 shows the\
    \ four workﬂows\nin this project. In a limited scope, this paper presents a part\
    \ of the design activity that shows the\ntransformation from soil moisture measurement\
    \ to the state of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property.\nWe select this transformation\
    \ because it contains a temporal aggregation and a spatial aggregation.\nMoreover,\
    \ the data used as the illustration in this part is the date 14/08/2013 in the\
    \ Arvalis data.\nA tensiometer measures the soil tension [28]. The soil tension\
    \ affects the water extraction capability\nof crops:\n•\nWhen the soil tension\
    \ is low, the crops require less energy to extract soil water. In other words,\n\
    when a tensiometer returns a high value, the soil moisture level is low.\n•\n\
    When the soil tension is high, the crops must use a large amount of energy to\
    \ extract soil water.\nThe IRRINOV® method evaluates the water needs of crops\
    \ by estimating the root zone moisture.\nRoot zone moisture is the quantity of\
    \ “water remaining in the depth of soil accessed by a plant” [29].\nIt depends\
    \ on the soil type, root depth and irrigation method. Its goal is to evaluate\
    \ the amount of\nirrigation water required by the plants [30]. The system uses\
    \ six tensiometers to evaluate the root\nzone moisture.\nSoil30cmDeph\nMoistureObservation\n\

    \ 8. Four workﬂows of the CAS.\nRootZoneMoistureLevel is an observational property\
    \ of the root zone feature of interest.\nThe RootZoneMoistureLevel property is\
    \ qualitative data represented by a state. These states are\ndetermined based\
    \ on tensiometer measurements. Each tensiometer is placed at a speciﬁc depth in\
    \ the\nsoil. Thus, the RootZoneMoistureLevel property depends on the following\
    \ quantitative data properties:\n•\nSoil30cmDepthMoisture: the moisture of a new\
    \ feature of interest that represents the soil layer at\na 30 cm depth (Soil30cmDepth).\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n19 of 41\n•\nSoil60cmDepthMoisture: the moisture of\
    \ a new feature of interest that represents the soil layer at\na 60 cm depth (Soil60cmDepth).\n\
    •\nSoil30cmDepthDailyAverageMoisture: the daily average moisture of the feature\
    \ of interest\nSoil30cmDepth. It equals the daily average of the property Soil30cmDepthMoisture.\n\
    •\nSoil60cmDepthDailyAverageMoisture: the daily average moisture of the feature\
    \ of interest\nSoil60cmDepth. It equals the daily average of the property Soil60cmDepthMoisture.\n\
    •\nRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture:\nthe daily average moisture of the root zone\
    \ feature of\ninterest.\nIt represents a spatial aggregation of Soil30cmDepthDailyAverageMoisture\
    \ and\nSoil60cmDepthDailyAverageMoisture properties.\nThe section aims to present\
    \ some activities of the mini-waterfall methodology. Please note that\nthe speciﬁcation\
    \ activity is already described in Section 4.1. This activity has produced a set\
    \ of\nrequirements. The design activity is divided into two parts: process conceptualization\
    \ and ontology\nconceptualization. The ontology conceptualization activity uses\
    \ ontologies to model the input and\noutput of each process previously deﬁned.\
    \ The implementation activity presents the rule associated\nwith the soil moisture\
    \ stream. Finally, the testing activity shows some typical test cases.\n5.1. Processes\
    \ Conceptualization\nThis subsection presents in detail the processes related\
    \ to the soil moisture stream. A sequence of\nprocesses builds a speciﬁc workﬂow,\
    \ as shown in Figure 8.\n5.1.1. Aggregation Processes of Soil Measurement\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst aggregation process is the computation of the daily aggregated soil moisture\
    \ of the\nsoil tensiometer. In the Arvalis dataset, each observation was stored\
    \ as two datapoints: (1) the\ndaily aggregated soil moisture in cbar and (2) the\
    \ date of observation (year, month, day). Three soil\ntensiometers observe the\
    \ moisture at a 30 cm depth, and three others observe the moisture at a 60 cm\n\
    depth. The soil tensiometers used in the IRRINOV® method are Watermark probes.\
    \ Watermark probe\np measures the soil moisture at time t of day d. The unit of\
    \ the Watermark probe is the cbar. Please note\nthat a measurement value of 199\
    \ cbar indicates an error in the measurement process. Thus, the cleaning\nprocess\
    \ is applied to remove all 199 cbar values. The function getValidMoistureProbe(p,t)\
    \ returns only\nthe valid moisture value measured by probe p at time t. If the\
    \ moisture value is not valid, the function\nreturns nothing. The function getDailyAggregatedMoisture(p,d)\
    \ returns the average value of all the\nvalid moisture values measured by probe\
    \ p during the interval [d 00:00:00, d+1 00:00:00[. Table\n3 presents the calculation\
    \ of getDailyAggregatedMoisture(p,d) for one probe. Please note that the data\n\
    recorded in the Arvalis data are, in fact, the value of the function getDailyAggregatedMoisture(p,d).\n\

    \ of rules are the daily states of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property. For each\
    \ day, a\nstate should be determined. The list of possible states is as follows:\n\
    •\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.Init:\nThis\nstate\nrepresents\nthe\nfact\nthat\nthe\n\
    function\ngetRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d) will be evaluated from new measurements\
    \ of tensiometers.\nThe tensiometers will perform several measurements per day.\
    \ This state is not an output of the\nautomata. It is a transitional state before\
    \ determining the new state of the RootZoneMoistureLevel\nproperty\n•\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.Saturated:\
    \ The root zone is saturated by water. Crops do not need extra\nwater. Moreover,\
    \ any machine is allowed to access the plot.\n•\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.VeryHigh:\
    \ The root zone contains a signiﬁcantly high amount of water.\nCrops do not need\
    \ water regardless of its growth stage.\n•\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.High: The root\
    \ zone contains a high amount of water. Crops need water\nat speciﬁc growth stages.\n\
    •\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.Average: The root zone contains an average amount of\
    \ water. Crops\nneed water at speciﬁc growth stages.\n•\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.Low:\
    \ The root zone contains a low amount of water. Crops need water\nat speciﬁc growth\
    \ stages.\n•\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.VeryLow: The root zone contains an insigniﬁcant\
    \ amount of water.\nCrops need water at speciﬁc growth stages.\n•\nRootZoneMoistureLevel.Dry:\
    \ The root zone is dry. Crops need water regardless of its growth\nstage.\nThe\
    \ states of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property follow the order VeryLow < Low\
    \ < Average\n< High < VeryHigh < Saturated. Those states follow the inverse order\
    \ of the value of the function\ngetRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d).\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2020, 10, 1803\n21 of 41\n5.1.3. Threshold\nCertain thresholds are used to determine\
    \ the state of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property from\nthe result of the function\
    \ getRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d). Please note that these thresholds\ndepend\
    \ on the variety of maize crops and soil types.\n•\nTh_ST_Minimum: The smallest\
    \ value measured by a Watermark probe. In the Watermark’s\nspeciﬁcation, it is\
    \ ﬁxed at 0 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_Saturation: This threshold value in the Arvalis experimentation\
    \ is 10 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_VeryHigh: This threshold value in the Arvalis experimentation\
    \ is 70 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_High: This threshold value in the Arvalis experimentation\
    \ is 120 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_Average: This threshold value in the Arvalis experimentation\
    \ is 140 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_Low: This threshold value in the Arvalis experimentation\
    \ is 150 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_VeryLow: This threshold value in the Arvalis experimentation\
    \ is 160 cbar.\n•\nTh_ST_Maximum: This is set to 301 cbar, which is higher than\
    \ any measurement value provided\nby any Watermark probe. The maximal measurement\
    \ value that a Watermark probe can reach\nranges from 0 to 200. However, to compute\
    \ the soil tension, the manufacturer provides a\ncoefﬁcient. The measurement value\
    \ is multiplied by the coefﬁcient to obtain the soil tension value.\nThe maximum\
    \ coefﬁcient provided by Watermark’s manufacturer is 1.5 (from 2002 until now),\n\
    and the maximal soil tension value is 300 cbar (200 cbar * 1.5).\nThe relations\
    \ between thresholds and states of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property are\npresented\
    \ in Figure 9. The blue squares represent the state of the RootZoneMoistureLevel\
    \ property.\nThe green squares represent the soil tension thresholds.\nThe dashed\
    \ line squares represent a\nRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d) value. Each of the\
    \ squares’ positions show the upper threshold\nand the lower threshold. For example,\
    \ if the RootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d) value is superior or\nequal to Th_ST_Low\
    \ (150) and inferior to the Th_ST_VeryLow (160), then the RootZoneMoistureLevel\n\

    The transition from the initial state towards the state Init indicates when the\
    \ state\nof the CropGrowth property is V7 or any upper state;\nthen, the RootZoneMoistureLevel\n\
    property reaches the state Init.\nAfter reaching this state, a new evaluation\
    \ of the function\ngetRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d) is performed based on daily\
    \ tensiometer measurements.\nThe transition from the state Init towards the state\

    \ the RootZoneMoistureLevel property reaches the Saturated state. After\nreaching\
    \ this state, the clock tsoil is reset.\nThe transition from the state Init towards\

    \ the VeryHigh state. After\nreaching this state, the clock tsoil is reset.\n\
    The transition from the state Init towards the state High indicates that when\
    \ the value of the\nfunction getRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d) is equal or superior\
    \ to Th_ST_VeryHigh and inferior\nto Th_ST_High, then the RootZoneMoistureLevel\
    \ property reaches the High state. After reaching this\nstate, the clock tsoil\
    \ is reset.\nThe transition from the state Init towards the Average state indicates\
    \ that when the value of the\nfunction getRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d) is equal\
    \ or superior to Th_ST_High and inferior to\nTh_ST_Average, then the RootZoneMoistureLevel\
    \ property reaches the Average state. After reaching\nthis state, the clock tsoil\

    \ property reaches the Low state. After reaching this\nstate, the clock tsoil\

    \ property reaches the Dry state. After reaching\nthis state, the clock tsoil\
    \ is reset.\nThe transition from one state among Saturated, VeryHigh, High, Average,\
    \ Low, VeryLow and\nDry towards the state Init indicates that after one day ((tsoil\
    \ >= 1)?), a state change is possible; in other\nwords, a state is reached for\
    \ a whole day.\nThe transition from the state Init towards the ﬁnal state indicates\
    \ that when the CropGrowth\nproperty is at the state R5hg45, then moisture measurements\
    \ are terminated.\n5.2. Ontology Conceptualization\nThe ontology IRRIG is used\
    \ to model the input and output of our DSS. During the decision\nprocess, we need\
    \ to model the following:\n•\nThe measurements of six tensiometers.\n•\nThe average\
    \ of the measurements provided by a tensiometer for a whole day.\n•\nThe computation\
    \ of the root zone moisture per day.\n•\nThe output of the deduction process,\
    \ as the states of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property deduced\nby the rule engine.\n\
    This section uses a data sample on 14/08/2013 from the Arvalis dataset to illustrate\
    \ the\nconceptualization. The sample (https://gitlab.irstea.fr/irrig/public/tree/master/Sample/)\
    \ was\nmodeled in Turtle format.\n5.2.1. Tensiometer Measurement Model\nThe goal\
    \ of this subsection is to model the tensiometer measurements or, more precisely,\
    \ the result\nof the function getValidMoistureProbe(p,t). A tensiometer may be\
    \ placed at a 30 cm or 60 cm depth.\nThis section describes the valid measurement\
    \ of a tensiometer placed at a 30 cm depth. This model\nreuses some elements of\
    \ the IRRIG ontology. IRRIG deﬁned several classes and instances used for\nmodeling\
    \ tensiometer measurements:\n•\nirrig:featureOfInterest_Soil30cmDepth:\nthis\n\
    individual\nrepresents\nthe\nsoil\nlayer\nat\na\n30 cm depth.\nThis individual\
    \ is an instance of the class sosa:FeatureOfInterest.\nThe\nindividual\nirrig:featureOfInterest_soil30cmDepth\n\
    is\nlinked\nto\nthe\nindividual\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n24 of 41\nirrig:observableProperty_soil30cmDepth_moisture\
    \ by the sosa:hasProperty object property\n(see Figure 11).\n•\nirrig:MoistureProperty:\
    \ this class is a subclass of ssn:Property. It represents the amount of water\n\
    available inside the entity. The moisture aspect of the entity is intrinsic to\
    \ and cannot exist without\nthe entity. The moisture quality value should be expressed\
    \ by a qualitative value such as a state\nor by a quantitative value (see Figure\
    \ 11).\n•\nirrig:observationProperty_soil30cmDepth_moisture: this individual represents\
    \ the moisture\nproperty of the soil layer at a 30 cm depth. It is an instance\
    \ of the class irrig:MoistureProperty\n(see Figure 11).\n•\nirrig:Soil30cmDepthMoistureObservation:\n\
    this class is a subclass of caso:Observation.\nIt is a deﬁned class that represents\
    \ the act of carrying out a procedure (observation)\nto estimate or calculate\
    \ a value of a moisture property related to the soil layer\nat\na\n30\ncm\ndepth.\n\
    This\nmoisture\nproperty\nis\nrepresented\nby\nthe\nindividual\nirrig:observableProperty_soil30cmDepth_moisture.\
    \ Two necessary and sufﬁcient conditions are\ndeﬁned: (1) All instances of the\
    \ class irrig:Soil30cmDepthMoistureObservation are linked to the\nindividual irrig:observableProperty_soil30cmDepth_moisture\
    \ via the sosa:observedProperty\nobject property; (2) All instances of irrig:Soil30cmDepthMoistureObservation\
    \ are linked to the\nindividual irrig:featureOfInterest_soil30cmDepth via the\
    \ sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest object\nproperty. Each instance of irrig:Soil30cmDepthMoistureObservation\
    \ is linked to a sensor to\ndescribe which tensiometer made the observation and\
    \ how.\nFirst, the measurement data are stored in the system under the IRRIG model.\

    The observation individual is linked to the sensor that made the observation.\
    \ We assumed\nthat the node, which contains a tensiometer probe, also has the\
    \ capacity to clean the probe\nmeasurements. A node tensiometer is represented\
    \ by an instance of the class sosa:Sensor. It is\nalso an instance of the class\
    \ saref4agri:SoilTensiometer. Arvalis identiﬁes their tensiometers by\na number\
    \ and depth, as presented in Section 4.1.\nWe reuse this information to create\
    \ a name\nfor each instance of saref4agri:SoilTensiometer. For example, Figure\
    \ 11 contains the individual\narvalis:soilTensiometer_1_30cm.\nA tensiometer measurement\
    \ is an instantaneous observation. Please note that the measurements\nof tensiometers\
    \ are unavailable in the Arvalis dataset.\nThus, we can imagine that tensiometer\n\
    measurements may happen at any time of the day. Figure 11 presents a measurement\
    \ that happens\nat 08:00:00 on 14/08/2013. To store the time of the measurement,\
    \ we create an instance of the class\ntime:Instant. The time:inXSDDateTimeStamp\
    \ data property stores the associated date time value. The\nsosa:phenomenonTime\
    \ object property links the observation individual to the instant individual.\n\
    To present the time when the node tensiometer generates the measurement, we use\
    \ the\nsosa:resultTime datatype property to links the observation individual to\
    \ the xsd:dateTime value\ncorresponding to a precise time. In Figure 11, this\
    \ precise time is at 08:00:00 on 14/08/2013.\nThe result of tensiometer measurement\
    \ is presented by an instance of the class sosa:Result. This\nresult is described\
    \ by a value and a unit. The instance of sosa:Result is linked to the data value\
    \ via\nthe om:hasNumericValue datatype property. The instance of sosa:Result is\
    \ linked to the individual\nom:millibar, an instance of the class om:Unit, via\
    \ the om:hasUnit object property. Please note that\nin the Arvalis dataset, the\
    \ unit of tensiometer measurement is the cbar. However, to the best of our\nknowledge,\
    \ this unit has not yet been deﬁned in any ontology. Thus, we prefer to reuse\
    \ the millibar\n(mbar), a unit that is already deﬁned in well-known ontologies\
    \ such as OM. For this reason, this model\nuses the millibar as the unit for moisture,\
    \ as shown in Figure 11.\n5.2.2. Function getDailyAggregatedMoisture Model\nThe\
    \ goal of this subsection is to model the result of the function getDailyAggregatedMoisture(p,d).\n\
    This function computes the daily average of all the measurements provided by one\
    \ tensiometer. IRRIG\ndeﬁnes several classes and instances used for modeling the\
    \ daily average of tensiometer measurements:\n•\nirrig:observationProperty_soil30cmDepth_dailyAverageMoisture:\
    \ this individual represents the\ndaily average of the moisture property related\
    \ to the soil layer at a 30 cm depth.\nIt is\nan instance of the class irrig:MoistureProperty.\
    \ This individual is linked to the individual\nirrig:featureOfInterest_soil30cmDepth\
    \ (see Figure 12).\n•\nirrig:Soil30cmDepthDailyAverageMoistureObservation:\nthis\n\
    class\nis\na\nsubclass\nof\ncaso:Observation. It is a deﬁned class that represents\
    \ the act of carrying out a procedure\n(observation) to calculate the average\
    \ per day of the moisture property. This speciﬁc property is\nrepresented by the\

    \ of getDailyAggregatedMoisture(p,d).\nThe instance of the class irrig:Soil30cmDepthDailyAverageMoistureObservation\
    \ represents\nthe computation of the daily average of all measurements provided\
    \ by one tensiometer, as shown\nin Figure 12. By deﬁnition, individuals of irrig:Soil30cmDepthMoistureObservation\
    \ are linked to\nthe individual irrig:observedProperty_soil30cmDepth_dailyAverageMoisture,\
    \ an instance of the class\nirrig:MoistureProperty, and to the individual irrig:featureOfInterest_soil30cmDepth.\n\
    The observation individual is linked to the sensor that produces the result, i.e.,\
    \ a software program\nthat computes the daily average of several measurements.\
    \ We do not have information on the agent\nthat produces this computation in the\
    \ Arvalis dataset. It is possible that the same software, located\non a server,\
    \ computes the average for all the measurements. Alternatively, the IRRINOV station\
    \ may\ncontain two different processing devices. Each device can compute the average\
    \ for all the tensiometers\nlocated at the same depth. To avoid errors, we create\
    \ a software agent for each tensiometer based\non the tensiometer name: arvalis:aggregator_getDailyAggregatedMoisture_1.\
    \ The individual that\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n27 of 41\nrepresents the software\
    \ is an instance of the class sosa:Sensor. The observation individual is linked\
    \ to\nthe software agent via the sosa:madeBySensor object property, as shown in\
    \ Figure 12.\nThe software program produces the result once per day at a precise\
    \ time. In the Arvalis dataset,\nthere is no information about the hour, minute\
    \ and second of the computation. For synchronization\npurposes, we ﬁx it to the\
    \ time of the deduction computation [d+1 06:00:00]. At this time, all the\ntensiometer\
    \ measurements were available for the computation of the average. To store the\
    \ time of the\ncomputation, we use the sosa:resultTime datatype property to links\
    \ the observation individual to the\nxsd:dateTime corresponding to the precise\
    \ time [d+1 06:00:00]. This is presented in Figure 12.\nThe computation calculates\
    \ the daily average. Figure 12 presents the average for the 14/08/2013.\nWe represent\
    \ the day as a period of 24 h: [d 00:00:00, d+1 00:00:00[.\nThus, we create an\n\
    instance of the class time:Interval, which is described by two instances of time:Instant.\n\
    The\nsosa:phenomenonTime object property links the observation individual to the\
    \ time:Interval instance.\nA computation of daily average is based on several\
    \ tensiometer measurements. Thus, the instance\nof the class irrig:Soil30cmDepthDailyAverageMoistureObservation\
    \ is linked to several instances of\nthe class irrig:Soil30cmDepthMoistureObservation\
    \ via the prov:wasInformedBy object property, as\nshown in Figure 12.\nThe result\
    \ of the computation is represented by an instance of the class sosa:Result. This\
    \ instance\nis described by a unit and a value, as shown in Figure 12.\n5.2.3.\

    is\nto\nmodel\nthe\nresult\nof\nthe\nfunction\ngetRootZoneDailyAverageMoisture(d).\n\
    The value represents the evaluation of average daily\nmoisture related to the\
    \ root zone. First, the computation is relative to the daily average moisture\n\
    property, as presented in the previous section. Second, the feature of interest\
    \ is no more a soil layer at\na speciﬁc depth, but a volume of soil named root\
    \ zone, as explained in the introduction paragraph.\nIRRIG deﬁnes several classes\
    \ and instances used for modeling the measurements of the daily average\nmoisture\
    \ of root zone:\n•\nirrig:featureOfInterest_rootZone: this individual represents\
    \ the root zone. This individual is an\ninstance of the class sosa:FeatureOfInterest.\
    \ The individual irrig:featureOfInterest_rootZone\nis linked to the individual\
    \ irrig:observableProperty_rootZone_dailyAverageMoisture by the\nsosa:hasProperty\

    \ this individual represents the daily\naverage of the moisture property related\

    \ a subclass of caso:Observation.\nIt is a deﬁned class that represents the act\
    \ of carrying out a procedure (observation) to calculate the\ndaily average of\

    \ of root zone moisture level property.\nEach day, our system makes decisions\
    \ about the value of certain properties, such as crop growth,\nrain intensity\
    \ and root zone moisture level. These decisions are based on several sensor observations\n\
    performed during day d. Day d is represented by an interval of 24 h: [d 00:00:00,\
    \ d+1 00:00:00[.\nFor the synchronization of computations, the frequency of such\
    \ decisions should be ﬁxed to one precise\ntime. According to Météo-France, the\
    \ record of rain quantity per day is made between day d at 06:00:00\nto day d+1\
    \ at 06:00:00 [31]. This project considers that all the computations should be\
    \ available at a\nprecise time, ﬁxed at [d+1 06:00:00]. Each decision regarding\
    \ day d will be valid for an interval of\n24 h: [d+1 06:00:00, d+2 06:00:00[.\n\
    Figure 15 illustrates the time period regarding a RootZoneMoistureLevel deduction.\n\
    The\nphenomenon time represents day d. It is represented by a 24-h interval: [d\
    \ 00:00:00, d+1 00:00:00[.\nIn Figure 15, the time when the result of the deduction\
    \ is available is named the result time. It is ﬁxed\nat [d+1 06:00:00]. This result\
    \ is valid during a period of 24 h named valid time: [d+1 06:00:00,\nd+2 06:00:00[.\n\
    To store the time of the deduction, we use the sosa:resultTime datatype property\
    \ to links the\ndeduction individual to the xsd:dateTime corresponding to the\
    \ result time at [d+1 06:00:00]. This is\npresented in Figure 15.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2020, 10, 1803\n32 of 41\nTo represent the fact that a deduction concerns day\
    \ d, we use the object property\nsosa:phenomenonTime. Day d is represented by\
    \ an instance of the class time:Interval, which is\ndescribed by two instances\
    \ of the class time:Instant:\n•\nOne instance represents the beginning of the\
    \ interval: [d 00:00:00]. The object property\ntime:hasBeginning links the instance\
    \ of time:Interval to the beginning time:Instant instance.\n•\nOne instance represents\
    \ the end of the interval: [d+1 00:00:00]. The instance of time:Interval is\n\
    linked to the ending time:Instant by the object property time:hasEnding.\nEach\
    \ instance of time:Instant has a time:inXSDDateTimeStamp data value, which precisely\
    \ indicates\nthe date and time of the instant.\nThe deduction result for day d\
    \ is valid for 24 h: [d+1 06:00:00, d+2 06:00:00[, i.e., no new\ndeduction will\
    \ be performed during this valid time. The valid time is represented by an instance\
    \ of the\nclass time:Interval, which is associated with two instances of the class\
    \ time:Instant as presented above.\nThe caso:hasValidTime object property, as\
    \ illustrated in Figure 15, links the deduction individual to\nthe valid time.\n\

    5.3. Implementation of the Reasoning Process in the Soil Moisture Workﬂow\nIn\
    \ this case, only one rule is required to determine the state of the RootZoneMoistureLevel\n\
    property. The reason is that all states of the RootZoneMoistureLevel property\
    \ are associated with\nan open upper boundary and a closed lower boundary, as\
    \ shown in Figure 9. In other words,\nFigure 18 shows that all transitions follow\
    \ the same pattern based on an upper and lower boundary:\n“When ( lowerBoundary\

    \ outputs. There are a total of 21 test scenarios:\n•\n14 unit tests: Input values\
    \ are boundary values given by the testers around the threshold. Expected\noutputs\
    \ are manually calculated by the testers using the IRRINOV® method.\n•\n7 sample\

    6. Experimentation\nThe DSS or decision support application is an essential part\
    \ of the smart irrigation CAS. Each day,\nthe DSS produces an irrigation decision\
    \ as a suggestion for farmers. Comparing the results of these\nautomated decisions\
    \ with human decisions enable us to evaluate the DSS. The human decisions made\n\
    by irrigation experts are available in the experimental dataset provided by Arvalis\
    \ and INRAE, as\npresented in Section 4.1.\nThis section ﬁrst describes the methodology\
    \ used to evaluate this DSS. Moreover, a discussion on\nthe limitations of the\
    \ evaluation is raised at the end of this section to highlight the advantages\
    \ and\ndrawbacks of the DSS.\n6.1. Evaluation Methodology\nTo evaluate our system,\
    \ we selected several periods from the original dataset. Those periods\nshould\
    \ have different events that imply state changes in the observed properties. The\
    \ selected periods\nwere as follows:\n•\n[14/08/2013, 21/08/2013]: The period\
    \ has one light rain event.\n•\n[21/08/2013, 03/09/2013]: The period has one moderate\
    \ rain event.\n•\n[31/07/2013, 14/08/2013]: The period has two consecutive moderate\
    \ rain events.\n•\n[22/07/2013, 31/07/2013]: The period has a crop state change\
    \ and two rain events.\nEach period contains two consecutive watering days which\
    \ are the ﬁrst day and the last day\nin the period. For example, in the ﬁrst period\
    \ [14/08/2013, 21/08/2013], the watering days are\n14/08/2013 and 21/08/2013.\n\
    Then, we compared the day of the watering decision made by our DSS from the day\
    \ of the\nwatering decision made by the farmer. The comparison relies on the fact\
    \ that when both the farmer\nand the DSS follow the same rules of the IRRINOV®\
    \ method, then the watering decisions on the same\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n\
    36 of 41\nconditions should be equivalent. Thus, when both the farmer and the\
    \ DSS decide to do a watering on\nthe ﬁrst day of each period, the next watering\
    \ day deduced by the DSS should be the last day of the\nperiod, in line with the\
    \ decision of the farmer.\nPlease note that with each period, the DSS takes the\
    \ human decision of the ﬁrst day as an input.\nIt produces its decision from the\
    \ second day of the period. For example, with the period [14/08/2013,\n21/08/2013],\
    \ the DSS takes the watering decision on day 14/08/2013. It deduces the decisions\
    \ from\nday 15/08/2013 to day 21/08/2013.\n6.2. Result and Analysis\nThe results\
    \ of the experiment over the four mentioned periods are shown in the four data\
    \ tables\nbelow. Each table includes 16 columns and several rows. The ﬁrst row\
    \ of the table contains the labels\nof the type of data in the column. Each one\
    \ from the second row contains the data corresponding to a\nday of the period.\
    \ Details of the ﬁrst row: The ﬁrst 13 cells are ﬁlled in gray to indicate that\
    \ the data in\nthe columns corresponding to these cells are input data; the 14th\
    \ and 15th cells are in red to indicate\nthat the data in the columns corresponding\
    \ to these cells are inferred results. The last cell is in green to\nindicate\
    \ that the data in the 16th column are the decisions of humans in reality. The\
    \ meaning of each\ncolumn is as follows.\n•\nThe ﬁrst three columns show the information\
    \ of the day, month, and year of the date.\n•\nThe fourth column shows the total\
    \ rain quantity of a day. Its unit is mm. When the rain quantity\nis greater than\
    \ 0, the cell is ﬁlled with blue.\n•\nThe ﬁfth column shows the number of delay\
    \ days. These data in this cell are calculated from the\ndata in the fourth column.\
    \ Its unit is the day. When the number of delay days is greater than 0,\nthe cell\
    \ is ﬁlled with blue.\n•\nThe next six cells correspond to six soil tensiometers.\
    \ These indicate the average soil moisture of\na day as measured by a soil tensiometer.\
    \ Its unit is cbar.\n•\nThe 12th cell shows the average root zone moisture of\
    \ a day. The data in this cell are calculated\nbased on the data in the six previous\
    \ cells. Its unit is also cbar.\n•\nThe 13th cell shows the crop state observed\
    \ by a human. If farmers recognize a new crop state\nand put it in the dataset,\
    \ then this state is written by the name code, and the cell is ﬁlled with\nyellow.\
    \ Otherwise, the text entered in the cell is “null”.\n•\nThe 14th cell shows the\
    \ value SleepingDuration inferred by the DSS. Its unit is the day.\n•\nThe 15th\
    \ cell shows the state of the CropWaterNeed. When CropWaterNeed reaches state\
    \ Yes, the\ntext in the cell is in uppercase, and the cell is ﬁlled with red.\n\
    •\nThe 16th cell shows the decision of farmers recorded in the dataset. The day\
    \ that farmers decide\nto water the plot, the corresponding cell is made green,\
    \ and the text inside the cell is “YES”.\nOtherwise, there is no text.\nFigure\
    \ 19 shows the results of the experimental period from 22/07/2013 to 31/07/2013.\
    \ The ﬁrst\nirrigation is performed on 22/07/2013. The farmer decides to schedule\
    \ the second irrigation on\n31/07/2013; however, the DSS suggests that the farmer\
    \ does nothing on the same day. The farmer\ndisobeys the IRRINOV® method in this\
    \ case, and he/she has a good reason. When the value of the\naverage root zone\
    \ moisture is 152 cbar, the root zone moisture level is low. If the root zone\
    \ moisture\nlevel is low and the crop growth is R1, then the crop needs water.\
    \ If following the IRRINOV® methods,\nthe farmer should wait at least two more\
    \ days because a rain event postpones the irrigation by four\ndays. The data of\
    \ SleepingDuration also reﬂect this calculation. The result of this experiment\
    \ proves\nthat the farmer decision may be different from the IRRINOV® method.\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n37 of 41\nFigure 19. DSS experiment during the period\
    \ from 22/07/2013 to 31/07/2013.\nFigure 20 shows the results of the experimental\
    \ period from 31/07/2013 to 14/08/2013. The ﬁrst\nirrigation is performed on 31/07/2013.\
    \ The second irrigation is scheduled by both the farmer and the\nDSS is on 31/07/2013.\
    \ This example shows that the farmer follows the IRRINOV® method and the\nDSS\
    \ gives a correct result based on this method. The DSS result is correct in this\
    \ case because there are\nrains on two consecutive days. The two rainy days are\
    \ 06/08/2013 and 07/08/2013. These two rainy\ndays produce seven delay days.\n\
    Figure 20. DSS experiment during the period from 31/07/2013 to 14/08/2013.\nFigure\
    \ 21 shows the results of the experimental period from 14/08/2013 to 21/08/2013.\
    \ The ﬁrst\nirrigation is performed on 14/08/2013. The second irrigation is scheduled\
    \ by both the farmer and the\nDSS is on 21/08/2013. This example shows that the\
    \ farmer follows the IRRINOV® method and the\nDSS gives a correct result based\
    \ on this method. The DSS result is correct in this case because of the\nlight\
    \ rain on 19/08/2013. There are no delay days in this period.\nFigure 21. DSS\
    \ experiment during the period from 14/08/2013 to 21/08/2013.\nFigure 22 shows\
    \ the results of the experimental period from 21/08/2013 to 03/09/2013. The\n\
    ﬁrst irrigation is performed on 21/08/2013. The farmer decides to schedule the\
    \ second irrigation\non 21/08/2013. However, the second irrigation is scheduled\
    \ by the DSS is two days sooner. From\nthis experiment, it is possible to conclude\
    \ that the farmer disobeys the IRRINOV® method one more\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10,\
    \ 1803\n38 of 41\ntime. However, this time, the reason for the farmer is unclear.\
    \ From the data in the column of average\nroot zone moisture, the root zone is\
    \ at a dry state from 29/08/2013. Therefore, the decision following\nIRRINOV®\
    \ method is better than the decision made by the farmer, since the crops in the\
    \ latter case\nneed to wait for water more than those in the former case.\nFigure\
    \ 22. DSS experiment during the period from 21/08/2013 to 03/09/2013.\n6.3. Discussion\n\
    This section discusses the limitations of the IRRINOV® method, the limitations\
    \ of the Arvalis\ndataset and the limitations of the DSS system.\nFirst, the IRRINOV®\
    \ method is not a complete method for irrigation decisions. IRRINOV®\nprovides\
    \ guidelines for irrigation decisions based on crop variety, soil and region in\
    \ metropolitan\nFrance. This method is only dedicated to climate events that have\
    \ a greater chance of occurring in\nmetropolitan France. For example, the IRRINOV®\
    \ method ignores the fact that in summer, some daily\nrain events with high intensity\
    \ may occur for a long period, such as in tropical climates. Moreover, the\nIRRINOV®\
    \ method provides no guide about the amount of water that must be used for irrigation.\
    \ It\ndoes not take into account that a farmer may have some water restriction\
    \ usages. For example, one\nfarm may be allowed to water a plot only each week\
    \ on Monday morning.\nSecond, the irrigation decision in the Arvalis dataset is\
    \ a human decision, and humans can make\nerrors. For example, the ﬁrst watering\
    \ decision in the Arvalis dataset occurs on 08/07/2013. Following\nthe IRRINOV®\
    \ method, farmers should not water the crop on this day since the crop is at the\
    \ V7 state,\nand moisture sensor measurements do not reach the threshold. Maybe\
    \ the farmer has made an error,\nor maybe he has decided to water the plot sooner\
    \ because he knows that he will not be able to water\nthe plot in subsequent days\
    \ due to water restrictions.\nThird, the DSS provides automatic results that seem\
    \ to contain no errors. Unfortunately, the DSS\nis limited. The IRRIG ontology\
    \ and rules decision is dedicated to a maize crop on a speciﬁc type of soil.\n\
    If the irrigation decision concerns another crop or other soil, all the thresholds\
    \ for crop growth, root\nzone moisture level and crop watering property should\
    \ be changed. However, the rain intensity rule is\nthe same for all the IRRINOV®\
    \ guidelines regardless of the observed crop and type of soil. Thus, rain\nmodeling\
    \ and associated rules can be used. Fortunately, CASO contains the threshold deﬁnitions\n\
    associated with the state of the property. This means that a new ontology should\
    \ be deﬁned for each\ntype of crop and soil as long as some threshold values change.\
    \ However, our rules are generic, and\ntheir updates should be easy to implement.\
    \ Please note that in other systems, such as PLANTS, the\nthresholds are declared\
    \ inside the rules. Therefore, it is more difﬁcult to modify them.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    Precision agriculture needs CASs. A CAS that contains a WSN and a DSS can reduce\
    \ the work\nof farmers but also improve precision in farming activities. This\
    \ paper presents our experience in\ndeveloping a smart irrigation CAS. This system\
    \ has three advantages: (1) it automates a manual\nAppl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1803\n\
    39 of 41\nirrigation method based on the support of specialists and a real experimental\
    \ dataset, (2) it uses\ntwo new ontologies called CASO and IRRIG that extend other\
    \ well-known ontologies such as SSN\nand SAREF, and (3) it provides several rules\
    \ that can work for other similar systems. This paper\nﬁrst describes the methodology\
    \ of CAS development based on ontologies and details each step of\nthe proposed\
    \ methodology. Second, this paper also shares an example of development. Finally,\
    \ an\nevaluation of the DSS in this system is also published.\nA smart irrigation\
    \ CAS is a complex system. This system requires different roles to participate\n\
    and contribute to development, such as system developers, ontologists, farmers\
    \ and agronomists.\nIn developing the DSS, we encountered several challenges.\
    \ First, because of the participation of\ndifferent roles from different domains,\
    \ sharing the same vocabulary and understanding the agronomist\nmodel correctly\
    \ is complicated. Thanks to the SSN ontology and its precise modeling pattern,\
    \ the\ndesign activity produced a clear understanding of the output of each aggregation\
    \ process.\nSecond, the development of a DSS requires the development of ontologies.\
    \ There are many\nmethodologies used to develop an information system and other\
    \ methodologies used to develop an\nontology. To the best of our knowledge, this\
    \ work is the ﬁrst to combine the two types of methodologies.\nIn the case of\
    \ CASO and IRRIG, reusing standard and well-known ontologies was a decision made\n\
    to increase interoperability with other systems and datasets. However, in practice,\
    \ this activity was\nactually time-consuming. When reusing ontologies, one truly\
    \ needs to understand the semantics and\nconsequences behind every axiom and deﬁnition.\
    \ It becomes even more complicated when several\nontologies need to be combined,\
    \ such as SSN/SOSA and SAREF. Based on this experience, it can\nbe stated that\
    \ building an ad hoc model from scratch would require less time and consume fewer\n\
    resources; therefore, the decision of reusing ontologies is based completely on\
    \ whether interoperability\nis a requirement. In other words, should the sensor\
    \ streams be reused by several DSSs?\nThird, the dataset provided by Arvalis is\
    \ limited. Thus, to test the correctness and robustness of\nthe DSS, more datasets\
    \ should be used. As soon as the sensor network can be deployed on some maize\n\
    plots, our DSS will be tested on this new dataset. We plan to perform more experiments\
    \ in 2021.\nFinally, the IRRINOV® method itself cannot cover all situations; for\
    \ example, it does not deﬁne\nthe action when there are consecutive multiple rainy\
    \ days. However, the automatic irrigation system\nneeds a mechanism to address\
    \ this issue. One solution is to use machine learning to train the system\nover\
    \ data of different scenarios. If the training is sufﬁcient, the system can learn\
    \ the action based on\nthe scale of the IRRINOV® method.\nThe DSS is a part of\
    \ a smart irrigation CAS that will be deployed at the experimental INRAE farm\n\
    (The experimental farm is a part of the AgrotechnoPôle, an ecosystem for agricultural\
    \ machines and\ndigital information systems developed by an alliance of several\
    \ organizations and institutes in Europe.\nTwo members of the alliance dedicated\
    \ to develop AgrotechnoPôle are INRAE and LIMOS.) located at\nMontoldre in France.\
    \ In the future, the DSS system will be combined with other components, such as\n\
    networks, sensors and actuators, to form a complete smart irrigation system.\n\

    \ adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the agricultural\nsector,\
    \ smart devices are becoming more prevalent. The availability of new, timely,\
    \ and precise\ndata offers a great opportunity to develop advanced analytical\
    \ models. Therefore, the platform\nused to deliver new developments to the ﬁnal\
    \ user is a key enabler for adopting IoT technology.\nThis work presents a generic\
    \ design of a software platform based on the cloud and implemented\nusing microservices\
    \ to facilitate the use of predictive or prescriptive analytics under different\
    \ IoT\nscenarios. Several technologies are combined to comply with the essential\
    \ features—scalability,\nportability, interoperability, and usability—that the\
    \ platform must consider to assist decision-making\nin agricultural 4.0 contexts.\
    \ The platform is prepared to integrate new sensor devices, perform\ndata operations,\
    \ integrate several data sources, transfer complex statistical model developments\n\
    seamlessly, and provide a user-friendly graphical interface. The proposed software\
    \ architecture is\nimplemented with open-source technologies and validated in\
    \ a smart farming scenario. The growth\nof a batch of pigs at the fattening stage\
    \ is estimated from the data provided by a level sensor installed\nin the silo\
    \ that stores the feed from which the animals are fed. With this application,\
    \ we demonstrate\nhow farmers can monitor the weight distribution and receive\
    \ alarms when high deviations happen.\nKeywords: sensors; Internet of Things;\
    \ microservices architecture; cloud computing; precision\nlivestock farming; smart\
    \ farm; pig farming\n1. Introduction\nDevelopments in the digital era are transforming\
    \ the agricultural industry by making\nits processes more efﬁcient, automated,\
    \ and competitive. The line that separates the virtual\nand the physical world\
    \ is getting closer, and this approximation brings in new paradigms\nand challenges\
    \ to become a full-ﬂedged 4.0 industry. From the Internet of Things (IoT)\nperspective,\
    \ the core idea is that each physical object in the real world is equipped with\n\
    sensors that connect it to the virtual world. Predictive models, prescriptive\
    \ models, or\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can be fed with these data\
    \ enriched with other context\ninformation to generate new insights to assist\
    \ the decision making process. Several inno-\nvations, like sensor technology\
    \ [1,2], positioning systems [3], digital image processing [4],\ncloud [5], and\
    \ fog computing [6], among others, make this transformation possible.\nNowadays,\
    \ the automatic acquisition of data, which is part of the dataﬁcation and\ndigitization\
    \ process, is undertaken in many sectors given that sensors are becoming cheaper\n\
    and more energy-efﬁcient [7]. The value of such data is directly related to the\
    \ use given.\nThe simplest use of the sensor data leads to descriptive analytics,\
    \ and using the information\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21175949\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n2 of 21\nonly in\
    \ this way may not exploit its full potential [8]. Therefore, given that the number\n\
    of devices that can transmit data is increasing, there is a need to improve the\
    \ systems for\ngathering, crossing, and processing the data provided by the different\
    \ sources in order to\nsupport smart decisions.\nTo start with, several challenges\
    \ arise on the data collection process: (a) raw data\ncoming from the sensor may\
    \ be inaccurate or even erroneous due to systematic and random\nerrors; (b) some\
    \ information may be partially lost due to network congestion, continuous\nenvironmental\
    \ interference [9], or long distances in remote places [10]; (c) fraudulent ma-\n\
    nipulation of data by attackers affecting their veracity [11]; (d) some technical\
    \ speciﬁcations\nfrom sensors manufacturers can vary the structure of their data\
    \ and/or their communi-\ncation interface may change [12]; or (e) huge volumes\
    \ of real-time data that traditional\nsystems cannot handle [13] may overload\
    \ the systems, among others. The presence of any\nof these factors requires speciﬁc\
    \ data operations to avoid an inadequate representation [14].\nAnother challenge\
    \ to address is how the multiple types of sources, devices, and other\ninformation\
    \ sources are connected in order to obtain a global vision. Data come from\ndifferent\
    \ installations, places, databases, business information systems and more, each\
    \ with\ntheir own format. Computing platforms and services need to be ﬂexible\
    \ to allow diverse\ndata exchange among internal and external tools.\nWith the\
    \ aim to increase the value of the data collected, data scientists in the ﬁelds\n\
    of Operational Research, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, or Statistics are developing\
    \ advanced\nmodeling techniques. These techniques may rely at some points in solving\
    \ intensive\ncomputational processes regarding CPU (central processing unit) and\
    \ memory, such as\nwhen solving optimization models or training neural networks.\
    \ The management of these\nresources requires platforms where services can scale\
    \ with resource needs.\nMoreover, the human interaction with these complex techniques\
    \ and smart data\ngenerated need to be presented with a user-friendly perspective,\
    \ smoothing the learning\ncurve and providing targeted information. Decision-makers\
    \ need to use these tools with a\nnatural ﬂow to access different information\
    \ levels depending on their roles and decisions.\nTo overcome the challenges exposed\
    \ until now, in this work we propose a generic\nsoftware architecture together\
    \ with guidelines on how to adapt the architecture to different\nIoT scenarios.\
    \ Therefore, the main contributions of this work is the design of a software\n\
    architecture with the following properties:\n•\nSupport the integration of several\
    \ type of sensors, in order to automatically collect\nreal-time data and keep\
    \ historical records, independently of their original format.\n•\nAssist in the\
    \ adoption of methodologies and mechanisms to detect and correct possible\nerrors\
    \ in order to provide the most accurate information.\n•\nThe capability to obtain\
    \ data from other data sources such as databases or web services\namong others\
    \ to complement the sensor data.\n•\nInteroperability between internal and external\
    \ systems.\n•\nThe provision of the needed resources to ensure the correct use\
    \ of the different tools\nand methodologies of the digital platform.\n•\nThe incorporation\
    \ of tools that facilitate the interaction with different complex pro-\ncesses\
    \ and provide new insights to the users.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms to provide the\
    \ needed information and access to the different\nprocesses for the different\
    \ user roles.\n•\nEasy of use, implementation, management, and deployment of the\
    \ architecture into\ndifferent scenarios.\nIn order to validate this architecture\
    \ design, this work presents a case study for the pig\nsector. A platform using\
    \ this software architecture has been implemented. Data collected\nfrom feed silos\
    \ equipped with a level sensor are used to predict the growth of a batch\nof fattening\
    \ pigs. Procedures for data cleaning are integrated in order to provide data\n\
    of quality to proceed with the analysis. To increase the data value, statistical\
    \ models\nare integrated in order to estimate the feed intake and the growth of\
    \ a batch of pigs.\nThe average growth model is based on a sigmoid function from\
    \ the Gompertz family which\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n3 of 21\nuses the accumulated\
    \ feed intake. The distribution is complemented with the estimation\nof the variance\
    \ of the weight of the animals, by using a cubic polynomial function. This\ninformation\
    \ allows the farmer to infer whether the pigs are gaining weight as expected.\n\
    This application also incorporates an alert system to warn the farmer if some\
    \ anomaly\nis detected.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section\
    \ 2 performs a literature review of\nsimilar works. Section 3 presents the design\
    \ of the cloud architecture, the technologies that\nhave been chosen to implement\
    \ it, and how it has been distributed and deployed.\nSection 5 applies this cloud\
    \ platform to a livestock scenario. Finally, Section 6 high-\nlights the main\
    \ conclusions of this work and future research lines.\n2. Bibliography Review\n\
    In this section, we review the state-of-the-art of proposals found in the literature\
    \ that\naddress the design of cloud platform architectures. We limit the scope\
    \ to works in the\nagricultural sector, which is related to our case study. We\
    \ analyze if these works present\nIoT platforms that accomplish a set of characteristics\
    \ that in our opinion are essential for\nIoT scenarios. These characteristics\
    \ are the following:\n1.\nDecision-making assistance: To analyze the type of tools\
    \ included in each work,\nsuch as visualization proposals, the use of predictive\
    \ or prescriptive analysis or the\ngeneration of alarms among others.\n2.\nScalability:\
    \ To analyze if the platform is able to integrate new IoT devices and services\n\
    to meet potentially growing demand.\n3.\nInteroperability: To explore whether\
    \ the architecture is prepared to easily communi-\ncate between different systems\
    \ independently of their technology.\n4.\nPortability: To check whether the architecture\
    \ provides some mechanisms that facili-\ntate the system to be run in different\
    \ environments.\nWe ﬁrst present a brief introduction of the works analyzed. It\
    \ follows a comparison of\nthe characteristics included.\nFerrández-Pastor et\
    \ al. [15] present a platform that can acquire, process, store, and\nmonitor data\
    \ from growing cropping systems with the purpose to automate the mainte-\nnance\
    \ of croplands and control the conditions that determine the proper development\
    \ of\na crop such as soil moisture, water pH level, or luminance. Trilles et al.\
    \ [16] present the\ndesign of an architecture for IoT that manages devices, acquires\
    \ data from such devices, and\nanalyzes and generates events/alerts from these\
    \ data devices. They validate the solution in\nvineyards to monitor environmental\
    \ variables, such as the temperature, air/soil humidity,\nand to help the farmer\
    \ predict the mildew disease.\nTaneja et al. [17] present an IoT platform for\
    \ animal behaviour analysis and health\nmonitoring. Their focus is on different\
    \ parameters of dairy farms to monitor the health of\nthe cows and to detect possible\
    \ anomalies.\nThe work presented by Cambra et al. [18] proposes an innovative\
    \ IoT communication\nsystem used as a low controller irrigation system. It collects\
    \ real-time data such as temper-\nature, humidity, air, rain to monitor it, controls\
    \ the actuators (components that perform\nmechanical actions), and detects dangers\
    \ in the ﬁeld. Codeluppi et al. [19] propose a\nlow-cost, modular IoT platform\
    \ to improve the management of generic farms. Authors\nvalidate the platform in\

    All the analyzed works provide some tools to visualize data (either historical\
    \ sensor\ndata, real-time sensor data, or external services data) and perform\
    \ some management tasks.\nOnly three works present the required tools for IoT\
    \ scenarios so that the data collected can\nprovide extra information: the work\
    \ in [16], where they provide models to detect diseases\nin the crop and generate\
    \ alarms since the farmers can deal with the problem at early stages.\nThe system\
    \ developed by the authors of [18] generates alarms and create actions to deal\n\
    with the adequate growth of the crops, and the solution implemented in [17] provides\n\
    analysis to predict heat detection or anomalies of the cows and generate alarms\
    \ to warn\nthe farmer. Such solutions are mostly self-created platforms. However,\
    \ the method in [15]\nuses the Ubidots IoT platform in order to provide with generic\
    \ and basic visualization and\nanalysis tools.\nFrom a scalability point of view,\
    \ all these works use the cloud computing technology\nin order to obtain the needed\
    \ resources to integrate new services and IoT devices. However,\nthe type of database\
    \ used and how these applications are distributed must be also taken in\nto consideration\
    \ in order for the platform to cope with the new needs of the environment.\nSome\
    \ solutions use relational databases [18,19]. These kinds of databases are not\
    \ change-\ntolerant as they require that the structure of the data is deﬁned before\
    \ storing it, and a small\nupdate in the schema can cause a great deal of modiﬁcations\
    \ in the system that must be\ncarefully controlled. Using NoSQL [17,20] or Time\
    \ series databases [16] is a better choice for\nIoT scenarios due to the heterogeneous\
    \ data of the sensors. For example, NoSQL databases\nprovide ﬂexible schemes that\
    \ allow storing unstructured data without having to predeﬁne\na structure.\nAnother\
    \ important feature is how the different applications of the architecture are\n\
    distributed to ensure that it is able to support potentially growing demands.\
    \ Different\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n5 of 21\napproaches are found: the authors\
    \ of [19] propose a platform that is able to integrate new\nIoT devices and application\
    \ modules according to the demands of farmers. The works\nin [15,17] take some\
    \ responsibilities from the cloud such as computing and analytics in order\nto\
    \ be performed at the edge of the network and provide better time responses. In\
    \ addition,\nin [16,17] the authors present a microservice-based approach in order\
    \ to distribute the IoT\nplatform in a set of services that are responsible for\
    \ performing speciﬁc functionalities and\nare independent from each other.\nWith\
    \ regards to the interoperability, most of the studies take into consideration\
    \ pro-\nviding HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) APIs (Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces) to\nthe services in order to be able to interact with the consumer\
    \ applications. An HTTP API is\nan interface that allows the interaction of two\
    \ applications by using the HTTP protocol. In\naddition, the most used message\
    \ protocol in these works that allows a connection of the\nIoT devices and the\
    \ cloud platform is the MQTT (Message Queueing Telemetry Transport).\nHowever,\
    \ in order to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices, they might require other kinds\n\
    of network protocols. In [16], the authors use RabbitMQ in order to also be able\
    \ to operate\nwith AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) and STOMP (Streaming\
    \ Text Oriented\nMessaging Protocol) clients.\nFinally, there is also the need\
    \ to provide mechanisms that facilitate the use of the\narchitecture into different\
    \ environments and scenarios. The works in [16,17,20] are the\nonly studies that\
    \ provide these facilities. In fact, they use Docker in order to package\nthe\
    \ architecture and its dependencies in order to be deployed in any environment\
    \ with\nthe advantage to select which component might need in order to adapt it\
    \ to a speciﬁc\nIoT scenario.\nAfter analyzing the reviewed works, we ﬁnd that\
    \ there is a gap in solutions that\nprovide generic scalable, portable, and interoperable\
    \ architectures that let integrate models\nin order to take advantage from the\
    \ data collected by the sensors. It is of special importance\nto provide evidence\
    \ in practical applications of the added value that the integration of\nseveral\
    \ sources can provide in the agricultural sector, in general, and the livestock\
    \ sector,\nin particular.\nIn our work, the purpose is to provide guidelines and\
    \ a proof of concept to design ar-\nchitectures that can be reused in different\
    \ IoT scenarios with the adoption of a Microservice\napproach, Docker, and the\
    \ integration of models with a focus in Agricultural contexts.\n3. Architecture\n\
    Basically, in an IoT scenario there are sensors that can share their data through\
    \ the\nInternet and interoperate with cloud platforms, see Figure 1.\nThese sensors\
    \ can give access to their data through APIs or Edge computing nodes.\nUsually,\
    \ in most of the IoT scenarios, sensors provide APIs that allow obtaining their\n\
    last reads (they are updated periodically) in semi-real-time by using the HTTP\
    \ protocol.\nHowever, there are other scenarios where it is required that the\
    \ response time is the lowest\npossible. In order to provide quicker responses,\
    \ there is the need that the processing and\nstorage capabilities of the cloud\
    \ are moved near to these IoT devices, but also to use more\nlightweight protocols\
    \ than HTTP such as MQTT for data transmission to provide real-time\ninteraction.\
    \ Edge computing nodes offer these capabilities. Nevertheless, the resources of\n\
    these computing nodes are limited and in order to store historical data or perform\
    \ complex\ntasks they must also transmit the preprocessed sensor data to the cloud.\
    \ The cloud platform\nis the key to manage the different requirements of IoT scenarios\
    \ such as huge volumes of\nheterogeneous data, security, interoperability, and\
    \ scalability by providing the on-demand\ncomputing resources such as networks,\
    \ databases, servers, storage, and others through the\nInternet thanks to its\
    \ cloud computing infrastructure.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n6 of 21\nFigure 1.\
    \ General Internet of Things (IoT) scenario.\nThis generic cloud architecture\
    \ (Figure 2) has been designed by taking into account the\nrequirements presented\
    \ in Section 1 but with the condition that the cloud platform must be\nconnected\
    \ with third-party APIs or Edge nodes to give response to these input data.\n\
    This cloud architecture comprises three layers (the presentation layer, the logic\
    \ layer,\nand the data layer) and a gateway. The gateway opens the door to the\
    \ cloud platform.\nThus, it sits between the users and a collection of user services.\
    \ The primary purpose of\nthe presentation layer is to provide a user interface\
    \ to collect the user data and display\nthe relevant information to the user.\
    \ The logic layer represents the processes to obtain the\nsensor data, the treatment\
    \ of this heterogeneous data such as data cleaning methodologies,\nthe generation\
    \ of alarms, the execution of different algorithms to obtain valuable data for\n\
    the users, and the interoperability mechanisms to interact with external systems.\
    \ Finally,\nthe data layer is in charge of storing the data that come from different\
    \ sources.\nThese layers are implemented following a microservices architecture\
    \ approach. These\ncollections of services provide the full functionality of the\
    \ cloud platform. As observed\nabove, each service uses its technology stack and\
    \ interoperates between them by using\nlightweight protocols and APIs. Observe\
    \ that if a service needs to be updated, then only\nthis service becomes non-operational\
    \ without affecting the others. Another highlighting\nfeature is that these decoupling\
    \ limits were building the overall platform by using a unique\ntechnology. Instead,\
    \ it can use the adequate technology in order to build a speciﬁc func-\ntionality.\n\
    3.1. Gateway\nThe gateway sits between the users and a collection of user services.\
    \ It decouples\nthe services and allows routing each user request to the right\
    \ place, keeping track of\neverything, and allowing role-based access to the platform\
    \ services. Finally, it adds a\nspeciﬁc component that controls all trafﬁc, and\
    \ external interaction must pass through this\ncomponent. This way reduces the\
    \ complexity to add new services and components and\nreuse these functionalities.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 5949\n7 of 21\nFigure 2. Cloud architecture design.\nThe main\
    \ functionality of the gateway is providing authentication and authorization\n\
    mechanisms. This functionality is provided by the combination of the Shinyproxy\
    \ [22] and\nLDAP services. Shinyproxy is an open-source software that provides\
    \ the authentication\nand authorization mechanisms to deploy Shiny apps in a production\
    \ context.\nThe Shinyproxy service offers a login page that sends the credentials\
    \ to the LDAP\ndirectory service to check if an user exists and the roles that\
    \ the user has assigned to provide\nthe web application that it might require.\
    \ This way, it provides an isolated workspace for\nevery user session by launching\
    \ a Docker container with the web application accessed by\nthe user.\n3.2. Presentation\
    \ Layer\nThe presentation layer is the visible part of the cloud architecture.\
    \ It represents the\ntool that users use to interact with the complex functionalities\
    \ and models they might\nrequire. It is a user-friendly web application that can\
    \ be accessed from any user device\nconnected to the Internet. It hides the complexity\
    \ of the functionalities and operations\nperformed to obtain the desired information.\n\
    The main functionalities of this layer are gathering user input using forms and\
    \ wizards,\nand displaying output data using dashboards and data visualization\
    \ tools. This work\nproposes R Shiny to present the data collected by the sensors\
    \ and the analysis provided by\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n8 of 21\nthe cloud in\
    \ a user-friendly manner. The data are obtained by the REST API offered by the\n\
    Node js web service.\nR Shiny is a package for the R language that facilitates\
    \ the building of interactive web\napps by providing the required components to\
    \ integrate the different analysis developed in\nR in the web without knowing\
    \ Javascript, HTML (HyperText Markup Language), and CSS\n(Cascading Style Sheets).\
    \ It also provides the mechanisms to interoperate with external\nsystems such\
    \ as APIs to obtain and transmit the required information. Therefore, it permits\n\
    agile deployment and maintenance for technical and non-technical users.\n3.3.\
    \ Logic Layer\nThis layer aims to process the data from the presentation layer,\
    \ the sensors, and\nexternal services through deﬁned business operations and query\
    \ the data layer. It acts\nas the bridge that allows communication between the\
    \ presentation layer, the IoT devices,\nthe external services, and the data layer.\
    \ APIs allow interoperating between the different\ncomponents of the architecture\
    \ independently of the technology stack that has been used.\nIt also lets the\
    \ integration of new components to provide more data, such as more sensors,\n\
    external services, and others. Most of the time, these APIs use the REST (Representational\n\
    State Transfer) principles to operate respecting the HTTP protocol and transfer\
    \ the required\nresources by using data formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object\
    \ Notation) and XML\n(Extensible Markup Language). Finally, different scripts\
    \ have been developed to perform\ndata collection and data analysis to extract\
    \ the value of this data and generate alarms. Thus,\nthe main functionalities\
    \ of this layer are as follows:\n•\nData Collection: Collect data periodically\
    \ and store them into the MongoDB database.\n•\nData Cleaning: Detect and correct\
    \ data errors, outliers, or erroneous input data.\n•\nData processing and Analysis:\
    \ Execute predictive and prescriptive models. Trans-\nforming raw data into valuable\
    \ data.\n•\nAlert Notiﬁcation: Inform the users via email about possible problems.\n\
    Most of these actions and functions must be executed periodically, such as data\
    \ collec-\ntion, data cleaning, and data processing. Thus, CRON jobs are implemented\
    \ to automate\nthese executions periodically and make the platform act autonomous.\
    \ The technologies\nthat have been applied to implement these functionalities\
    \ are:\n•\nNode js [23]. Node js is an application runtime environment that allows\
    \ writing\nJavaScript for web applications. It comes with many adequate libraries\
    \ for back-end\ndevelopment, such as ﬁle system management, HTTP streams, or database\
    \ man-\nagement. It has been chosen to develop the web service and implement an\
    \ alert\nnotiﬁcation system since it facilitates dealing with multiple client\
    \ requests and pro-\nvides mechanisms that help scale the applications. The authors\
    \ propose using Node js\nto implement the APIs because they have previous know-how\
    \ and successful projects\nimplemented on it. However, it is possible to choose\
    \ similar technologies such as\nFalcon, Asp.Net, or Spring to develop these APIs.\
    \ The web service is in charge of\nretrieving the data from the database and receiving\
    \ the client’s data to process the\ndata and store it. These data are transmitted\
    \ and received using the JSON format.\nThe communication between the client and\
    \ the web service is made via the REST\nAPI with the HTTP protocol that deﬁnes\
    \ the different CRUD (Create, Read, Update,\nDelete) operations that different\
    \ controllers deﬁne. These controllers can operate with\nthe NoSQL database by\
    \ using a library called mongoose that permits mapping the\nmodels deﬁned by Schemas\
    \ into collections of the database. The alert notiﬁcation\nsystem uses the nodemailer\
    \ library to send emails to the user when the system detects\nan alert.\n•\nPython.\
    \ In order to perform the data collection process, Python has been chosen. It\n\
    provides the mechanisms to perform HTTP calls, MQTT protocol, and query NoSQL\n\
    databases. A Python script has been implemented to collect the sensor data provided\n\
    by an External API and uses a package called pymongo to store the data into the\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 5949\n9 of 21\nNoSQL database. In order to integrate new sensors,\
    \ it would be necessary to develop\nthe corresponding script using the protocol\
    \ that would be required for that sensor.\nNote that Python is one of the most\
    \ powerful scripting languages, but other languages\ncan be used to implement\
    \ these services. The authors suggest using Python because it\nhas a large community\
    \ and several data mining, automation, and big data platforms\nrely on it. Moreover,\
    \ it is versatile, ﬂexible, easy to manage and maintain, and it has a\nvast range\
    \ of libraries available.\n•\nR. In order to perform the data cleaning and analysis,\
    \ R scripts have been developed.\nThese scripts interact with the Web service\
    \ to store the cleaned data and store the\noutputs of the analysis methods. It\
    \ is also possible to implement these services\nwith other programming technologies.\
    \ Nevertheless, the authors suggest using R to\nsimplify the integration with\
    \ the presentation layer and to allow operations research\nexperts to develop\
    \ models and analytics, as R is a language broadly used in this\nresearch ﬁeld.\n\
    The methodology presented relies on sensors with data transmission capabilities\
    \ such\nas HTTP or MQTT. Therefore, the only requirement to add a new sensor to\
    \ the platform is\ndeﬁning the rules to transmit the data using the APIs. Nevertheless,\
    \ this is not a limitation,\nand if the sensors are old-fashioned and do not support\
    \ these protocols or they do not have\ndirect access to the net, a simple solution\
    \ is to add a ﬁle submission microservice to the\nplatform. Then, the manager\
    \ of the sensor can manually submit the readings periodically\nto the platform.\n\
    3.4. Data Layer\nThe data layer is in charge of storing data from the sensors,\
    \ user proﬁles, user roles,\nand data coming from external services, among others.\
    \ This layer needs to be write-\noptimized to handle all the data arriving from\
    \ the devices. Another important feature is\nthat data are alive and can change\
    \ in the future, so the database technology must permit\nthe addition of new data\
    \ types or change the current structure. Therefore, NoSQL is most\nproper for\
    \ this purpose than relational databases.\nMongoDB [24] is an open-source NoSQL\
    \ database oriented to documents and is write-\noptimized. It allows storing unstructured\
    \ data as a document in a representation called\nBSON (Binary JSON) in a collection\
    \ of documents. It provides a dynamic schema that lets\nus build ﬂexible models\
    \ by updating the schema without affecting the other documents.\nThese features\
    \ allow adapting quickly to changes that can be vital when the system starts to\n\
    store huge volumes of data. This database is also designed to support horizontal\
    \ scalability\nachieved by adding new machines and is managed by the cloud computing\
    \ technology\nand provides high-performance to perform simple operations. Finally,\
    \ it also saves costs\nand complexity in comparison to relational databases. These\
    \ features make this database\nideal for IoT scenarios.\nOn the other hand, OpenLDAP\
    \ [25] is an open-source implementation of LDAP that\nallows access to directory\
    \ services. These directories are specialized databases optimized\nfor reading,\
    \ browsing, searching, and simple update operations. These features make these\n\
    databases ideal for providing centralized user administration to store sensitive\
    \ information\nand other users’ account details. Furthermore, to make more accessible\
    \ the management\nof this LDAP directory, an administration user interface is\
    \ provided. LAM provides a\nuser-friendly interface to manage an LDAP directory\
    \ without the need for the administrator\nto manage LDAP entries.\n4. Deployment\n\
    This section explains how the software architecture has been deployed by leveraging\n\
    the advantages of Virtual Machines and container virtualization using Docker.\n\
    Virtual Machines are digital representations of physical computers with their\
    \ Opera-\ntive System and assigned resources (Memory, CPU, storage, and networks)\
    \ created from a\nsoftware component called a hypervisor. This virtualization\
    \ allows the cloud infrastructure\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n10 of 21\nto be split\
    \ up by independent Virtual Machines that can act as different servers by sharing\n\
    the resources managed by the hypervisor. Moreover, Docker can be installed in\
    \ these\nVirtual Machines [26]. Docker is an open platform that allows splitting\
    \ up the applications\nfrom the infrastructure into Docker containers and dealing\
    \ with process isolation. Docker\ncontainers allow separating service and dependencies\
    \ from the underlying operating\nsystem and other containers to avoid dependency\
    \ conﬂicts. All these containerized appli-\ncations share a unique operating system,\
    \ so it permits saving resources and it is also faster\nto be started and stopped\
    \ than Virtual Machines that need each one an Operative System.\nThe cloud platform\
    \ chosen to develop this work is OpenNebula. This is an enterprise-\nready platform\
    \ that helps build an Elastic Private Cloud. It avoids risks and vendor lock-in\n\
    by choosing a powerful but easy-to-use, open-source solution. OpenNebula is based\
    \ on\nvirtual machines but also allows containerized applications from Docker\
    \ to be run.\nOpenNebula offers an open and transparent means to build private\
    \ clouds. The Stormy\nserver [27] is a legacy private cloud platform supported\
    \ by public funding, developed and\nmaintained by the authors’ research group\
    \ aimed at assisting researchers and deployed\nwith OpenNebula and KVM. There\
    \ are several manuscripts, such as that in [28] or in [29],\nthat use the Stormy\
    \ service as a support platform to achieve their goals. Nevertheless,\nthis architecture\
    \ is not limited to this cloud provider as it has been given the needed\nmechanisms\
    \ to be reused in different environments such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nor\
    \ Google Cloud.\nConcretely, we have instantiated different virtual machines using\
    \ a Centos7 OS image\nto host the different microservices. Each virtual machine\
    \ is protected with a ﬁrewall. All the\nmicroservices are deployed and managed\
    \ using container-based virtualization (Docker).\nThis containerization allows\
    \ this architecture to be scaled and reused so it can replace\nthe services used\
    \ in this architecture for the speciﬁc services and its suitable technologies\n\
    to implement the speciﬁc IoT scenario and also the environment where these services\n\
    are deployed but also duplicate the services that require more availability. Therefore,\
    \ it\nfacilitates that this cloud architecture can be reused in any environment\
    \ and is prepared to\ntake advantage of autoscaling policies provided by Kubernetes\
    \ or other cloud orchestrators.\nFigure 3 depicts a general-purpose deployment\
    \ into a cloud provider (OpenNebula,\nAmazon Web Services or Google Cloud). First,\
    \ it is conﬁgured the virtual resources into the\ncloud provider (CPU, Memory\
    \ and Networks). Then, the operating system (Centos7 in our\ndeployment) is installed\
    \ to each virtual machine deployed together with all the required\ntools (Docker\
    \ and Git). Next, an orchestrator is installed and conﬁgured. Our deployment\n\
    uses docker-compose, but other alternatives that can be used are Kubernetes, docker-\n\
    swarm, among others. In parallel, the development environment can be conﬁgured\
    \ in a\nlocal machine to implement and test the services and the applications.\
    \ Then, to integrate\nthe development and production environments, GitHub is used\
    \ (push and pull actions).\nFinally, the docker build commands are employed to\
    \ create the images, and to run and\nexecute all the services the docker-compose\
    \ up commands are used.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n11 of 21\nVersion September 1,\

    \ 3. Block diagram of the deployment of the architecture.\nThe application we\
    \ have developed leverages the information provided by a low-cost sensor installed\n\
    394\nin a silo to infer the feed consumption and from this information compute\
    \ the expected growth.\n395\nThe primary use of a sensor installed in a silo is\
    \ to provide information on the amount of feed\n396\navailable to guide the farmer\
    \ on the replenishment order. However, this information can provide\n397\nextra\
    \ value if it is combined with other information. For example, feed manufacturers\
    \ may plan better\n398\ntheir operations if they know the inventory levels of\
    \ their clients [36]. From a farmer perspective, the\n399\nenrichment of statistical\
    \ growth models with sensor data that estimates the feed intake may provide\n\
    400\nvaluable estimates of the expected growth evolution of a batch of pigs. Monitoring\
    \ the animals’ growth\n401\nis relevant to support the optimal moment for delivering\
    \ the pigs to the abattoir and to detect abnormal\n402\ndeviations between the\
    \ theoretical expected growth curve and the estimated growth based on sensor\n\
    403\ndata. Such deviations may reveal the occurrence of some (sanitary, feed quality,\
    \ ...) problem if the\n404\nestimated curve is slower or reﬂect the result of\
    \ a good practice if the growth is faster.\n405\nFigure 3. Block diagram of the\
    \ deployment of the architecture.\n5. Case Study\nThe rate of adoption of sensor\
    \ technologies varies among sectors, and it is related\nto the trade-off between\
    \ the costs and potential beneﬁts. In particular, the agricultural\nsector uses\
    \ different sensors to measure and track the evolution of several environmental\n\
    characteristics such as soil humidity, air temperature or CO2 concentrations,\
    \ among others.\nThis type of information is relevant to guide the decisions on\
    \ the best actuation at each\nmoment. The data analysis that stems from this information\
    \ usually falls in the descriptive\narea. With the IoT platform presented, we\
    \ aim to facilitate the development, usage and\nadoption of applications involving\
    \ advanced modeling techniques for the agricultural\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n\
    12 of 21\nsector. In this way, new developments from the Operations Research or\
    \ the Artiﬁcial Intel-\nligence communities such as prescriptive optimization\
    \ models [30], predictive statistical\nmodels [31] or classiﬁcation models [32],\
    \ among others may be easily transferred to the\nﬁnal users.\nThe current case\
    \ study applies the described cloud architecture to build a smart\napplication\
    \ that estimates the growth of pigs based on the amount of feed discharged from\n\
    the silo, where a sensor is installed. Pork is one of the most consumed meats\
    \ in the world\ntogether with poultry [33]. It is estimated that between 60% and\
    \ 70% of the total production\ncost per kilogram of pork corresponds to feed consumption\
    \ [34], being the information\nrelated to the feed a key characteristic to monitor\
    \ and control. This application has been\ndeveloped within a demonstration project\
    \ with the participation of three farmers and a\ntotal of eight silos monitored\
    \ and sixteen batches analyzed (composed of 500–900 animals\nper batch). The capacity\
    \ of the silos monitored ranged from 11,000 kg to 16,000 kg.\nThe interest in\
    \ estimating (and better understanding) the growth of a batch of pigs is\none\
    \ of the key breakthroughs that the pig sector is working on. Some approaches\
    \ go in the\nline of precision feeding where individual data on feed intake and\
    \ weight is monitored\neach time an animal visits the feeding station [35]. While\
    \ this system offers accurate and\ncomprehensive information, it is still an expensive\
    \ option. At the other end, traditional pig\nmanagement software offers estimates\
    \ on the expected growth based on estimates from\nprevious batches. An estimation\
    \ of the feed consumed is built from these parameters and\nthen compared with\
    \ the loads performed during the growth. However, the interest of\nmonitoring\
    \ the feed dynamics is increasing and other solutions are being implemented.\n\
    The application we have developed leverages the information provided by a low-cost\n\
    sensor installed in a silo to infer the feed consumption and from this information\
    \ compute\nthe expected growth.\nThe primary use of a sensor installed in a silo\
    \ is to provide information on the amount\nof feed available to guide the farmer\
    \ on the replenishment order. However, this information\ncan provide extra value\
    \ if it is combined with other information. For example, feed\nmanufacturers may\
    \ better plan their operations if they know the inventory levels of their\nclients\
    \ [36]. From a farmer’s perspective, the enrichment of statistical growth models\n\
    with sensor data that estimate the feed intake may provide valuable estimates\
    \ of the\nexpected growth evolution of a batch of pigs. Monitoring the animals’\
    \ growth is relevant to\nsupport the optimal moment for delivering the pigs to\
    \ the abattoir and to detect abnormal\ndeviations between the theoretical expected\
    \ growth curve and the estimated growth based\non sensor data. Such deviations\
    \ may reveal the occurrence of some (sanitary, feed quality,\netc.) problem if\
    \ the estimated curve is slower or reﬂect the result of a good practice if the\n\
    growth is faster.\nIn the following sections, the application that estimates the\
    \ weight evolution of the\npigs in a fattening farm based on the estimate of the\
    \ feed consumption is presented. We\nﬁrst explain the process to integrate several\
    \ sources of data with the predictive models,\nthe characteristics of the farm,\
    \ the sensor technology used, the growth models, and the user-\nfriendly interface\
    \ that allows to easily obtain the information. The resulting application\ncan\
    \ be accessed from https://gcd007.udl.cat/login (version 31 August 2021) and the\n\
    functionalities can be explored with a demonstration test set for a user (username:\
    \ demo)\nwith password (demo@alba25.udl.cat). Note that some functionalities are\
    \ disabled for this\ndemonstration user.\n5.1. Process Description\nIn a three-site\
    \ system, pig production is divided in three stages: (a) maternity, where\nthe\
    \ piglets are born and stay there for 4–5 weeks; (b) rearing, where young pigs\
    \ are grown\nup to the age of 8–10 weeks; and (c) fattening, where the pigs are\
    \ grown for 17–20 weeks\nuntil they reach a target marketing weight and then are\
    \ sent to the abattoir. In this\napplication, our target is to estimate the growth\
    \ at the fattening stage. Figure 4 shows the\nmain steps of the data ﬂow process,\
    \ from the data acquisition to the ﬁnal growth estimate.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n\
    13 of 21\nThe data sources are the sensor measures and some technical parameters\
    \ of the batch of\npigs which are combined to provide an estimate of the average\
    \ feed consumption per\nanimal. The literature provides functions that relate\
    \ the average consumption of pigs\nwith the expected growth. The expected average\
    \ weight is ﬁnally modeled as a weight\ndistribution, so the farmer has a week\
    \ by week estimation of the number of animals that\nare expected to be in each\
    \ weight range.\nSILO CONTENTS\nBATCH\nINFORMATION\nFEED\nCONSUMPTION\nGROWTH\n\
    ESTIMATION\nFigure 4. General data ﬂow process.\nDue to sanitary reasons, the\
    \ animals at the fattening stage are grown in batches where\nno new animals can\
    \ enter the farm before the last animal from the previous batch has left\nand\
    \ the farm is sanitized. However, the entrance and removal of animals can happen\
    \ on\ndifferent days. The application shows information for a particular batch,\
    \ which is deﬁned\nwith the earliest entrance of animals. For each entrance, the\
    \ date, number of piglets, and\nthe average weight needs to be speciﬁed by the\
    \ farmer in an input form. This is the basic\ninformation the farmer obtains for\
    \ each truck of piglets received.\nAt the entrance, piglets may not have a homogeneous\
    \ weight nor age. Furthermore,\nthe growth rate of each animal will be different\
    \ and therefore some animals will reach the\ntarget weight earlier than others.\
    \ When a sufﬁcient number of animals (which is related to\nthe truck capacity)\
    \ reach the marketing weight, those animals are sent to the abattoir. It\nis customary\
    \ that the marketing window comprises four or ﬁve weeks. When a group of\nanimals\
    \ is sent to the abattoir, the farmer is expected to inform of the number of animals\n\
    removed and the weight reported by the abattoir. Having the information on the\
    \ number\nof animals present in the farm is very relevant so the application can\
    \ compute the average\nindividual feed intake more accurately.\n5.1.1. Feed Consumption\
    \ Estimation\nThe driver information for estimating the amount (in kg) of feed\
    \ consumption of the\nbatch is provided by the sensor. By monitoring the silo\
    \ level, we can infer the amount of\nfeed that the batch is consuming. We assume\
    \ that the amount of feed discharged from the\nsilo is consumed by the animals\
    \ disregarding any lost it may happen due to rejection or\nwaste. There exists\
    \ several solutions in the market for remotely monitoring a silo contents.\nA\
    \ direct approach to know the silo’s content weight is to install load cells in\
    \ the silo support\nstructure [37]. This is the most precise approach but for\
    \ already installed silos, it demands a\ncostly installation. An indirect approach\
    \ is to use level or surface sensors, which are based\non radar, laser or other\
    \ type of guided wave technology which provides information on the\nvolume of\
    \ the silo that is occupied. Therefore, the weight of the feed in a silo needs\
    \ to be\napproximated by combining the measure of the sensor with the feed density.\
    \ These type of\nsensors are usually placed at the top of the silo and require\
    \ minimal installation. They are\nusually powered by a solar cell which removes\
    \ the need to be connected to a power grid.\nIn this work, the sensor used is\
    \ a wireless one-point level sensor developed by Mon-\nitoring Control Systems\
    \ [38] based on laser technology. In order to compute the level,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 5949\n14 of 21\nit takes into account the height of the silo and it uses\
    \ a time-of-ﬂight computation to a\nspeciﬁc point, usually the center of the silo.\
    \ Then, it measures the time that the laser beam\n(Class II laser, <1 mW, 635\
    \ nm) uses to go to this speciﬁc point and to come back (see\nFigure 5). This\
    \ type of sensor is appropriate for small and medium bins with up to a range\n\
    of 40 m, such as those used to store feed for animals; otherwise, it may suffer\
    \ from lack\nof accuracy. The reading is done periodically; in this work, an automated\
    \ CRON job is\nexecuted every two hours. This reading is sent through a radio\
    \ network of wide coverage\nand low electricity consumption (Sigfox network [39])\
    \ to the company platform called\nDigitplan. We access this information through\
    \ a REST API in order obtain the silo data via\nHTTP protocol.\n5.1.1. Feed consumption\
    \ estimation\n439\nThe driver information for estimating the amount (in kg) of\
    \ feed consumption of the batch is\n440\nprovided by the sensor. By monitoring\
    \ the silo level we can infer the amount of feed that the batch is\n441\nconsuming.\
    \ We assume that the amount of feed discharged from the silo is consumed by the\
    \ animals\n442\ndisregarding any lost it may happen due to rejection or waste.\
    \ There exists several solutions in the\n443\nmarket for remotely monitoring a\
    \ silo contents. A direct approach to know the silo’s content weight is\n444\n\
    to install load cells in the silo support structure [37]. This is the most precise\
    \ approach but for already\n445\ninstalled silos, it demands a costly installation.\
    \ An indirect approach is to use level or surface sensors\n446\nwhich are based\
    \ on radar, laser or other type of guided wave technology which provides information\n\
    447\non the volume of the silo that is occupied. Therefore, the weight of the\
    \ feed in a silo needs to be\n448\napproximated by combining the measure of the\
    \ sensor with the feed density. These type of sensors are\n449\nusually placed\
    \ at the top of the silo and require minimal installation. They are usually powered\
    \ by a\n450\nsolar cell which removes the need to be connected to a power grid.\n\
    451\nFeed level\nLaser \nSilometric\nsensor\nFigure 5. Diagram of the spatial\
    \ distribution of the sensor in the silo. Technical details can be found on\n\
    the manufacturer web page [38].\nIn this work, the sensor used is a wireless one-point\
    \ level sensor developed by Monitoring Control\n452\nSystems [38] based on laser\
    \ technology. In order to compute the level, it takes into account the height\n\
    453\nof the silo and it uses a time-of-ﬂight computation to a speciﬁc point, usually\
    \ the center of the silo\n454\nThen it measures the time that the laser beam (Class\
    \ II laser, <1mW, 635 nm.) uses to go to this speciﬁc\n455\npoint and to come\
    \ back (see Figure 5). This type of sensor is appropriate for small and medium\
    \ bins\n456\nwith up to a range of 40 meters, such as those used to store feed\
    \ for animals, otherwise it may suffer\n457\nfrom lack of accuracy. The reading\
    \ is done periodically, in this work an automated CRON job is\n458\nexecuted every\
    \ two hours. This reading is sent through a radio network of wide coverage and\
    \ low\n459\nelectricity consumption (Sigfox network [39]) to the company platform\
    \ called Digitplan. We access this\n460\ninformation through a REST API in order\
    \ obtain the silo data via HTTP protocol.\n461\nThe information provided by the\
    \ sensor is therefore a measure of volume which needs to be\n462\ntransformed\
    \ to weight (see Figure 6). For doing so, we need to know the density of the feed\
    \ which is\n463\ndifferent for each truckload that reﬁlls the silo. This characteristic\
    \ demands to control for the points in\n464\nwhich the reading increases due to\
    \ the feed reﬁlling operation. To reduce inaccuracies, it is expected\n465\nthat\
    \ the farmer introduces the real weight of the added quantity. The system assumes\
    \ a default density\n466\nand by comparing the estimation of the amount introduced\
    \ according to the default value and the real\n467\nvalue provided, a more precise\
    \ estimation of the density can be done. The weight of the contents of the\n468\n\
    silo is estimated by multiplying the occupied volume of the silo times the density\
    \ of the feed.\n469\nTo approximate the amount of feed supplied to the batch would\
    \ sufﬁce to subtract two consecutive\n470\nreadings expressed as weight. However,\
    \ the process of discharging the feed from the silo leaves\n471\nFigure 5. Diagram\
    \ of the spatial distribution of the sensor in the silo. Technical details can\
    \ be found\non the manufacturer web page [38].\nThe information provided by the\
    \ sensor is therefore a measure of volume which needs\nto be transformed to weight\
    \ (see Figure 6). For doing so, we need to know the density of the\nfeed which\
    \ is different for each truckload that reﬁlls the silo. This characteristic demands\n\
    to control for the points in which the reading increases due to the feed reﬁlling\
    \ operation.\nTo reduce inaccuracies, it is expected that the farmer introduces\
    \ the real weight of the\nadded quantity. The system assumes a default density,\
    \ and by comparing the estimation of\nthe amount introduced according to the default\
    \ value and the real value provided, a more\nprecise estimation of the density\
    \ can be done. The weight of the contents of the silo is\nestimated by multiplying\
    \ the occupied volume of the silo times the density of the feed.\nSensor Reading\

    from the silo leaves the surface uneven making the readings ﬂuctuate among consecutive\n\

    \ within any two reﬁlling operations).\nDue to this reason, data cleaning is done\
    \ by means of a centered moving average. Punctual\nmissing data are also interpolated\
    \ using this procedure. Figure 7 illustrates some of the data\ncleaning procedures\
    \ that the application automatically performs. The dots show the days\nand the\
    \ amount in which the silo was reﬁlled. By default, the application assumes a\

    \ real weight of the\nreﬁlling load. Then, the series of the weight with the reﬁlling-based\

    There exists other sensors on the market that could be used instead of the sensor\n\
    presented [40,41]. Each sensor can use different technologies (radar, 3D level\
    \ sensor, etc.)\nto provide information on the ﬁlled volume and each manufacturer\
    \ provide access to the\ncollected data in a speciﬁc way. The platform allows\
    \ to include different scripts to import\ndata such that the different sensors\
    \ can easily be included. Other solutions directly weight\nthe feed unloaded [42]\
    \ which eliminates the need to perform the transformation from\nvolume to weight,\
    \ and only the data cleaning step should be performed.\nOnce the point reading\
    \ is cleaned, the accumulated weekly consumption is estimated\n(see Figure 8).\
    \ This estimated consumption based on the sensor readings is compared with\na\
    \ theoretical accumulated feed consumption which is computed according to technical\n\
    parameters that reﬂects usual patterns of the farm and the breed of animals that\
    \ hosts. These\nparameters are provided by the user and are the average daily\
    \ gain (ADG), the expected\nfeed conversion rate (FCR), and the age (in weeks).\
    \ Among the alternatives to estimate\nthe expected accumulated feed intake (AFI)\
    \ for a batch of N animals at week t [43],\nthe exponential function is used:\n\
    AFIt = N\nA\n1 + exp −(b · aget)\n(1)\nwhere A is the expected amount of feed\
    \ taken at adult age and b is a ﬁtted constant.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n16 of\
    \ 21\nFigure 8. Cumulative feed intake of the animals in the batch.\n5.1.2. Growth\
    \ Estimation\nSeveral empirical models exist to estimate the growth curve for\
    \ the average population\nby estimating the average weight along the time. However,\
    \ the average weight of a group\nof pigs is comprised of individuals with differing\
    \ performance levels and individual growth\ncurves. Empirically is observed that\
    \ as live weight increases, weight variation between the\npigs also increases.\
    \ Therefore, from a farmer’s point of view, the distribution of the weight\nconveys\
    \ better information. In this work, a growth curve from the Gompertz family [44]\n\
    has been used to estimate the average weight (AW) of the population at a particular\
    \ week t:\nAWt = A exp− exp(b−k·AFIt)\n(2)\nwhere AWt is the average body weight\
    \ (kg) at week t, A is the asymptotic adult body\nweight (kg), b is an empirically\
    \ ﬁtted parameter that makes the starting point ﬂexible, k is\nan empirically\
    \ ﬁtted parameter related to the rate of growth, and AFIt is the average accu-\n\
    mulated feed intake (kg) up to week t. Given that a batch may be composed by subgroups\n\
    of animals, one for each entry, Equation (2) is applied to each subgroup. Figure\
    \ 9 shows\nthe expected weight for each entry of the batch at a speciﬁc point\
    \ in time, computed with\nthe average feed intake according to the theoretical\
    \ function and also with the estimated\ndata from the sensor. This information\
    \ has commercial signiﬁcance, as deviations between\nthose curves alert the farmer\
    \ to review the animals in order to ﬁnd the cause of the de-\nviance. However,\
    \ before diving into the causes, data accuracy has to be veriﬁed. When\na signiﬁcant\
    \ deviation between the theoretical and sensor-based estimations is detected,\n\
    an alert message is sent to the farmer to verify that the data corresponding to\
    \ the weight of\nthe silo’s reﬁlling information have been provided.\nThe distribution\
    \ of the weight at a particular point in time is represented by a Normal\ndistribution\
    \ with the mean according to Equation (2) and variance computed from a cubic\n\
    polynomial function. To provide a better picture of the weight of the animals\
    \ in the batch, all\nthe subgroups distributions are merged to compose the ﬁnal\
    \ weight distribution. Figure 10\nshows the weight distribution at a particular\
    \ week with the expected number of animals\nwithin a 5 kg range. This information\
    \ is especially relevant to plan the delivery of animals\nto the abattoir based\
    \ on a target weight.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n17 of 21\nFigure 9. Animal average\
    \ weight.\nFigure 10. Animal weight distribution in a speciﬁc week.\n5.1.3. Data\
    \ Input Process\nThe reading and data processing of the sensor data are automated\
    \ within the appli-\ncation. Other information related to the batch is required\
    \ to be provided by the farmer.\nIn its current state of development, the user\
    \ must perform a manual entry. This is gen-\neral information to set up a batch,\
    \ inventory information about the number of animals\npresent in the farm either\
    \ entrances or departures, and the information on the reﬁlling\ntruck loads. The\
    \ reader is invited to explore this information with the demo user provided\n\
    in the application.\nThe application also includes a descriptive (and simpliﬁed)\
    \ view to monitor the\navailable feed in the silo. It shows an already processed\
    \ range of historical data corrected\nby the density estimates and it is compared\
    \ with the cleaned series.\n5.2. Deployment\nFigure 11 shows the deployment of\
    \ the architecture explained in Section 4 applied to\nthe case study. This proof\
    \ of concept is deployed using two virtual machines (VM1 and\nVM2) under OpenNebula\

    \ concludes by arguing the current need for designing architectures that\nsupport\
    \ evolving and emerging sensors and devices to facilitate digital transformation\
    \ in\nagricultural contexts. The ﬁndings of this study can be understood as general\
    \ guidelines\nof features to be taken into account when designing Information\
    \ Technology solutions to\nassist agriculture. These guidelines are more consistent\
    \ with current research showing that\nmost features and requirements are standard\
    \ in other industrial sectors.\nNevertheless, in this study, we shed light on\
    \ the challenges and issues of applying\nthese methodologies and Fog, Edge, and\
    \ Cloud paradigms to agricultural scenarios.\nOne of these requirements is to\
    \ deal with the heterogeneous data of sensors and\nexternal services to connect\
    \ the physical and virtual worlds. Broadly translated, the state-\nof-the-art\
    \ ﬁndings indicate that this requirement can be solved by using Fog and Edge\n\
    paradigms or developing scripts in the cloud side (as we propose) that can be\
    \ worth\noperating with these devices by using the corresponding protocol such\
    \ as HTTP and MQTT\nand storing the data into NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.\n\
    Furthermore, another important characteristic that must provide the cloud platform\
    \ is\nscalability. We have shown how a modular design using a microservice approach\
    \ helps\nin adjusting the computational resources on demand. Therefore, we show\
    \ how container\ntechnologies such as Docker can integrate more sensors, analysis\
    \ methods, and services,\nand provide horizontal scaling.\nSensors 2021, 21, 5949\n\
    19 of 21\nTogether, the present study conﬁrms that Docker technology also facilitates\
    \ the porta-\nbility and interoperability of the platform to other IoT scenarios\
    \ and Cloud providers by\nonly installing this technology into the cloud. Moreover,\
    \ there is also the need to provide\nsecurity mechanisms such as roles and authentication\
    \ to provide access to the needed tools\nand prevent undesired access to the platform.\n\
    The case study shows a practical implementation of the ideas presented in this\
    \ work\nwhere all the architecture and the application is developed with open-source\
    \ initiatives.\nThe application shows a way to enhance the value of the data gathered\
    \ by a sensor level\nin a silo from where a batch of pigs are fattened. While\
    \ special care has been taken in the\ndesign of a general and ﬂexible architecture\
    \ so that it can receive data from other sensor\nmanufacturers, much attention\
    \ has also been paid to the integration of advanced modeling\ntools, such as the\
    \ growth model. Note that the code developed at the modeling stage\nwith the R\
    \ statistical software was easily transferred to the platform development team,\n\
    allowing a ﬂuid ﬂow of work. Although the application is focused to the livestock\
    \ sector,\nthe conceptual architecture presented is general and applicable to\
    \ other agro-industrial\nprocesses. We leave as a future work, performing a proof\
    \ of concept of the methodologies\nin other settings.\nFinally, regarding future\
    \ work, we are interested in integrating new kinds of sensors\nto analyze critical\
    \ tasks for the case study that can be assigned to Edge Nodes and provide\nnew\
    \ analysis to provide valuable output. Functionality that would be interesting\
    \ to\nintegrate would be registering IoT devices to the platform by using, for\
    \ example, QR\n(Quick Response) codes and the conﬁguration/management of these\
    \ devices to control\nproprietary devices. From a user perspective, having a push\
    \ notiﬁcation complement would\nenhance the reception of alarms. This and other\
    \ characteristics may be included in future\ndevelopments. Another exciting characteristic\
    \ for IoT scenarios is product traceability that\ncan be implemented by leveraging\
    \ Blockchain technologies. Furthermore, to improve the\nanalysis performance,\
    \ a processing distributed framework such as Apache Spark could be\nintegrated\
    \ to provide support for R and Python programming to provide complex analysis\n\
    with huge amounts of data.\nAuthor Contributions: J.M.-F., A.P.-B. and L.M.P.-A.\

    Abstract: Smart Farming (SF) is an emerging technology in the current agricultural
    landscape. The

    aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming
    operations to improve

    yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach
    that can

    mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The
    inﬂux of data from

    various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the ﬁeld

    of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs)
    such as machine

    learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in
    agriculture is crucial

    for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing
    global population.

    In this study, we review the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of Smart Farming,
    which include novel

    use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated
    with the adoption

    of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis
    of the general

    sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating
    YouTube

    comments and making use of the pattern library. Preliminary ﬁndings of our study
    indicate that,

    though there are several barriers to the implementation of SF tools, further research
    and innovation

    can alleviate such risks and ensure sustainability of the food supply. The exploratory
    sentiment

    analysis also suggests that most digital users are not well-informed about such
    technologies.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture is an indispensable ﬁeld of study, as the continued survival of the
    human

    race depends on it. New and updated technology has been implemented throughout
    the

    ages in order to improve agricultural output and sustainability. The world’s population
    is

    expected to grow to approximately 9.7 billion by the year 2050 [1]. To keep up
    with this

    increase in population, food production needs to go up by 70%. However, the resources

    available to produce the required food output are steadily decreasing due to climate
    change

    and an increase in the number of settlements. Water levels are receding, arable
    lands are

    shrinking, and the environment is being rapidly degraded. The agricultural industry
    is

    also one the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases. The strain on the availability
    of

    food across the world is predicted to increase drastically with the increase in
    the world

    population over the next few decades [2,3]. Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth agricultural

    revolution, was discussed by the World Government Summit in 2018 in the report
    titled

    ‘Agriculture 4.0—The Future of Farming Technology’ [4]. The report highlights
    the need for

    demand in

    coming years. It would be nearly impossible to keep up with this increase in demand
    with-

    out the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and disruptive

    technologies (DTs) such as remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning,
    big

    data, etc., into the agricultural industry. Smart Farming is of great interest
    to researchers

    and scientists as it has yielded great results in reducing the ecological footprint
    of farm-

    ing [5], improving production efﬁciency [6], reducing human labor through unmanned

    vehicles [7,8], detecting diseases through image processing [9,10], and more.

    Precision farming is an approach that utilizes ICTs to monitor resources such
    as

    crops, ﬁelds, and animals [11]. It aims to maximize resource usage and crop yield
    while

    minimizing associated costs. The agricultural sector consumes a signiﬁcant amount
    of

    resources in the form of water, land, fertilizer, and energy. Precision farming
    is concerned

    with calculating the exact amount of resources required to grow plants and sustain
    livestock.

    Smart Farming (SF), which could be considered an extension of precision farming,
    focuses

    on utilization of data obtained from precision farming in an intelligent way and
    making crop

    production more efﬁcient by predicting crop yield [12,13], reducing wastage of
    resources,

    automating tasks [14], and providing agricultural management support [15]. It
    can also

    be used to perform soil analysis [16], so that crops of optimal quality can be
    grown. There

    have been several calamities in recent years that occurred due to climate change
    [17]. In

    light of these calamities, there is great need for smart farming to help manage
    agricultural

    activities. Due to the various risks and external factors associated with farming,
    such as

    weather extremities and plant diseases, implementation of data-driven predictive
    tools,

    which can be used to provide insights into farming operations such as crop yield,
    feed

    intake, weather conditions, soil conditions, etc., is crucial for mitigation [18].
    Decisions can

    thereby be made based on real-time data rather than heuristic, thumb-rule data.

    The availability of huge amounts of data from Internet of things (IoT) devices
    has

    allowed for application of big-data tools. The development of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
    (AI)

    tools has impacted the efﬁciency of a number of tasks associated with farming,
    suggesting

    that data-driven agriculture is a good approach to ensure agricultural sustainability.
    Cli-

    mate change is predicted to disproportionately impact smallholder farmers [19].
    Even a

    temperature variation of a few degrees will drastically affect smallholder farmers
    who are

    not adequately prepared for the situation. A substantial amount of crop losses
    occur due to

    weather events, which can be greatly mitigated through predictive weather modeling.
    This

    approach can help farmers navigate the agricultural risks that arise from the
    unprecedented

    deterioration of the environment, social and economic changes in the industry,
    and the

    increase in demand for food production. The availability of big data has the potential
    to

    revamp the entire food supply chain [20]. A global connectivity chain in farming
    will allow

    for the use of correctly priced products, better market positioning, and improved
    means of

    production. The use of ICT in farming will provide greater insight and advice
    on agricul-

    tural practices to farmers. The increase in visibility that comes with inter-connectivity
    of

    the supply chain is also likely to improve the productivity and conﬁdence of farmers
    in

    such practices.

    Agricultural tasks such as fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,
    seed

    planting, etc., can be automated through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

    and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) [21]. Robots can be trained to autonomously

    plant saplings and move heavy pots, thus complementing human effort in the agricultural

    industry and reducing the farmer’s workload [22]. Autonomous vehicles never tire
    and can

    work around the clock. They also provide better accuracy and speed to improve
    the size of

    yields. With computer vision, autonomous vehicles can identify if the crops are
    ripe, ready,

    and disease-free. Lightweight sensors can be deployed on aerial vehicles to collect
    detailed

    information about crops and soil parameters through hyper-spectral imaging [23].
    Sensors

    can also be used to map various parameters such as type of land, crop, vegetation
    index,

    chlorophyll index, and water index [24]. Drones can help to create a precision
    map of a ﬁeld

    so that each part can precisely receive the resources it needs [25]. IoT is a
    major enabling

    technology that allows communication between the various sensors installed on
    the farm.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    426

    IoT makes use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), which can collect a large amount
    of

    data about the environment, crop production, cattle monitoring, and more [26].
    Information

    generated by IoT devices allows farmers to track farm operations and performance,
    and

    make informed decisions to improve farm productivity and yield. The massive amounts
    of

    data collected from the WSNs can be analyzed through technologies such as big
    data and

    deep learning. These technologies provide the added advantages of predictive modeling,

    real-time decision making, and adaptability to external factors. With the number
    of smart

    devices increasing steadily, the implementation of IoT in farms will increase
    interoperability,

    decrease losses due to human errors, and provide seamless uniﬁcation of information.

    Vertical farming, which is the practice of growing crops in a vertically stacked
    layer within

    a controlled environment for maximum growth, is one way to grow crops independently

    of local soil and climate conditions [27].

    The widespread implementation of smart farming tools faces several limitations

    and challenges depending on the geographical location of the project. One prominent

    barrier is the lack of internet connectivity, especially in rural areas. Such
    technology is not

    affordable for everyone. Without a stable internet connection agricultural sensors
    cannot

    communicate with each other. The initial cost of installation is high for any
    SF project,

    making it especially difﬁcult for smallholder farms to accept the risks. Further,
    the farmers

    implementing smart farming technologies may not fully understand the operation,
    ﬁnd the

    system too complex to use, or may be skeptical about its beneﬁts. Older farmers
    usually

    prefer traditional farming and are unwilling to learn to operate new technology
    [28]. The

    security and privacy of the data generated by sensors is also a concern, as there
    has to be

    an accountable party in case of mishandling or misuse [6]. This review paper highlights

    the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs that are applicable to the agricultural
    sector. The

    practical implementation of these technologies in particular projects across the
    world has

    also been covered, along with the limitations of the approaches and their potential
    to

    alleviate signiﬁcant concerns faced by farmers. Exploratory sentiment analysis
    has also

    been performed on comments collected from YouTube videos relevant to smart farming

    in order to determine public opinion regarding the implementation of these tools.
    This

    work aims to serve as a reference and motivation for further research in the adoption
    of

    technological tools in the agricultural industry.

    2. Motivation

    In this study, an in-depth exploration of recent advancements in the ﬁeld of smart

    farming is performed. It has always been a human endeavor to revolutionize agriculture

    by domesticating animals, planting crops in rotations, using pesticides and fertilizers,
    etc.

    The advent of ICTs has brought about the fourth agricultural revolution, or Agriculture

    4.0, which focuses on the use of limited resources on targeted areas. As discussed
    in

    the previous section, this is achievable with the help of sophisticated technologies
    such

    as unmanned vehicles, satellite imagery, sensors, and more. DTs such as AI have
    also

    greatly impacted the agricultural sector by improving efﬁciency, providing predictive

    analysis of yield, and mitigating production and market risks. Studies have shown
    several

    beneﬁts of using smart solutions in farming practices, such as reduction of necessary

    manpower, increase in yield, effective management of livestock, monitoring of
    crops and

    weather conditions, predictive analysis, and cost reduction. Several initiatives
    have been

    undertaken across the world that support the use of precision farming and smart
    farming

    while also providing insight on the speciﬁc limitations that were encountered.
    It is crucial

    that the ever-increasing global food demand is met, as the survival of the human
    race

    depends on it. Smart farming is capable of providing essential assistance to farmers
    to

    ensure sustainable food production. It can help farmers manage risks by providing
    speciﬁc

    weather forecasts, yield projections, likelihood of diseases, and more. It can
    thereby also

    increase proﬁts for the farmer, as the availability of data on risk assessment
    and external

    conditions can allow for optimal cultivation of crops. The motivation for conducting
    this

    study is to streamline the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs applicable to
    the farming

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    427

    sector, analyze components of various smart farming projects, discuss potential
    uses of

    such components, and list the common challenges that face the large-scale adoption
    of such

    techniques. The considerations for using smart farming in different geographical
    regions

    also needs to be discussed. The general attitude of people towards the adoption
    of any

    new technology is a great indicator of its perceived beneﬁts. To determine the
    consensus of

    the opinion on smart farming, we have performed a surface-level sentiment analysis
    on

    comments collected from YouTube channels relevant to smart farming. Thus, this
    work can

    serve as a point of reference for future research in the area of smart farming
    and can help

    researchers explore diverse technologies that are relevant to the topic.

    During this exploratory study, we formed the following two hypotheses, each with

    their respective research questions for further investigation:

    Hypothesis 1. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications. The following research question was crafted
    to accept or

    reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Hypothesis 2. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.
    The following

    research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming
    tools?

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regards
    to smart

    farming?

    For this study, Google Scholar was used to perform exploratory analysis. Speciﬁc
    key-

    words, such as ‘plant disease detection’, ‘unmanned ground vehicles’, ‘precision
    livestock’,

    ‘big data’, etc., were selected. The searches were performed in the format [technology][smart

    farming]. For example, in order to search for articles that provided an overview
    of big-

    data applications in farming, the search phrase was ‘big data smart farming’.
    A total of

    30 keywords were grouped into six groups to analyze the number of citations for
    the top

    ﬁve results for each search. We attempted to exclude review papers that covered
    a few or

    all of the keywords. The number of citations for the top ﬁve results for each
    keyword is

    graphed in Figure 1 in six groups. The average number of citations for the top
    ﬁve results

    was calculated. The documents where the number of citations was greater than the
    average

    for that keyword were considered for the study.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 3 covers the various
    ICTs and

    DTs, such as big data, IoT, cloud computing, AI, unmanned vehicles, blockchain,
    and

    decision support systems, that enable smart farming initiatives. Research efforts
    and

    projects that utilize such technologies in the agricultural sector are also discussed.
    Section 4

    covers state-of-the-art smart farming projects that have been launched and completed
    in the

    European Union and across the world. A brief overview of user sentiment towards
    smart

    farming technologies is conducted through comments collected from YouTube videos
    about

    smart farming in Section 5, in order to better encapsulate user perception towards
    such

    tools. Section 6 highlights the various challenges present in the widespread adoption
    of

    precision and smart agricultural practices. In Section 7, we discuss the ﬁndings
    of our study

    with respect to the two hypotheses formulated, followed by the conclusion in Section
    8.

    3. Technologies

    This section provides a thorough discussion of the key technologies that assist
    in the

    evolution of smart farming. These technologies include sensing systems, wireless
    sensor

    networks, IoT, unmanned vehicles, decision support systems, blockchain, and more.
    One

    or more of these tools has been used in collaboration for smart farming projects
    worldwide.

    The development of new sensors with improved sensitivity has allowed for the collection

    of higher-quality spatial and temporal data, which can be be analyzed for more
    timely and

    efﬁcient decision making. The advancements in remote sensing translate to reducing
    human

    time and effort, as less human intervention is required. Over the past few years,
    UAVs

    and UGVs have drastically improved in precision and have become more lightweight
    and

    cheaper, allowing for their easy adaption on large-scale farms. Wireless sensor
    networks

    can help the seamless functioning of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and decision-support

    systems to impact production at all stages. IoT platforms can allow control of
    daily farm

    activities through remote devices. Figure 3 classiﬁes the technologies implemented
    in smart

    farming, along with their most common applications. Table 1 provides a brief description

    of each technology along with some related works and applications.

    3.1. Sensors

    The implementation of ICTs and DTs in farming is dependent on the availability
    of

    wireless connectivity. Remote sensing is crucial for IoT devices to function.
    Sensors serve

    as the basic building block in a wireless sensor network (WSN), which then handles
    the

    seamless communication between IoT devices. The advancements in sensing technology

    translate to the use of additional wavelengths in the light spectrum to remotely
    monitor

    crops, manage weeds, capture imagery, and more. Satellites and UAVs are equipped
    with

    thermal, visual light (RBG), and near infrared (NIR) cameras to capture multi
    or hyper-

    spectral images of the crop ﬁeld [24]. Hyper-spectral imaging divides light into
    thousands

    of smaller bands, which captures a lot of detail. Lightweight, hyper-spectral
    cameras can

    be used to monitor crop health, water and nutrient levels, and symptoms of a disease
    over

    large areas, which can be difﬁcult to access by other means. The availability
    of detailed and

    precise data also allows for spot application of resources and better decision
    making.

    The choice of technology to be used in a project relies heavily on the available
    band-

    width, transmission distance, and energy requirements. Wireless technologies that
    have

    been utilized in smart farming operations over the years include Bluetooth Low
    Energy

    (BLE), ZigBee, WiFi, 3G/4G/5G, LoRa, and more. Cellular networks (3G/4G/5G) serve

    the purpose of aggregating data from various sensors in a smart farming environment.

    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provides coverage of 100 m and consumes less power
    than

    Bluetooth. It can be implemented in systems for livestock positioning [52], greenhouse

    monitoring [30], and more. BLE is not suitable for transferring large amounts
    of data [53].

    ZigBee is a WSN protocol that provides a smaller coverage area and low energy
    con-

    sumption. It can be used for scenarios such as solar power monitoring [54], greenhouse

    monitoring, etc. WiFi is beneﬁcial where high bandwidth and large amounts of data
    trans-

    fer is required. Cellular 3G/4G/5G networks offer wide coverage and low latency,
    but

    they drive up the cost and power consumption. LoRa can cover an area of 20 km
    and

    consumes less energy. Specialized sensors have been introduced for tasks such
    as pest

    identiﬁcation and control, plant health monitoring, resource level monitoring,
    etc. Bug

    detection and classiﬁcation can be performed using acoustic sensing devices and
    cameras,

    which capture factors such ﬂight behavior and humming sound [55]. Similarly, parasite

    detection was performed in study [56] using a spectral sensor that measures light
    waves.

    The difference in the reﬂected light pattern can be an indicator of infestation
    in the plant.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    431

    López et al. [57] propose an autonomous monitoring system that uses a low-cost
    image

    sensor for visually inspecting bug traps deployed across the ﬁeld. Bioacoustic
    sensors

    have also been deployed to detect red palm weevil infestation in palm trees [58].
    Wireless

    sensors can be installed on leaves to monitor parameters such as humidity, water
    content,

    temperature, etc., to estimate the plant’s health and required amount of resources
    [59]. The

    growth rate of the plant stem and trunk can also be used to determine its health.
    Various

    sensors, such as the stem micro variation sensors, sap ﬂow relative rate sensors,
    stem ﬂux

    relative rate sensors, auxanometers, and trunk dendrometer, are used for this
    purpose [60].

    Environmental factors such as atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed,
    rainfall,

    temperature, and humidity can also be measured by wind speed and direction sensors,

    ambient seismic energy sensors, precipitation sensors, etc. [61]. Global navigation
    satellite

    systems (GNSS) can help increase efﬁciency in smart dairy farming. Smart collars
    can be

    worn by cows and can be used to collect data on the health and well-being of livestock
    [29].

    Farmers can program GPS collar trackers to keep cattle in a certain area. The
    cattle can then

    be sent to autonomous milking robots when their udders are full. The amount and
    quality

    of milk is then analyzed by the robots. Virtual fences can also prevent cattle
    from getting

    hurt on electric fencing and allow for rotational grazing [62].

    3.2. IoT Platforms

    IoT can enable devices and sensors to collect data about physical parameters of
    a

    farm. The functionalities provided by IoT, such as smart processing of data and
    real-time

    communication between devices, enable it to optimize agricultural practices [63].
    IoT

    blends the usage of physical devices such as actuators and sensors with a WSN
    to allow for

    seamless communication [26]. Sensors can serve as the peripheral devices that
    can gather

    information over a WSN which can then be analyzed with an IoT platform. There
    are

    currently several commercially available IoT platforms that aim to greatly reduce
    manual

    labor. They are utilized in various functions of crop monitoring. Zhang et al.
    [31] propose

    a monitoring system for wheat diseases, pests, and weed. The system collects data
    from

    IoT terminals and attempts real-time monitoring and management of crops. Lee et
    al. [64]

    implement a predictive system for effective pest control and proper utilization
    of pesticides

    and fungicides. Correlation is calculated between the pests and weather data relevant
    to

    the control of pests. Chieochan et al. [32] implement IoT sensors to monitor the
    humidity

    of a mushroom farm. The system controls sprinklers and fog pumps and provides
    push

    notiﬁcations to the user. Benaissa et al. [33] implement Wireless Body Area Networks

    (WBANs) in conjunction with IoT to monitor the health of dairy cows. Timely detection
    of

    health issues in the cattle is a costly and challenging task that was automated
    in the study

    through the use of a Long-Range (LoRa) off-body wireless channel and IoT. Garcia
    et al. [65]

    implement WSNs to monitor the presence of pests such as snails. The system is
    also capable

    of predictive analysis based on environmental factors such as temperature and
    humidity.

    Giri et al. [34] introduce an automation framework called AgriTech for adequate
    uti-

    lization of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. AgriTech allows the farmer to monitor
    the ﬁeld

    and perform actions such as spraying through the use of a mobile device. Kodali
    et al. [66]

    present the model of an IoT-based smart greenhouse that automatically carries
    out irri-

    gation, temperature and air humidity control, and water management with the help
    of

    sensors. In the study done by Na et al. [35], an IoT-based remote monitoring system
    is

    implemented to monitor soil characteristics such as pH, temperature, and moisture
    content

    using a DS18B20 sensor. Accurate measurement of such parameters can enable better

    analysis and decisions regarding fertilizer usage and crops sown. Kamilaris et
    al. [36]

    introduce Agri-IoT, a framework for analyzing real-time data streams from heterogeneous

    sensors that also supports decision making. It supports integration for data streams
    from

    multiple domains, data analytics, and interoperability for smart farming applications.

    Akkas et al. [37] implement a prototype of a wireless sensor network made up of
    MicaZ

    motes that monitor environmental variables such as temperature, light, pressure,
    and

    humidity in a greenhouse. The study highlights the advantages of implementing
    a WSN

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    432

    over traditional cabling within an IoT platform, such as costs, vulnerability,
    and inability to

    relocate the wiring system. Nayyar and Puri [67] propose the use of an IoT-based
    agricul-

    tural stick integrated with Arduino technology and Solar technology to capture
    live data

    on physical factors such as temperature and soil moisture. The system provided
    accuracy

    of 98% in live feeds when tested on live agricultural ﬁelds.

    3.3. Decision Support Systems (DSS)

    Decision support systems (DSSs) add value to the smooth functioning of farming

    practices by providing support to farmers, guiding them to correct information,
    assist-

    ing in decision making, and laying out the best course of action for a given scenario.

    The farm-wide availability of production rules and expertise can drastically improve
    efﬁ-

    ciency. Canadas et al. [38] propose a real-time decision support system implemented
    for

    greenhouse tomatoes that facilitates better decision making by identifying sensor
    faults,

    maintaining climate variables, and performing disease identiﬁcation on crops.
    The study

    highlights the effectiveness of the DSS in climate control and minimizing crop
    wastage

    due to diseases. Taylor et al. [68] perform a case study on web of things that
    highlights

    other useful applications of support systems such as environmental and livestock
    moni-

    toring. Dos Santons et al. [39] present AgriPrediction, an IoT-based support system
    that

    utilizes LoRa wireless network range system and the ARIMA predictive model to
    better

    manage crop dysfunctions. The system presents promising results, and is also shown
    to

    be applicable in rural areas with sparse connectivity. Kukar et al. [40] present
    AgroDSS,

    a novel cloud-based decision support system that allows farmers to perform predictive

    analysis on their own farm data. The system was implemented to study pest population

    and provide a better understanding of interdependencies of various parameters
    in a sim-

    ulated environment. The study done by Antonopoulou et al. [41] provides an approach

    for continued sustainability by allowing farmers to select alternate crops for
    a region. The

    system can be accessed through mobile devices to increase adoptability amongst
    farmers,

    and supports the farmer throughout the cultivation process. Thakare et al. [69]
    provide

    a DSS for remote monitoring that integrates smart sensing and smart irrigation
    systems

    to monitor parameters such as temperature, moisture content, and efﬁcient water
    use.

    The study emphasizes the importance of smart farming with hydroponics, which allows

    farming in unsuitable soil and water conditions.

    3.4. Unmanned Vehicles

    The advancement in robotics has led to the development of autonomous vehicles,

    which are used extensively in farming for mechanical weeding, fertilizer spraying,
    and

    harvesting. Unmanned vehicles have shown to decrease human labor, improve productiv-

    ity, reduce costs, and increase accuracy of measurements. They could be further
    classiﬁed

    into UAVs and UGVs. UAVs are aircraft embedded with wireless sensors, transmitters,

    and/or cameras that can function autonomously or be controlled remotely. UGVs,
    on

    the other hand, are autonomous machines that operate while in contact with the
    ground.

    The use of lightweight cameras with autonomous aerial vehicles can allow for remote

    monitoring of crops, which can allow for better decision making. Bareth et al.
    [70] per-

    formed a study to examine the usability of UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface
    models

    for estimating plant height, estimating the biomass through height measurement,
    and

    combining vegetation indices for more accurate estimation. The results obtained
    from

    ﬁeld experiments imply that UAV-based RGB imaging can provide accurate modeling
    of

    physical parameters of the plant. The review study done by Roldan et al. [71]
    highlights

    the advancement of robots in smart farming for automation of labor-intensive tasks
    such as

    planting, harvesting, monitoring, inspection, and treating crops. Unmanned vehicles
    are

    able to collect information about the environment and navigate it by using machine
    vision

    systems. They implement Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies
    [72] to

    navigate precisely. UAVs provide an added advantage for remote sensing in the
    form of

    timely control and high spatial ground resolution. Remote imaging can capture
    several

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    433

    characteristics through different types of cameras, such as multispectral, thermal,
    and high

    spatial resolution RGB camera, as demonstrated in the study done by Matese et
    al. [73] to

    measure intra-vineyard variability and leaf temperature and to perform analysis
    of missing

    plants. UAVs possess the potential to obtain high spatial resolution imagery without
    being

    too affected by weather conditions.

    Lu et al. [74] perform species classiﬁcation in tall grassland with the use of
    high spatial

    resolution imagery obtained from a UAV, and show that the method obtains higher
    accuracy

    than other data from satellites. Tripicchio et al. [75] present a novel implementation
    of an

    RGB-D sensor integrated with UAVs to differentiate between different plowing techniques

    used on a ﬁeld. The system provides the functionality of computer vision, navigation,

    and data analysis and was shown to be a feasible technique for determination of
    soil

    characteristics. Moribe et al. [76] provide an effective and synchronized technique
    for

    measuring leaf temperature. Infrared thermometers attached to drones and sensor
    nodes

    integrate seamlessly with the WSN. Lottes et al. [77] propose a system that utilizes
    a UAV

    to detect vegetation, such as sugar beets, and performs feature extraction and
    maps the

    distribution of weeds and crops. UAVs provide an autonomous solution for monitoring

    large areas of agricultural land covering crops, livestock, and more. Unmanned
    vehicles

    function through the use of technologies such as robotics, IoT, remote sensing,
    and big

    data, and can automate labor-intensive tasks such as spraying, data collection,
    water

    management, weed mapping, irrigation, fertilization, crop monitoring and management,

    and ﬁeld-level phenotyping.

    3.5. Cloud/Edge Computing

    Given the vast amount of incoming data from various sources, a centralized approach

    to storing and managing large amounts of data is essential. A cloud-based architecture

    can allow for the necessary computation power to analyze the plethora of data
    obtained

    from the different types of sensors installed on a farm. Cloud computing facilitates
    ﬂexible

    storage and availability of data and resources, making them suitable for real-time
    implemen-

    tation. Rupanagudi et al. [42] propose a novel solution to pest control in tomatoes
    by crop

    monitoring using video processing, cloud computing, and robotics. Zhou et al.
    [43] present

    a cloud-computing-enabled spatio–temporal cyber–physical infrastructure (CESCI)
    to per-

    form comprehensive surface soil moisture monitoring, which can help reduce costs,
    increase

    agricultural productivity, and boost farmers’ net income. FIWARE is an open-sourced
    cloud

    platform that has shown potential in many smart farming applications. Kaloxylos
    et al. [44]

    present a cloud-based farm management system that utilizes the FIWARE architecture
    and

    was shown to be acceptable by farmers during evaluation. Corista et al. [45] introduce

    an IoT-based smart farming system built upon FIWARE that aims to control fruit
    quality

    during the entire fruit production chain. The system is developed using the vf-OS
    (virtual

    factory Operating System) platform, which integrates various applications and
    allows

    external producers and consumers to interact.

    Another IoT platform based on cloud and edge computing is proposed by

    Zamora et al. [46] and works in three tiers: the local plane collects data on
    crops, the

    edge plane monitors and manages the main precision agriculture (PA) tasks, and
    the cloud

    platform maintains records and performs data analytics. Fog computing, also called
    edge

    computing, is a decentralized computing architecture between the cloud and connected
    pe-

    ripheral devices and aims to enhance speed and performance [78]. Edge computing
    systems

    provide a decentralized approach to automation of tasks by using pre-loaded ﬁeld
    data

    from edge locations [79]. Thus, fog computing is a promising architecture for
    smart farming

    solutions, since it provides low latency and increased reliability for support
    systems [80].

    In case of real-time operational decision making, time is of the essence. Malik
    et al. [47]

    introduce a simulation platform that leverages fog computing to allow users to
    under-

    stand sensor deployment and data collection in a complete farming ecosystem. Thus,

    a cloud platform is essential if real-time analysis is to be performed. Use of
    additional

    data-driven approaches can be invaluable depending on the application. Cloud computing

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    434

    architecture can be used to manipulate large amounts of heterogeneous data arising
    from

    several sources. It can provide the necessary storage and computation resources,
    making it

    complementary to big data tools.

    3.6. Blockchain

    Blockchain technology provides new modes of interaction between parties in a supply

    chain. It is a distributed, immutable ledger that keeps a record of all transactions
    of digital

    assets over a network. It also has the capacity to improve food safety by providing
    traceabil-

    ity for purchased food products and monitoring for contamination. In order to
    avoid bias in

    the data collected from ICT and DT devices, it is important that data manipulation
    is made

    difﬁcult or impossible. The addition of a new record in a blockchain requires
    veriﬁcation

    from a peer-to-peer network, ensuring its legitimacy. Similarly, the majority
    should agree

    while making changes to records, making it difﬁcult for unauthorized individuals
    to alter

    the data. Thus, blockchain-based technologies for smart farming ensure that the
    data is

    correct, transparent, and traceable. In conjunction with smart contracts, which
    are protocols

    that are activated without human intervention when the terms of an agreement are
    met,

    blockchain technology can ensure timely payments [81]. Vangala et al. [48] propose
    an

    authenticated key agreement mechanism for smart farming that is based on smart
    contracts.

    The system is shown to provide more security and functionality than other authentication

    protocols. Patil et al. [50] present a security framework that combines blockchain
    technol-

    ogy with IoT devices and allows sharing of a digital ledger of transactions among
    the nodes

    on an IoT network. Lin et al. [51] introduce an ecological food traceability system
    that

    incorporates blockchain technology and IoT and aims to improve food safety while
    also

    establishing trust between the parties involved. The use of smart contracts is
    also consid-

    ered for the timely management of problems in the system. An ICT and DT e-agricultural

    system with blockchain technology that distributes water quality data over a network

    is proposed by Lin et al. [49]. They also present an evaluation tool that can
    be used to

    determine the speciﬁc requirements and suitability of this technology. A simulated
    model

    of blockchain technology is proposed by Widi Widayat et al. [82] and can be implemented

    in a smart farming environment. The parties in a smart farming system, namely
    farmers,

    food suppliers, and customers, are connected to a global blockchain network and
    appear

    as a node account in the smart contract. Another potential application of blockchain
    tech-

    nology is for providing agricultural insurance. Nguyen et al. [83] present a smart
    contract

    developed on NEO to provide drought-based crop insurance. This could be invaluable

    to farmers who work in extreme weather conditions, as it can reduce their damages
    and

    vulnerability while also avoiding excess evaluation costs.

    3.7. Big Data and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    IoT devices and sensors capture various types of data from all over the ﬁeld that
    can

    then be analyzed through big data tools. Big data refers to larger and more complex
    datasets

    that consist of a greater variety of data from multiple data sources and can also
    be mined

    for opinions and information [84]. Data modeling techniques such as machine learning
    and

    deep learning can help enhance the entire food production cycle by performing
    predictive

    analysis, providing real-time decision making, and reﬁning the business model
    of the farm

    to cut loses. AI is a research sub-ﬁeld of computer science that utilizes robust
    datasets to

    solve problems by performing classiﬁcation or predictions based on the input data
    [85].

    Machine learning is a sub-ﬁeld of AI that allows models to learn from experience
    without

    being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a sub-ﬁeld of machine learning that
    further

    eliminates some of the human intervention required in training by automating feature

    extraction from larger datasets [86]. Currently, there are also several types
    of state-of-the-

    art conversational systems being used to assist farmers in agricultural operations
    [87].

    Table 2 summarizes some notable research works in smart farming that have performed

    image processing using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a class
    of

    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) that are used to perform classiﬁcation tasks
    on images

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    435

    by adjusting learnable weights and biases [88]. Table 3 provides a summary of
    various

    studies that have utilized other AI models in smart farming, along with their
    respective

    outcomes.

    AI can help reduce resource wastage through monitoring and predictive modeling.

    Varghese and Sharma [89] propose a hardware-based system that helps monitor factors

    such as moisture content in soil, humidity, and atmospheric conditions. The system
    also

    determines the appropriate crops for given soil and environmental conditions through
    the

    use of IoT and machine learning. Arvindan et al. [90] introduce an automated irrigation

    system that measures moisture content in the soil and provides remote control
    through

    an Android smart phone. This can help with the sustainable and automatic farming
    of

    certain crops that require different degrees of irrigation depending on their
    growth stage.

    Khaki et al. [91] introduce WheatNet, which is a CNN that collects ﬁeld observational
    data,

    such as wheat head counts. The system achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
    Root

    Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.85 and 5.19, respectively, in the wheat head counting
    task

    with fewer parameters, implying that the approach is robust and crucial for observation
    and

    decision making. Deep learning algorithms are used extensively to reduce crop
    wastage

    and optimize crop yield. The development of systems for accurate prediction of
    crop yield

    is essential, especially in developing countries, as it can secure food availability,
    prevent

    famine, and provide further assistance to the sustainable development of agriculture.
    Crop

    yield can depend on several factors, such as genotype, environment, etc. Wang
    et al. [12]

    present a deep-learning-based system for predicting soybean crop yields based
    on data

    collected from remote sensing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells were trained
    and

    tested on 4 years of Argentinian soybean harvest data. The model’s transferability
    was

    then tested by using soybean harvest results from Brazil. Khaki et al. [13] implemented

    Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for yield prediction of maize. The dataset consisted
    of

    the genotype and yield performance of 2267 maize hybrids. The best-performing
    model

    provided an RMSE of 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation
    for the

    validation dataset in imperfect weather conditions.

    Alfred et al. [92] provide a survey of the implementation of big data and machine
    learn-

    ing on paddy rice production in the Asia–Pacific region. The integration of sensors,
    satellites,

    and drones complements machine learning tools in improving productivity. Machine
    learn-

    ing tools utilize the big data collected from these devices for estimating rice
    yield [93,94],

    monitoring growth [94], and providing a smart irrigation system [95]. Kiruthika
    et al. [96]

    propose a system to detect paddy rice crop diseases such as leaf blast disease,
    brown spot

    disease, and bacterial blight disease. A Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
    is used to

    recognize disease from the input image; two classifiers are used for recognition:
    ANN and

    Support Vector Machine (SVM). ANN performs better than SVM, with a precision of
    90.60%

    and accuracy of an 93.33%. Dahane et al. [97] propose a novel EDGE–fog–IoT–cloud-based

    architecture that utilizes WSNs to support farming activities in three steps:
    data collection

    from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water level, etc.), data cleaning
    and

    storage, and predictive analysis through AI tools. Performance of Gated Recurrent
    Unit

    (GRU) and LSTMs on live data from three parameters is compared, with varying results.

    Jhuria et al. [9] propose a tool that utilizes ANNs to identify diseases in grapes
    and apples.

    Image processing is performed on an image dataset, and an accuracy of 90% is obtained
    based

    on color and texture. The study also provides a tool to determine the quality
    of fruit by

    weight. Bhange et al. [98] present a web-based tool for identification of fruit
    diseases trained

    on images of pomegranate fruit. The system processes an image uploaded by the
    user for

    parameters such as color and morphology, and classifies it as infected or non-infected
    using

    SVMs. Accuracy of 82% was recorded using the ‘morphology’ parameter in the experiment.

    Guo et al. [10] propose a system for identification of plant diseases through
    the use of deep

    learning. The model identifies black rot, bacterial plaque and rust diseases by
    implementing

    a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for leaf localization, the Chan–Vese algorithm
    for leaf

    segmentation, and VGG-13 [99] architecture for disease identification. This method
    provides

    an accuracy of 83.57%. In the study by Ferentinos [100], image classification
    through a VGG

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    436

    CNN is performed on a database of 87,848 photographs of leaves of healthy and
    infected

    plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, and a
    success rate of

    99.53% is achieved. Similarly, smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis is performed
    by

    Mohanty et al. [101] on the PlantVillage dataset consisting of 54,306 images of
    plant leaves.

    The GoogleNet architecture performed the best out of all models tested, resulting
    in an

    accuracy of 99.35% on 14 crop species and 26 diseases. The prevention of fruit
    tree diseases

    can also significantly impact overall agricultural production. Li et al. [102]
    conducted a study

    comparing the performance of three ensemble learning classifiers and two deep
    learning

    classifiers. The stacking ensemble learning classifier provides the highest validation
    accuracy

    of 98.05% and test accuracy of 97.34% on a dataset of 10,000 images of pear black
    spot, pear

    rust, apple mosaic, and apple rust. Figure 4 displays a generalized example of
    plant disease

    identification through the use of CNNs. The network takes input in the form of
    segmented

    images and classifies them as ‘Diseased’ and ‘Not Diseased’.

    Figure 4. Disease identiﬁcation through image processing.

    Due to the rapid increase in global meat consumption, technologies such as precision

    livestock farming [103] have become essential to ensure the quality of meat products
    and

    reduction of the environmental impact. AI tools can also prove beneﬁcial in livestock

    management by monitoring cattle health and behavior. Xu et al. [104] propose a
    system for

    individual identiﬁcation of cattle through face detection, performed using the
    RetinaNet

    object detection algorithm. Fine-tuning was performed on seven different CNN models,

    and transfer learning was used for this study. RetinaNet incorporating the ResNet
    50

    provided the highest average accuracy of 99.8% and an average processing time
    of 0.0438 s.

    Gjergji et al. [105] evaluated the following neural networks for the regression
    task of cattle

    weight prediction: CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)/CNN networks, recurrent

    attention models, and recurrent attention models with CNNs. CNNs were shown to

    provide the best performance with MAE of 23.19 kg, signiﬁcantly outperforming
    the top

    linear regression models, which reached an error of 38.46 kg. Jung et al. [106]
    present a

    deep learning-based system for classiﬁcation of cattle vocals and real-time monitoring
    of

    livestock. The voice parameter of cattle can signal valuable information such
    as gender

    of cattle, distress, and disorders in the cattle [107]. The voice was converted
    to Mel-

    frequency cepstral coefﬁcients (MFCCs) and given as input to a CNN for classiﬁcation

    with an accuracy of 91.36%. The accuracy increased to 94.18% when short-time Fourier

    transform-based noise ﬁltering was used to reduce background noise. In the context
    of

    smart farming practices, deep learning has also been shown to be widely beneﬁcial
    in

    the ﬁeld of aquaculture. Fish production contributes to a great portion of the
    food source

    in any area. Zhang et al. [108] propose the use of DNNs for ﬁsh identiﬁcation,
    species

    classiﬁcation, analysis of ﬁsh behavior, feeding decisions, and water quality
    prediction. The

    method provided an accuracy of 96% and recognition rate of 98% when trained on
    the Fish 4

    knowledge dataset, which contains 8487 images of ﬁsh with different conditions.
    The study

    done by Rohani et al. [109] proposes a model consisting of multi-layer perceptron
    (MLP)

    and SVM for classiﬁcation of rainbow trout as dead or alive. Both classiﬁers provided

    an average accuracy of 100% during the training phase and average of 99.45% during

    the testing phase. Zambrano et al. [110] propose the use of machine learning tools
    to

    forecast water quality variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and pond temperature.
    A

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    437

    comparison is performed between Random Forests (RF), ANNs, and multivariate linear

    regression, out of which RFs performed the best.

    CNNs can also be used to perform object detection and pattern recognition on images

    collected by aerial vehicles to detect anomalies such as weed clusters, standing
    water, etc.

    Chiu et al. [111] introduce ‘Agriculture-Vision’, a large-scale dataset of aerial
    farmland

    images, designed for semantic segmentation of agricultural pattern recognition.
    The dataset

    consists of 94,986 high-quality aerial images consisting of RGB and near-infrared
    (NIR)

    channels. The study proposed a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-based model with
    a

    ResNet encoder to classify 9 ﬁeld anomaly patterns. The mean intersection-over-union

    (mIoU) was 43.40% for the validation set and 43.66% for the test set. The ﬁrst
    Agriculture-

    Vision Challenge [112] encouraged further development of novel algorithms for
    pattern

    recognition in agriculture. The challenge dataset consists of 21,061 aerial and
    multi-spectral

    farmland images, and six anomaly patterns were to be recognized in the task. The
    best-

    performing model, Residual DenseNet with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, introduced

    by Team DSCC, achieved a modiﬁed mIoU of 63.9%. The study by Kussul et al. [113]

    performs classiﬁcation of crops using MLPs, RFs, and CNNs. The dataset consisted
    of

    19 multitemporal scenes acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A RS satellites, and
    the

    highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 94.6% was achieved by 2-D CNNs. Another crop
    vision

    dataset for species classiﬁcation and detection is the CropDeep [114] dataset,
    which consists

    of 31,147 images and at least 1500 samples for each of the 30 classes. A baseline
    study

    showed the best performing model was ResNet50, with an accuracy of 99.81%. The
    study

    further suggests the YOLOv3 network with modiﬁcation to achieve higher accuracy
    on

    the dataset. Anand et al. [115] present ‘AgriSegNet’, which is a multi-scale hierarchical

    attention network for semantic segmentation using UAV-acquired aerial images for
    IoT-

    assisted precision agriculture. The mIoU on the test set of the Agriculture-Vision
    dataset

    for the six anomaly classes are: Background: 78.10%; Double Plant: 46.40%; Planter
    Skip:

    8.60%; Standing Water: 61.20%; Waterway: 44.90%; Weed Cluster: 50.20%.

    In this subsection, we emphasize several points regarding the opportunities provided

    by AI in the ﬁeld of smart farming. Image processing is of great importance to
    the agricul-

    tural sector. Images captured by UAVs, UGVs, satellites, and sensors need to be
    analyzed so

    that relevant insight can be extracted from them to assist in farm operations.
    Depending on

    the requirements, different types of cameras, such as visible spectrum, NIR, hyperspectral,

    or multispectral may be used. In conjunction with several ICTs, AI can efﬁciently
    perform

    functions such as crop monitoring, livestock monitoring, disease detection, pest
    detection,

    etc. Predictive modeling can help farmers to prepare for extreme weather conditions
    and

    market ﬂuctuations, thereby lowering their vulnerability. Current state-of-the-art
    models

    have provided promising results, implying that further research in the area with
    more

    advanced AI tools can help to bridge the gap in food production.

    4. Initiatives Worldwide

    This section includes the various research initiatives that have been undertaken
    in

    smart farming in the European Union [119] and across the world. The initiatives
    usually

    employ several of the ICTs and DTs discussed in Section 3. The European Union
    has

    funded many projects to allow for the integration of ICTs and DTs into the agricultural

    sector. Crop monitoring is one of the major functions performed in farms that
    utilize

    smart farming tools. Table 4 provides an overview of the recent projects concerning
    the

    implementation of SF tools for crop monitoring that have been undertaken in the
    European

    Union. Table 5 lists the projects that perform other functions such as harvesting,
    water

    management, satellite imagery, and more. The corresponding technologies for each
    project

    have also been listed along with their application. The Echord++ [120] project,
    which

    lasted from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2018, involved various ﬁeld operations
    such as

    monitoring, harvesting, and grafting for crops such as tomatoes, asparagus, and
    peppers.

    Cloud computing is utilized by many projects that require monitoring operations.
    These

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    439

    include Vinbot [121] (crop monitoring and yield prediction in a vineyard), Ermes
    [122] (crop

    monitoring for rice), Fractals [123] (monitoring, disease detection, and fertilization
    of olive

    trees), and more. The importance of UAVs and UGVs is apparent, as they have been
    utilized

    in several projects. Implementations of UGVs include Vinerobot [124] for a vineyard,

    Sweeper [125] for harvesting peppers, Flourish [126] for monitoring and spraying
    sugar

    beets and sunﬂowers, PANtHEOn [127] for monitoring hazelnuts and water management,

    and Romi [128] for crop monitoring and weed management. UAVs are utilized for
    crop

    monitoring of rice in Ermes [122], potatoes and vineyard in Mistrale [129], and
    more.

    Seamless communication between different technologies has been executed through
    the use

    of WSNs, such as Water-Bee [130] and Figaro [131], for the purpose of water management.

    There have been several research projects on smart farming taken up all over the

    world, in part inspired by the positive outcomes of the EU projects. Table 6 provides
    a

    summary of government projects and start-ups that focus on the development of
    innovative

    solutions for smart farming. Some projects, such as the Villages of Excellence
    (VoE),

    have been launched in collaboration between two governments to ensure the sharing
    of

    technology and expertise and provide better outcomes for both. Smart irrigation
    plays

    an important role in ensuring crop sustainability in dry areas. Startups such
    as Madar

    Farms [141] and Responsive drip irrigation [142] aim to provide smart irrigation
    solutions

    to tackle water challenges and food security in the United Arab Emirates and the
    United

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    440

    States respectively. SunCulture [143] is a Kenyan AgriTech company that provides
    solar-

    powered irrigation systems for smallholder farms, and also provides the option
    of a drip

    irrigation system. In Morocco, the government introduced the Green Generation
    2020–2030

    strategy [144], which focuses on the digitization of agriculture through initiatives
    such as

    the installation of solar pumps for irrigation. Food security and sustainability
    are of great

    concern worldwide. Startups such as AbyFarm [145] in Singapore aim to implement
    urban

    farming by employing ICT and DT tools such as IoT and blockchain. Lack of resources

    in rural areas could be a hindering factor in crop yield. Ossian Agro Automation
    [146] is

    an Indian company working towards rural automation and the development of wireless

    automation systems. All year round production of crops can be achieved by vertical

    farming, which is the practice of growing crops in many layers in a controlled
    environment.

    Ground vertical farming [147] in Lebanon implements vertical farming and aims
    to reduce

    water wastage by re-circulation. Figure 5 displays the various smart farming projects
    taken

    up across the world, classiﬁed according to their primary function.

    Figure 5. Smart Farming initiatives worldwide

    In several developing countries, there is a lack of government-funded projects.
    The

    initiative is rather taken up by individual startups, with the goal to provide
    assistance to

    farmers, conduct further research, and educate farmers and learners about the
    potential

    of agricultural technology. There is an increased interest amongst consumers,
    who want

    to ensure that the end product they receive is unadulterated. Public opinion in
    Europe

    skews in favor of healthy products grown with minimum pesticides. Consideration
    of the

    socio–economic impact of smart farming projects is also necessary. Certain participating

    farms have reported average cost savings of over €5000 and reduction of climate
    impact by

    10% [148]. Thus, these initiatives have been greatly beneﬁcial to farming operations
    by de-

    creasing costs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and improving soil conditions.
    The projects

    contributed signiﬁcantly to their objectives of reducing resource wastage, environmental

    impact, and energy consumption, and demonstrated measures to mitigate issues resulting

    from climate change and the shortage of skilled labor.

    5. Sentiment Analysis

    In order to ensure successful integration of new tools and technologies available
    for

    smart farming, it is necessary to understand how knowledgeable the general public
    is

    about the topics and how the innovations are perceived. Public sentiment can be
    a strong

    determinant of whether or not a project is approved for implementation in an area
    [166].

    It can also be indicative of the various socio–economic, behavioral, and cultural
    issues

    that arise by the advancement and implementation of such technology [28,167].
    In light of

    this, we performed sentiment analysis on the comments of YouTube videos pertaining
    to

    smart farming technologies. This section provides details about the dataset, experimental

    methodology, and the results and analysis of the experiment.

    5.1. Dataset

    The dataset was constructed by scraping YouTube comments left by users on 16 YouTube

    videos that were relevant to our study [168–172]. The videos were selected by
    searching

    the relevant keywords, such as ‘smart farming IoT’, and then ﬁltering the ones
    with most

    views and comments. Table 7 provides a list of the video titles, the channels,
    upload date,

    and the total number of likes and views on each video. For this study, only comments

    in English were considered. A total of 7311 comments were included in the dataset
    from

    videos about smart farming.

    5.2. Experiment

    Two approaches were used for performing sentiment analysis. In the first approach,
    two

    annotators assigned one of the following six labels to the comments: ‘Praising’,
    ‘Queries’,

    ‘Suggestions’, ‘Undefined’, ‘Hybrid’, and ‘Opinion’. Cohen’s kappa coefficient,
    which is a

    measure of inter-rater agreement, was calculated on the ratings of the two annotators.
    The

    value of the kappa statistic ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 implying only a chance
    agreement and 1

    implying perfect agreement between the two annotators. The formula to calculate
    Cohen’s

    kappa for two raters is:

    κ = po − pe

    1 − pe

    = 1 − 1 − po

    1 − pe

    (1)

    where: po = the relative observed agreement among raters, and pe = the hypothetical

    probability of chance agreement.

    A brief description of these labels is given in Table 8, along with the total
    number of

    comments for each label, and an example of the label from the dataset. Table 9
    gives the total

    counts of each of the six labels that were assigned to the comments collected
    from the videos.

    The second approach was to apply transfer learning to perform surface level sentiment

    analysis using the pre-trained Pattern library for Python. Pattern library can
    be used to

    perform various natural language processing tasks such as parsing, N-gram generation,

    and more. Polarity of a given text ranges from 1 to −1, with 1 representing a
    highly positive

    sentiment and −1 representing a highly negative sentiment. The subjectivity ranges
    from

    0 (Objective) to 1 (Subjective). It provides a measure of factual information
    or personal

    opinion in the comments, with 1 being subjective and 0 being objective. For example,
    for

    the following comment in our dataset: ’Fantastic. We need a lot of that here in
    Australia;

    suffering from drought; really bad water management by those in authority etc.’
    , the

    polarity was calculated as −0.1499 and subjectivity was 0.7833. The negative value
    of

    polarity indicates that the sentiment expressed by the comment was negative, whereas
    the

    value of subjectivity is closer to 1 suggesting that the comment was mostly subjective.

    5.3. Results and Analysis

    In this section, we detail the results of our experiment and analyze our ﬁndings.

    Evaluation has been conducted separately for the two approaches through user-based

    analysis and transfer-learning-based analysis. Table 10 records the number of
    comments

    under a video and the results obtained from sentiment analysis. The value of mean
    polarity,

    mean subjectivity, and Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient is listed for each corresponding
    video

    serial number.

    5.3.1. User-Based Analysis

    In user-based analysis, the mean Cohen’s kappa was calculated to be 0.9617, which

    shows high inter-rater reliability. Figure 6 displays the Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    for each

    video with respect to the mean value. The value is highest at 1 for videos no.
    5, 9, and 12,

    indicating perfect agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The
    value

    is lowest at 0.8141 for video no. 2 titled ‘Europe has the best regenerative farmers
    in the

    world’, implying a slight disagreement between the assigned labels. The high value
    of

    kappa coefﬁcient implies that the categories assigned by the annotators are correct.

    Figure 7 plots the correlation matrix between the frequency of the six labels.
    We can

    see the highest degree of correlation is 0.96 between the following labels: ‘Opinion’
    and

    ‘Suggestion’, and ‘Queries’ and ‘Hybrid’, indicating that the frequency of one
    increases

    with the other. The lowest degree of correlation is 0.81 between ‘Hybrid’ and
    ‘Undeﬁned’,

    suggesting that all labels show a relatively positive correlation amongst each
    other.

    A word cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data
    where

    the frequency or importance of each word is indicated by its size. It can help
    us highlight

    and analyze signiﬁcant textual data points. Pre-processing of the comments was
    performed

    to remove stop words and punctuation from the text. Figure 8 displays the word
    clouds

    for the comments collected from videos of serial number 1–8. We can see that on
    the word

    cloud in Figure 8a, which is for the video titled ‘How Japan Is Reshaping Its
    Agriculture By

    Harnessing Smart- Farming Technology’, ‘Japan’ is one of the most frequent and
    important

    words in the text. Similarly, for Figure 8g for video no. 7 on the bottom left
    titled ‘7 Israeli

    Agriculture Technologies’, the most signiﬁcant word is ‘Israel’. Figure 9 displays
    the word

    clouds for the comments collected from videos of serial number 9–16. The word
    9b on the

    top left for the video titled ‘Singapore’s Bold Plan to Build the Farms of the
    Future’ has

    ‘Singapore’ as the most prominent word. This indicates that several comments for
    these

    videos included some text about the country in which the technology was implemented.
    For

    videos demonstrating a particular technology, such as No. 7: ‘Solar Panels Plus
    Farming?

    Agrivoltaics Explained’; No. 8: ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept
    (Full

    Version)’; and No. 14: ‘RIPPA The Farm Robot Exterminates Pests And Weeds’, the
    name of

    the technology (solar, tractor, robot, respectively) is of great prominence. Table
    11 provides

    a list of the top ﬁve most-relevant words in the comments dataset for each video,
    along

    with their respective frequencies.

    5.3.2. Transfer-Learning-Based Analysis

    The results of sentiment analysis using the Pattern library are discussed in this
    sub-

    section. Mean polarity and mean subjectivity are plotted opposite each other in
    Figure 10.

    The overall polarity for all 7311 comments is 0.2092, suggesting that the overall
    sentiment

    is slightly positive. The overall subjectivity of all comments is 0.4352, implying
    that the

    comments were close to being neutral. Subjective statements generally contain
    personal

    opinion, emotion, or judgment, whereas objective comments are factual information.
    Po-

    larity determines the degree of positive or negative sentiment in the text. The
    highest

    mean subjectivity score was 0.5480 for video no. 13 titled ‘Simply Fresh—India’s
    Largest

    State Of The Art Precision Farm’, followed by 0.5369 for video no. 11 titled ‘Smart
    Vertical

    Farms in Sharjah’. This shows that the comments were of a more opinionated nature,
    rather

    than being factual. The lowest mean subjectivity score was 0.2915 for video no.
    9 titled

    ‘IOT Smart Plant Monitoring System’, indicating that mostly facts were discussed
    in the

    comments for this video. The score suggesting higher objectivity could be because
    the video

    is discussing technical details about an IoT platform rather than explaining widespread

    innovative concepts such as precision farms and vertical farms. The comments collected

    from video no. 8 titled ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept (Full Version)’

    resulted in the lowest mean polarity of 0.0919, indicating that the user sentiment
    was

    generally neutral. The highest mean polarity of 0.4460 was achieved for video
    no. 13 titled

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    447

    ‘Simply Fresh—India’s Largest State Of The Art Precision Farm’, showing that user
    attitude

    was generally positive towards the state-of-the-art precision farm highlighted
    in the video.

    Figure 8. Word clouds for videos serial no. 1–8 corresponding (a–h) respectively.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    448

    Figure 9. Word clouds for videos no. 9–16 corresponding (a–h) respectively.

    In the investigation of user sentiment towards smart farming and precision agriculture,

    the main objective was to analyze user opinion, which is the voice of masses.
    During

    compilation of the dataset, it was observed that videos providing more in-depth
    and

    case-study-based information about smart farming tools did not receive many views
    and

    comments. This could be because the general public is not well-informed about
    novel

    technology in the farming sector, as asserted in Section 6. The majority of the
    comments

    were collected from videos about broader topics. The Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    indicated

    that the labels assigned by the two annotators were mostly in agreement and valid.
    The

    mean values of polarity and subjectivity in the comments was calculated through
    the

    Pattern library, and the results suggest that there is a varying degree of subjectivity
    amongst

    the comments. The polarity suggests that user opinion was mostly positive in the
    comments

    analyzed. Thus, it can be safely inferred that training and education programs
    can increase

    the visibility of innovations in smart farming, allowing the general population
    to form a

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    449

    well-informed opinion on the risks and beneﬁts. Positive user sentiment can then
    serve as

    a catalyst towards faster adoption of such tools.

    6. Challenges

    There has been a signiﬁcant increase in the number of smart farming initiatives
    being

    taken up around the world, with promising results. However, with the advent of
    new,

    innovative technologies there are always some unseen risks and associated challenges.

    The agricultural sector has greatly impacted the environment by taking up about
    40% of

    the world’s available land [173] and consuming approximately 70% of the water
    [174].

    Climate change and the growing population further exacerbate food and water scarcity,

    making sustainable food production a challenging task. Thus, it is critical that
    current

    agricultural practices need to evolve to ensure the efﬁcient use of land and water
    resources.

    To elaborate further on Research Question 2, we discuss the various challenges
    that hamper

    the adoption of smart farming in the following bullet points:

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    450

    1.

    Training and awareness: Lack of technical expertise by the farmers implementing

    new technology is a major setback to smart farming. Das et al. [28] conducted
    a

    study to understand the views of Irish farmers towards adoption of cloud computing

    and smart farming technologies. Surveys and interviews conducted with 32 farmers

    revealed that the rate of adoption was higher among younger farmers and lower

    amongst older farmers, who were hesitant to use new technology and preferred

    traditional farming. The digital divide has to be reduced by providing guidance

    and training to the farmers [175]. Lack of knowledge about the technology results

    in greater skepticism towards its adoption amongst farmers, who may not realize

    the value of the tool or consider it an unsuitable ﬁt for their farm. In this
    current

    study, we formed a dataset of YouTube comments related to smart farming operations

    and performed surface level sentiment analysis of them. During the data collection

    process, it was observed that very few comments were left under videos that provided

    a technical and detailed framework for a smart farming project. Comments were

    mostly collected from videos explaining broader topics, such as ‘Vertical Farming’.

    This indicates that there is a general lack of awareness about these technologies
    and

    their applicability to farming.

    2.

    Technical considerations: Fixed and moving sensing technologies require further

    improvements to be able to withstand extreme weather conditions in order to remain

    fully functional [176,177]. Edge node devices may be battery dependent and run
    out

    of power during operation [178,179]. Data is collected from various sensors and
    can be

    analyzed through IoT platforms. There is a requirement for data storage, as there
    is a

    huge amount of data being generated from IoT devices. IoT has improved connectivity

    of all operations by leaps and bounds, but it does come with the added concern
    of

    data privacy and security [180]. It also exposes the smart farming environment
    to

    cybersecurity threats, which could result in signiﬁcant loses [181]. Data encrypting

    in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) also presents a signiﬁcant challenge
    for

    farmers [182].

    3.

    Costs: The costs associated with sensors needs to reduced so that they can be
    imple-

    mented in small-scale farms as well. The solution needs to be designed speciﬁcally

    for the project in question, and also needs regular updates and management. Farmers

    may hesitate in implementing such technologies as they could create issues and
    cause

    further losses instead of providing beneﬁts. Research and development costs for
    the

    implementation of such tools are also steep. There is also a signiﬁcant amount
    of cost

    associated with data transmission within a smart farm [183]. Market uncertainty
    adds

    substantial risk to ensuring a sustainable income for farmers, as proﬁt margins
    are

    getting increasingly smaller. Farmers in small-scale agricultural ﬁelds are hesitant

    to use upgraded technology because of the high initial costs, perceived risks,
    and

    complexity of the system.

    4.

    Government support: The laws and regulations in the area where smart farming is

    being considered for implementation play a huge role in its eventual success or
    failure.

    The local governments are responsible for taking initiatives and providing funding

    and support training programs for the adoption of such tools [184]. Several successful

    initiatives taken up in the European Union [119] and across the world [144] have

    highlighted the importance of the effort taken up by regulatory bodies.

    5.

    Ethical considerations: Human safety is also a concern in the operation of unmanned

    vehicles [185]. Collisions with the ground or other objects may also cause damage

    to the vehicle. It is also essential that the UAVs be ﬂown in unrestricted areas.
    Cur-

    rently, it is not clear where the accountability for the actions taken by autonomous

    vehicles lies. Data need to be uploaded to cloud systems in a secure manner, keeping

    regulations in mind. It is necessary for smart farming operations to be transparent
    so

    that they are more trusted and accepted. The ownership of agricultural data is
    a huge

    liability that needs to be kept in mind. There are also legal and ethical considerations

    with the potential mishandling and misuse of these data [186]. Animal welfare
    is

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    451

    also a concern while making use of autonomous robots to perform functions such
    as

    milking [187].

    6.

    Regional considerations: Lack of proper infrastructure, such as roads, can be
    a major

    hurdle towards the advancement of smart farms, as the necessary resources and

    technology will not be successfully transported. There is limited availability
    of inter-

    net in rural areas, where smart farming could be of greater signiﬁcance. Standard

    protocols and frameworks for wireless communication cannot be deﬁned, as the

    requirements rely heavily on the speciﬁc use case [188]. Further, communication

    protocols implemented within the smart farm may only provide coverage over small

    areas [189].

    7. Discussion

    This review study was conducted to assess the challenges and opportunities in
    smart

    farming by exploring current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs, analyzing global projects,
    and

    understanding the perception of the general public towards such innovative practices.
    The

    two hypothesis stated at the beginning of the study have been supported by the
    ﬁndings of

    the research questions, which have been answered as follows:

    Hypothesis 3. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications.

    The following research question were crafted to accept or reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Over the last decade, several smart farming projects have been launched across
    the

    world that were powered by technologies such as IoT, wireless sensor networks,

    unmanned vehicles, etc., as detailed in Section 3. The potential use cases for
    each

    technology are discussed in Section 4, although several projects utilize more
    than one.

    Several research projects in the European Union [18] and worldwide have also been

    discussed. The development of precise sensors enables the capture of data with
    higher

    accuracy, thus enabling better quality analysis and decision making [14]. Decision

    support systems can guide the farmer with operational decisions about choice of
    crop,

    frequency of fertilizer use, better utilization of resources, and more [69]. Autonomous

    vehicles take care of labor-intensive tasks, thus freeing up farmers for other
    important

    tasks [77]. Communication between various IoT devices through a WSN can allow

    for effective monitoring of the farm throughout the day, making it easier for
    the

    farmer to make operational decisions [36]. Blockchain technology can ensure that
    the

    supply and raw materials purchased are of good quality and there is no adulteration

    taking place [48]. DTs such as artiﬁcial intelligence also have an array of potential

    applications in smart farming, building upon the availability of massive amounts

    of heterogeneous data from sensors [20]. We have discussed the use of machine

    learning and deep learning for disease identiﬁcation in crops, fruits, and cattle
    in

    Section 3.7. AI has also shown great potential in optimizing resource utilization
    by

    automating timely irrigation, performing preemptive actions if a certain parameter

    crosses a threshold, and predictive analysis of weather and crop conditions [188].
    AI

    can also be used to identify optimal conditions for growing crops and preventing
    crop

    wastage. Image processing is of great relevance in smart farming, as there have
    been

    several studies that implement CNNs [98]. Image processing can be used for livestock

    management, guiding the decision-making processes of harvesting robots and pest

    and weed elimination drones. It can also enable precision farming by collecting
    data

    from sensors and deploying resources accordingly [9].

    Hypothesis 4. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    452

    The following research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming

    tools?

    Despite the increasing number of smart farming projects being launched all over

    the world, there still exist many factors that hinder the widespread implementa-

    tion of such tools [6,188]. As we have discussed in Section 6, the limitations
    can be

    broadly categorized as lack of training and awareness, technical considerations,
    costs,

    government support, ethical considerations, and regional considerations. Technical

    difﬁculties arise due to the inability of current systems to withstand extreme
    weather

    and atmospheric conditions, being too bulky and costly to implement, and not provid-

    ing up-to-the-mark accurate data [176]. Another challenge is the proper infrastructure

    required for storing and processing large amounts of data collected from sensors
    [181].

    The privacy and security of this data is of great importance. Regional limitations

    could be the lack of infrastructure and connectivity. Smaller farms in rural areas
    could

    beneﬁt greatly from the use of smart farming tools. However, most smart farming

    practices require the use of internet connectivity, which is sparse in rural areas.
    Other

    factors that hamper the development of smart farming may include lack of techni-

    cal expertise by farmers, insufﬁcient incentives provided by the government for
    the

    implementation of such practices, and skepticism of farmers towards the beneﬁts
    of

    smart farming [28]. General awareness amongst farmers is generally low and can
    be

    increased through training programs. Although smart farming tools are generally

    black-box techniques, farmers making use of them still need to understand their

    operations so that they can consider the process reliable. Cost considerations
    could

    also make farmers skeptical towards installing new tools, as the upfront expenditure

    may be too much [183].

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regard
    to

    smart farming?

    In order to better understand user perception of smart farming technologies [166],

    we performed sentiment analysis on relevant English comments collected from

    YouTube [168], as detailed in Section 5. The comments were collected from 16 different

    videos that detailed innovative farming solutions. Then, two different approaches

    to observe user sentiment were utilized. In the ﬁrst approach, comments were man-

    ually labeled by two annotators into one of the following six categories: Praising,

    Queries, Suggestions, Undeﬁned, Hybrid and Opinion. Cohen’s Kappa coefﬁcient,

    which is the measure of inter-rater reliability, was calculated as 0.9617. This
    shows a

    high rate of agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The labels

    also show high positive correlation with each other, as depicted in Figure 10.
    Word

    clouds created for each video in Figures 8 and 9 highlight signiﬁcant words, such
    as

    ‘technology’, ‘farming’, ‘solar’, etc. In the second approach, polarity and subjectivity

    were calculated for each comment using Pattern library for Python. The polarity

    score ranges from −1 (negative) to 1 (positive) and indicates whether the sentiment

    is positive or negative. The overall polarity was calculated as 0.2092, indicating
    a

    slightly positive sentiment. The subjectivity score ranges from 0 (objective)
    to 1 (sub-

    jective) and indicates the degree of factual information or opinion in the statement.

    The overall subjectivity was calculated as 0.4352, suggesting that the comments
    were

    slightly objective. This implies that the comments discussed were fact-based rather

    than opinionated. However, only a rudimentary study was performed to determine

    user sentiment, and better results can be achieved using state-of-the-art models
    for

    sentiment analysis. In the brief overview of user sentiment conducted in the study,

    we noticed lack of user comments on informative and technical videos about smart

    farming platforms, indicating that a knowledge gap and a digital divide exists
    for

    such technologies [175], which can be detrimental to their widespread adoption.
    The

    general attitude of users towards smart farming technologies is superﬁcial, as
    the

    public is not well-informed about these topics.

    8. Conclusions

    Ensuring a sustainable food supply for the ever-increasing global population has

    become a necessity due to the unprecedented changes in the environment. The agricultural

    sector must update its practices in light of the worsening strain on land and
    water resources,

    and data-driven approaches provide such an opportunity to ensure sustainability.
    This

    study provided an overview of ICTs and DTs in automating and streamlining farming

    operations, and demonstrated how smart farming can improve crop yields by monitoring,

    disease prevention, automation of sowing and harvesting, etc. Examples of primary

    technological tools available for smart farming are IoT, unmanned vehicles, remote
    sensing,

    predictive analysis through big data, and so on. This shift towards data-driven
    approaches

    enables farming facilities to utilize available resources for maximum yield. The
    study also

    presents various challenges that are associated with large-scale implementation
    of smart

    farming practices, such as poor connectivity in rural areas, insufﬁcient funds
    and skilled

    labor, skepticism from farmers, concerns with data privacy, and more. To analyze
    the

    attitude of the public towards implementation of smart farming, we performed sentiment

    analysis on comments from YouTube channels related to smart farming. Preliminary

    ﬁndings in both user-based and transfer-learning based opinion mining suggest
    that a

    better understanding of smart farming tools would help the public in forming an
    informed

    opinion. Further advances are required to improve precision, cost, and efﬁciency
    of robots,

    sensors, and unmanned vehicles before they are readily adopted. Keeping the barriers

    to adoption for smart farming techniques in mind, the future scope of research
    would

    be to develop techniques that provide greater adaptability, ensure food sustainability,

    reduce cost, and counter the harmful affects of climate change on agriculture.
    Greater

    connectivity in rural areas could accelerate the integration of ICTs in smallholder
    farms,

    allowing them to prepare for unprecedented changes in farming conditions. Further

    research and investigation of the possible uses of DTs and ICTs is necessary to
    understand

    the challenges and opportunities in smart farming. A detailed sentiment analysis
    using

    advanced language models and inclusion of non-English comments can also provide
    greater

    insight into the expectations and opinions of digital users towards innovative
    farming

    solutions. Multidisciplinary research also needs to be conducted to elucidate
    other socio–

    economic, environmental, and technical factors that impede development and adoption
    of

    such innovations.

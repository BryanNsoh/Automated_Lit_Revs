  explanation: 'This paper constructs a thermal energy storage dispatch model for
    buildings that are intelligent and uses Phase Change Material. It also creates
    a five-dimensional model using Digital Twins Technology. The model is created
    using data from a real-time, intelligent building from its physical entity. The
    Digital Twin model is made up of five parts: the Physical Entity (PE), Virtual
    Entity (VE), Service System (SS), DTD, and CN. This model is used to investigate
    the heat loss and storage characteristics of the materials used in the PCW structures,
    which is the basis of the thermal energy storage system. It also establishes a
    thermal network model of the PCW structure and the building. The heat loss and
    storage characteristics of the materials are investigated using this model. The
    heat loss is calculated using equations that represent the heat conduction and
    heat radiation coefficients of the PCM and the outer and inner walls. The heat
    transfer of the forced air circulation is calculated as the enthalpy change difference
    between the air inlet and outlet of the PCW. The total heat load of the building
    is calculated as the sum of the controllable heat transfer and uncontrollable
    heat leakage.'
